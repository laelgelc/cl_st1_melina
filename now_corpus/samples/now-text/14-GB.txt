And it seems increasingly likely many of its members were protected by the security services . <p> With this in mind , three police investigations are duly underway : Operation Midland , Operation Fernbridge ( focusing on Elm Guest House ) and Operation Fairbank ( looking at political figures ) .

Some of its units could also be rented on short-term lets , making them perfect for non-residents to hold decadent parties or conduct fleeting affairs . <p> Intriguing in light of recent events is the fact that in 1994 , a small-circulation magazine called Scallywag published a lengthy article detailing rumours that politicians had been abusing children at Dolphin Square for 20 years . <p> ' We often have underage boys wandering around , totally lost , asking for a particular flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scallywag was , however , the very opposite of a reliable source .

Indeed , it centred on the entirely false premise that a paedophile ring was being run there by the late former Tory treasurer Lord McAlpine . <p> Only one source was named for this very serious allegation : a former care home resident called Steve Messham . <p> In 2012 , the same Mr Messham resurfaced on BBC Newsnight . He again alleged that he had been abused by a ' senior political figure ' , who was later identified on social media as Lord McAlpine , only to realise -- after being shown a photograph of the Conservative peer two days later -- that it was a case of mistaken identity . <p> The ensuing controversy saw the BBC pay ? 185,000 in damages , and led to the resignation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this new investigation is utterly rigorous - only then will Dolphin Square finally give up its secrets <p> All of which neatly illustrates the difficulty of separating truth from fantasy when dealing with historic sex abuse , along with the scale of <p> the challenge now facing investigators if they are to assemble sufficient evidence to secure any convictions . <p> The testimony of ' Nick ' provides another case in point . A professional man , who has no criminal record or apparent mental health issues , he is considered a trustworthy witness . <p> However , there is at present no physical or documentary evidence to back up many crucial aspects of his story about the Dolphin Square sex ring ( I have searched in vain , for example , for contemporary newspaper articles about a small boy being mown down on a London street in broad daylight ) . <p> Neither are the police believed to have found anyone capable of providing reliable testimony that corroborates many of ' Nick 's ' claims . <p> This fact may explain why the BBC have ( unlike the news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the more explosive aspects of his story , including suggestions that he witnessed murders carried out by senior Tories . <p> It may also explain why the police chose so publicly to announce their murder investigation -- believing , perhaps , that media coverage might be a good way to persuade other victims to come forward . <p> After all these years , attempting to substantiate even vague details of Labour MP John Mann 's tale is equally difficult . Only two members of the small team who worked with him at Lambeth are still believed to be alive . The location of one , Hayley Graham , is currently unknown , but this week I tracked the other , Jack Organ , to Almeira in Southern Spain . <p> Here , the 73-year-old retiree lives with his wife Paula Strudwick , who coincidentally is a former dominatrix who in 1997 made headlines after telling the News of the World about her lengthy affair with the Tory minister Jonathan Aitken . <p> Organ told me that in September he was contacted by police officers from London working on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to offer them much help . <p> ' I remember rumours of abuse , involving homosexuality in Lambeth children 's homes .

The tragedy , of course , is that if police had mounted a thorough investigation 30 years ago and these allegations had been tested in court , the fate of ' Nick ' and so many other young men is likely to have been very different . <p> That is why it is vital this new investigation is utterly rigorous .

@@2068238 <p> In the late 15th century , when it was home to a boy who would become Henry VIII , and again in the 1930s , when it became an art-deco party house for the textile millionaire Stephen Courtauld and his wife , Virginia , Christmas was a hectic time at Eltham Palace , as it filled with holly and ivy , candles and firelight , the kitchens working flat out and the great hall filling with guests . <p> At first glance the great hall so familiar to Henry , who enjoyed many childhood celebrations at Eltham , looks miraculously unchanged under its great hammerbeam roof , the third largest in England , built for Edward IV in the 1470s . But the historian Andrew Hann stoops and pats the stone flagged floor to reveal one of the innovations introduced by Courtauld when he took on the property in the 30s . On a cold winter evening , the slabs are not as icy as expected : this is a medieval hall with underfloor heating . <p> The great hall , which dates back to Tudor times when Eltham was the home of the future Henry VIII . Photograph : Alamy <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house from people who visited or worked here , and we 're trying to put back some of that history , " Hann says , of the ? 1.7m that English Heritage has put forward for a conservation project at Eltham Palace , the first since it completed an extensive programme of repairs and restoration after it took over the property in 1995 . <p> The plan is to open previously unseen parts of what must rank as one of its most eccentric properties : a state-of-the-art 1930s mansion attached to a 15th-century hall , surrounded by a Tudor moat , deep in suburban southeast London . <p> When Henry VIII became king in 1509 he found his waterfront palace at Greenwich more convenient and Eltham fell into decline . It was used as a barn in the 18th century , and by the early 20th century it was an indoor tennis court . In 1933 Courtauld -- brother of Samuel , who founded the Courtauld Institute -- controversially gained permission to build a new house in the grounds provided he restored Eltham 's medieval hall . <p> John Seely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had excellent society connections , as heir to a title and son of a bishop respectively , and after the second world war they became known for sensitive restoration work on bombed churches .

Many people hated the result : one critic thought it looked more 20th-century industrial than a suitable neighbour for a medieval palace , and called it " an admirably designed but unfortunately sited cigarette factory " . <p> Engineering historians say the house was probably the most advanced in England when it was finished in 1936 . It used technology borrowed from luxury ocean liners , and featured a plumbed-in vacuum cleaner driven by a motor in the cellars , a heated jungle-fresco room for the couple 's pet lemur Mah Jongg , centrally powered electric clocks , speakers relaying radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sliding walls to protect an art collection that included several Turner watercolours , and an internal and external telephone exchange . <p> The marriage between Virginia , a divorced Italian socialite , and the reserved Stephen was as eccentric as the house . Her bedroom , where her huge walk-in wardrobe is being restored , is all film star glamour with a gold tiled bathroom . His bedroom , beyond a connecting door , is monastically plain . Stephen 's library , to which he frequently removed in mid-sentence when dinner party chit-chat bored him , had only an internal phone built into the panelling , but Virginia needed five outside lines on her desk to organise her life . Most decadent of all , and astonishing to guests , the house had plentiful , luxurious and warm bathrooms . <p> The restoration work is literally peeling back the layers of history in the map room , where a secretary worked planning the Courtaulds ' long cruises on their luxury yacht . <p> To the astonishment of conservator Sarah Lambarth , a series of unsuspected , fragile 1930s wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , featuring Japanese maidens , Balinese temples , and an Irishman with a shillelagh . <p> Eltham was always a property built for parties .

More brought a piece of writing as a gift for Henry , whose " certain royal demeanour ; I mean a dignity of mind combined with a remarkable courtesy " , Erasmus noted . " The boy , during dinner , sent me a note inviting something from my pen , " Erasmus wrote . " I went home , and though the Muses from whom I had lived apart so long were unwilling , I finished a poem in three days . " Henry was eight at the time . <p> In the 1930s a visitor recalled how weekend visits began at Friday afternoon tea with a brandy bottle on the table to add a slug to each cup .

It had a bar , a larder , a sound system and an adjoining frescoed billiard room . It was not only bomb-proof but , because of Courtauld 's nightmare experience of being gassed in the Artists Rifles during the first world war , gas-proof too , with a sophisticated air exchange system . " Everyone was sure of a warm welcome with or without previous notice of their arrival or ration cards , " one happy guest recalled of the war years . <p> In 1944 , after just eight years , it all ended .

The Courtaulds gave the remaining 88 years of their lease to the Army School of Education , and moved first to Scotland , and then to Southern Rhodesia , modern Zimbabwe . <p> However , the parties clearly continued : when the army moved out and English Heritage moved in , it found a bar built into every ground floor room -- one last survivor , a 1960s bar added to the bunker , is now being removed as part of the restoration work . <p> * This article was amended on 30 December 2014 . An earlier version said the restoration project at Eltham Palace was the first since English Heritage took over the property in 1995 .

@@2209235 <p> Every so often , a writer comes along who cheers Ireland up , not because the books are cheerful -- on the contrary , indeed -- but because the writing enlarges a particular sense we have of ourselves . Claire Keegan is one such writer , John McGahern is perhaps the best known , and Donal Ryan is the latest addition to this distinguished line . He writes from the rural heartland in prose that always pushes for the truth of things . Ryan 's language is colloquial and easy , but the central emotion is , for lack of a better word , dignified . His characters are large-hearted people in a small-minded world and this timeless theme is played out , not in misty boggy nowhere-land , but in a contemporary Irish space , where people talk on their mobiles and the halal meat plant has been recently closed down . <p> The Spinning Heart , his first published novel , was told from 21 different points of view and was set after the collapse of the Irish boom . It was the success of this book that brought his first , much rejected manuscript to light . The Thing About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is , for my money , the better book . It has only one voice , that of Johnsey Cunliffe , whose slow puzzlement burns through the story like the spark on a long fuse . The explosion , when it comes , is finely judged by Ryan , who is interested in what makes men kill other people or themselves . Maleness is experienced , by his characters , as an impossible state , a kind of accident waiting to happen . McGahern is the reference point here because masculinity is an issue for both writers , their characters are often in thrall to the figure of the father , and they are both interested in knowing how to escape that love , or what it might mean . <p> Johnsey is in mourning for his father who was a paragon , tough but fair : " He 'd give ground to no man . " A farmer who took no notice of the neighbours , in their foolishness and venality , he " often talked about money as though it was only a nuisance of a thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time " . And he was tender of his son , who has few defences against the outside world . When Johnsey 's mother also dies , leaving him the land , the pressure on him to sell to local developers becomes immense . <p> Johnsey describes himself as " a bit of a gom " . His language is a reminder that the Irish have a hundred words for " stupid " and use the word " clever " as an insult all of its own . He is a bit of a God-help-us , a great clumsy yoke , a meely-mawly , an auld eejit of a crossbreed pup . We are not sure , in fact , how " stupid " Johnsey is , or how self-lacerating . The creeping reveal of his mother 's character is key to understanding his nature , perhaps . At the beginning of the book , she is a maker of powerful , tasty dinners ; by the end , " she had a tongue on her that could cut a man right in two " . <p> It is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is somehow childlike in an adult world -- but Ryan 's control is terrific . He underplays the ironic distance and pulls our sympathies tight . And he tells a great story . His paragraphs are unnoticeably beautiful , his heart always on show , and he writes with a social accuracy that is devastating . He knows the tiny differences that make all the difference -- between the small town and the countryside , between the labouring classes and those who own a few acres , between the local council tenants and the ones relocated from the city . <p> This is a world away from posh Protestant versus cute Catholic tales of yore , and different again from the airless self-enclosure of the families in McGahern 's books . People drive around and meet one another in a novel that is set in the Irish countryside . I do n't know why this seems like an amazing thing for them to do .

In the US , B Lab has worked to develop " benefit corporations , " companies that legally commit themselves to honor moral values , while pursuing the standard capitalist goal of maximizing profits . <p> In Europe , Economy for the Common Good ( ECG ) is taking a similar tack . The program , which is the brainchild of Austrian publisher and activist Christian Felber , seeks to address a capitalist system that , in its words , " creates a number of serious problems : unemployment , inequality , poverty , exclusion , hunger , environmental degradation and climate change " . The solution , ECG argues , is an economic system that " places human beings and all living entities at the center of economic activity " . <p> To realize this goal , the ECG proposes an economic system that applies the " standards for human relationships as well as constitutional values " to the economy .

@@2216231 <p> This in the new Nissan Qashqai , the second-gen version of the innovative hatchback-cum-SUV that defined the crossover segment . Rewind a decade and Nissan 's dreary core was the Primera , Almera and Tino , but the Japanese company took a brave step to abandon traditional market segment and launch the Qashqai . It has n't looked back since . <p> In essence the Qashqai was nothing more than a high-riding Almera , but the ruse worked and buyers loved the raised driving position and faux-4x4 looks in a package no bigger than a conventional ' C-segment ' hatch . <p> We Brits were smitten , and even in 2013 at the end of the original 's life , we still bought 50,000 of the things . It 's the sixth highest-selling car in the UK behind only the Ford 's Fiesta and Focus , Vauxhall 's Astra and Corsa , and the VW Golf . No pressure on the new Nissan Qashqai , then ... <h> What 's new about the new Nissan Qashqai ? <p> The design , which is an obvious success . The first Qashqai , while brave in its philosophy , was rather bland to behold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nose is more angular , the doors heavily contoured , and the plastic body cladding better integrated . <p> On the practical side , the tailgate also opens 150mm higher -- so only those of my lofty beyond six-foot disposition will now smack their heads -- but there 's no longer a Qashqai+2 with three rows of seats . Nissan reckons most customers who bought the last-generation +2 did so for the bigger boot , rather than for the sixth and seventh seats , so the new Qashqai has a 20-litre larger load area ( now 430 litres ) and the new X-Trail SUV will get a third row instead . The reversing camera is also now self-cleaning . <h> What else has Nissan done to improve the Qashqai 's abilities as a family vehicle ? <p> That larger boot now has a false floor , under which you can store the parcel shelf , and the two floor panels themselves can either be used to halve the space so the weekly shop does n't roll around on the journey home , or reversed to provide a waterproof lining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pond again . <p> In the back there 's more room in all directions for passengers , but although the seats fold flatter than before when you 've got a dead Christmas tree to lug to the tip , they do n't slide or recline , and the lack of under-thigh support proves they 're designed for kids rather than fully fledged adults . <p> Much better news in the front , where the seats are very comfortable . Nissan claims they were inspired by NASA , but if the current space race is anything to go by , then the Mk3 Qashqai will have seats inspired by the cutting edge Chinese space program instead . <p> As for the rest of the interior , there 's been a much-needed hike in overall quality , boosted by details , including an electronic handbrake that frees up useful extra stowage space . It 's not all plaudits for the Qashqai cabin though , as the sat-nav screen has now been dropped out of your line of sight and the centre console design is much more generic than the Mk1 Qashqai 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Qashqai drive ? <p> The new Qashqai is 40kg lighter than before , but there 's also been a backwards step . The Mk1 Qashqai was underpinned by multi-link rear suspension , but to cut weight , and therefore CO2 emissions ( and cost , too ) the Mk2 Qashqai has torsion beam rear suspension . You do get a multi-link rear if you opt for the 4x4 version , but it 's beam on the back on front-wheel drive models , which will make up the majority of sales in the UK . <p> Most buyers will probably never notice the switch , but Nissan has introduced double-piston dampers and Active Ride Control to compensate for this . The dampers combat both large but low-frequency bumps on rougher roads , and smaller higher-frequency imperfections on smoother surfaces ; the Active Ride Control subtly applies the brakes to reduce body pitch and movement over expansion joints , speed bumps and the like . <h> Does the tech work ? <p> Sure does . The fact that our test car rode on 19in wheels shows how far the Mk2 Qashqai has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite a little patter from the big alloys , the new-gen rides rather smoothly and over big bumps , while the Active Ride Control ties down the rear promptly . More impressive is the step forward in refinement , the Achilles heel of the original . Engine , road and wind noise are all much better suppressed , even if the huge doors mirrors create a little too much roar . <p> We 're driving the 1.5 dCi diesel -- only available as a front-wheel drive manual -- which will be the biggest seller thanks to its 99g/km CO2 emissions , but that means only 109bhp and 192lb ft , so it 's not quick . Opt for the 1.6 dCi and there 's another 20bhp and 44lb ft , plus the choice of a CVT or four-wheel drive ( but not the two together ) . <p> We also tested the 1.6 dCi with the auto ' box in front-drive form , and not only is it more sprightly than the 1.5 dCi , but the CVT is surprisingly adept too , maintaining low revs if you 're ambling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're accelerating hard , and only occasionally getting caught out and incessantly holding high revs . Still , go for the bigger engine matched to the manual transmission , we say . <p> There 's also Normal and Sport weightings for the electric steering , the latter a smidge heavier but with little real difference between the pair , and there 's also a new Active Trace Control system which gently applies the brakes to reduce understeer when you 've overcooked a roundabout . Overall the driving experience is safe , secure , and sedate , yet not quite as invigorating as the original which was rather fun to fling around . <h> Verdict <p> More mature than before , the new Qashqai is n't quite as daring as the original , but the improvements in quality , refinement and CO2 emissions will only make it even more popular in the UK.

@@2229237 <h> Study : asteroid mining might not be commercially viable <p> Asteroid mining may not be commercially viable after all , a Harvard astrophysicist has said . <p> The claim by Martin Elvis of the Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics was made in a paper published in the journal Planetary and Space Science , posted online at Arxiv.org . He sought to quantify how many ore-bearing near-Earth objects ( NEOs ) there are , with ore classed as a commercially viable material , in particular those from the platinum group metals ( PGMs ) and water . His research was based on the premise that there 's no point launching missions that will demand huge expenditure , unless we know with some degree of certainty that we are likely to strike gold -- or platinum , in this case . <p> Quite troubling for the likes of Planetary Resources and Deep Space Industries ( DSI ) , two companies in the midst of planning for launches of cubesats to carry out asteroid recon missions , Elvis ' estimates put the number of PGM-carrying asteroids at just ten , or one percent of known NEOs , and water at around 9,000 -- though he says these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Water-bearing asteroids bigger than 100m in diameter , he puts at 18 . <p> The equations his finds are based on take into account delta-v , the velocity rate needed to reach the asteroid and return . This in itself has to be commercially viable , taking into account distance from Earth and additional velocity needed for the return trip . <p> " The return delta-v is more important than the outbound delta-v because a much larger mass of ore needs to be returned than the mass of the mining equipment sent out , " writes Elvis . " Small changes in delta-v make for large differences in the mass that can reach an NEO . <p> " Choosing an NEO with delta-v = 4.5 km s-1 can double , or even quadruple , the payload delivered to the NEO compared with the median . This value includes only a small fraction of all known NEOs . " <p> The problem , according to Elvis , is there are few NEOs in the delta-v range he has calculated that are larger than 100m in diameter -- that small size reduces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2,000 . <p> " As 100m diameter NEOs are needed to have a value worth mining and the population of NEOs larger than 100 m diameter is around 20,000 , the total population of PGM ore-bearing NEOs is roughly 10 , " the paper concludes . <p> The precious minerals he focussed on included platinum , rhodium , osmium , iridium , palladium and rhenium , all elements that are rare in the Earth 's crust because they dissolve in molten iron so are generally trapped in the Earth 's core . These , he says , provide the " most promising enterprise for asteroid hunters , because of their high value on Earth " and will be found on M-type asteroids which are known to deliver PGM-rich nickel-iron meteorites to Earth . Water was also focused on because it 's been predicted it will be the first product that is mined : " it would be used in space either for life support or , separated into hydrogen and oxygen for rocket fuel . " <p> Speaking to the BBC , Planetary Resources cofounder Eric Anderson poked a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NEOs most likely to contain PGMs are C-type , not M-type as Elvis says , and that Planetary Resources will include asteroids that need a delta-v of 7km/s . " I think the study is probably off by a factor of 100 , conservatively , and I think it 's off by a factor of 1,000 optimistically , " Anderson concluded in the interview . <p> Elvis does , however , continually point out in his research paper that the estimates are conservative , and that far more work needs to be done to improve upon these predictions . In fact , the paper is more of a call to action that a warning from a naysayer . <p> " The apparently limited supply of potentially profitable NEOs argues strongly for an accelerated rate both for discovery and especially for characterisation , which is lagging badly behind discovery , " writes Elvis . " At the expected discovery rate of about 2,000 NEOs/year from 2015 onwards ... it will take a decade or so to essentially complete the discovery surveys . <p> " Significant research is needed in all areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and on both of these together for the small asteroids about to impact the Earth , on local assay probes , and on in-space engineering challenges , both at the ISS and with a returned small asteroid . " <p> It might be , Elvis suggests , that before the actual business of mining explodes , a secondary business based on discovery and identification of ore-bearing asteroids might emerge .

You should 5-2-ing your entire life , according to a new book by writer Emma Cook . <p> The book , published earlier this month , tells us the principles of the5:2 diet , where you eat what you want for five days of the week and starve yourself for the other two ( sorry , I mean , eat 500 calories if you 're a woman ) , can be applied to fitness , drinking , relationships , money , worry , productivity , screen time and environment . <p> The rules are pretty simple : work out five days of the week you do n't have to worry about going to the gym , money or problems in your life , and two days where you will tackle them head on . Work out two days in the week where you 'll specifically dedicate time to your relationship/ kids/ friends and five days where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your bit . And so on , until you 've covered all the different elements of your life . <p> Thinking about this gives me a headache . I get the 5:2 diet . I was on it last year and it worked . In fact , by watching what I ate for two days a week , within a month I was able to maintain the same body weight as if I 'd been watching what I ate every day and exercising regularly . While I was on the 5:2 , I barely worked out . ( I 'm not saying that 's a good thing , I 'm just saying , the 5:2 works if you want to lose extra pounds . ) <p> However , applying the 5:2 philosophy to every area of my life ? The only way I could remember what I was supposed to be doing , when , is to write it all down in some big spreadsheet ( e.g. Weds and Thurs relationship days ; Mondays and Fridays gym days ; Sunday and Wednesdays , no-alcohol days -- and so on ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do enough planning ahead at work : do I really want to make my entire life one big routine ? <p> Perhaps yes , actually . There is one area of the book I am rather tempted to follow . 5 for the relationship , 2 for you . Well , not so much the relationship part -- more just , the ' 2 for you ' part . <p> Two whole days of the week where I do something I want to do , for me , to " retain my sense of self " , the book says . <p> And what better way to start this new philosophy off than visiting a spa in attempt to " refind myself " and set myself up well for the year ahead . If 5:2-ing my life means more massages and manicures , I 'm all for it , after all . <p> With that in mind , I sought out a local-ish spa I could visit at the weekend . Delightfully , the spa I went to ( Whittlebury Hall , in the Northamptonshire countryside ) felt like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real sense of escape . I stayed overnight with a friend and we had a good old gossip and chin wag over dinner -- that alone was worth the trip . <p> One of my new year 's resolutions is to focus on me a bit more ( urgh , I know , it sounds so clich ? ) so this has set the year up well . <h> The stress of stress-free spas <p> However , I do n't usually ' do ' spas . Call me a spoilt brat , but I find the whole experience quite stressful : lots of gaggling , shouty women on hen nights all grouped together in hot and steamy sauna rooms chatting about this and that , and what Mark said , and then what Charlie said and how Katy ended up doing this ...

I 'm always told to wake up , put my robe back on , get out as quickly as possible so the next lady can get in ... You go from almost being asleep ( perfect ) , to being abruptly awoken . <p> Perhaps this is why I do n't , actually , put enough time aside for ' me ' . Because the clich ? way of ' me time ' -- sitting in a white robe trying to feel relaxed in the middle of nowhere -- subconsciously makes me stressed . My colleague and I commented the other day that we 're often both too stressed to enjoy relaxing . Going from a busy busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spa is perhaps too much of a contrast .

Since when has ' relaxing ' been too stressful ? I really need to get a grip . It comes back to my NY reso -- if I want to spend time on me , I have to make time for me . There are some websites out there , like SpaSeekers , which allow you to book the kind of spa experience you want , too . Obviously , you do n't always have to spend all day , or weekend , at a spa . Perhaps just a quick treatment in a local day spa would do it -- and you can turn up impromptu in many of them . <p> So perhaps what I should do is book a series of spa treatments up and down the country throughout the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope I end up as far north as Leicestershire , where I know there is a very good spa hotel ) and force myself to enjoy ' me time ' .

But I can start booking them as and when under the pretence I 'm tidying up my life and ' revolutionising ' my world , as the book claims . And what could be wrong with that ? <p> SpaSeekers offers a carefully selected collection of over 350 spa venues in the UK . It also carries a ' best price ' guarantee , so no other website sells the same spa package for less .

Fellow sex workers say a Met police campaign to drive them off the streets had forced her to work on her own , leading to her murder <p> Mariana Popa , a Romanian , had been in England only three weeks when she was killed in Redbridge , east London . Campaigners say police patrols forced women to work on their own , endangering their safety . Photograph : Mark St George/REX <p> Shortly after midnight Mariana Popa staggered into Chicken &amp; Pizza 4U and collapsed . Moments earlier , the 24-year-old had been stabbed in the chest while working as a prostitute on Ilford Lane , an austere thoroughfare in the east London borough of Redbridge that for years has doubled as a strip for sex workers . <p> The murder of Mariana on 29 October received cursory media coverage , yet it is only as further details have emerged that the killing has reinvigorated the long-running debate around prostitution and , specifically , prompted fresh questions over how police approach it . <p> Friends and campaigners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's death : the police . They argue that the Romanian 's death has exposed the consequences of traditional enforcement tactics and grimly articulates the need for a mature debate on society 's attitude towards prostitution . <p> Now two of Britain 's most senior police chiefs concerned with the issue have entered the fray , denouncing the police approach to prostitution as a mess and saying that operations to tackle the trade are " counterproductive " and likely to put the lives of women at risk . Dismissing legislation as " outdated " , they call for a change in the law to allow a group of women to work together . <p> Chris Armitt , the national police lead on prostitution in England and Wales , also called for a review of enforcement tactics aimed at prosecuting prostitutes . " We are not going to enforce our way out of this problem . It simply wo n't work . I feel it would be good to allow a small group of women to work together , otherwise it creates a situation where they are working away from other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outweigh the advantages . " <p> Armitt , the assistant chief constable of Merseyside police , added that attempting to eradicate the trade was futile . " We are not going to stop prostitution . It goes back to Roman times and goes on in every country in the world . " <p> His concern is echoed by Martin Hewitt , the lead for adult sexual offences at the Association of Chief Police Officers , who said that prosecuting sex workers while using them as traditional sources of intelligence exposed inconsistencies in the strategy . <p> " We are policing a 21st-century style of prostitution with legislation that 's fairly dated . We have very contradictory actions . On the one hand we sit down with sex workers asking them to trust us and give us information . On the other hand we are doing enforcement actions . We are all working off outdated legislation , " he added . <p> Hewitt , the deputy assistant commissioner of Scotland Yard , also condemned some of the high-profile police operations such as brothel raids as superficial and offering little value other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was murdered , friends believe Popa was working late to pay off a fine for soliciting issued as part of a police campaign to drive prostitutes from the street . More crucially , she was working alone . <p> Sex workers usually operate in a group for protection , pointing out dodgy clients to one another , identifying men who have turned violent in the past . Popa would have needed the group more than most -- she had arrived from Romania just three weeks earlier . <p> When Popa was killed , the Met were running an enforcement campaign , Operation Clearlight , against sex workers in Redbridge , particularly Ilford Lane . To avoid detection by patrolling officers , the women were forced to work on their own . <p> Some are unequivocal that Clearlight contributed to Popa 's death . Georgina Perry of Open Doors , an NHS project working with sex workers in east London , said : " During the enforcement operation , women were running from police and hiding behind cars to avoid them . I have seen women taking their shoes off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run away fast from the police . " She said that women did not even dare to carry condoms because officers could use them as evidence that the women were soliciting for sex . <p> Monica Abdala of Redbridge Street Pastors , which has been helping sex workers on Ilford Lane since 2010 , said her organisation had met the police to share concerns that enforcement operations were endangering women . <p> " The police were constantly out there on patrol , that was the one thing that influenced what happened to Mariana . It does not help when the police do operations , arresting women , arresting men . It makes the women spread out ; it makes the women work harder . They have to go up alleys where there are no cameras . " <p> Armitt is among a number of high-ranking officers gravely uncomfortable with the tactic of enforcement operations against on-street sex workers . " We know that men who attack sex workers go on to attack other women . Where there have been robust and overt police enforcement operations , shortly afterwards we see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But Clearlight continued after Popa 's murder . Six days before Christmas , barely 100m from the fast-food outlet where she collapsed , an Open Doors team found residents battering another Romanian sex worker . The woman said she was simply hiding behind a wall to avoid a police patrol . The residents claimed she was attempting to break into their property . The woman was beaten so mercilessly that she required hospital treatment . She was due to return to Romania the following day . The police did not pursue charges . <p> Perry alleges that police can be callous towards sex workers . " I have at least three reports of women trying to report crimes against them going into a police station and basically being told : ' It 's your lookout , it 's your problem , what do you expect ? ' " From one perspective , however , Clearlight has worked . Hardly anyone is working the strip . Local police proudly reveal how earlier this month there were four consecutive days when no prostitutes were seen on Ilford Lane . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been campaigning for sex workers to leave appears to have won , despite police accepting that the prostitutes have merely been displaced . <p> Inspector Bob Lands at Redbridge says that police have received letters of praise from residents for targeting sex workers but is also quick to express doubt over the enforcement campaign . " We are in a difficult position . We see the girls as victims , and enforcement is n't always the way to work hand in hand with that . Fining prostitutes is n't the best answer , as it perpetuates the cycle of reoffending . " <p> Abdala cites a conversation she had with a sex worker last Tuesday who was desperately trying to pay off fines totalling ? 1,350 . Such arrears , she says , will almost certainly lead to a woman taking more risks as she solicits business while hoping to evade the police . The baffling nature of the law -- it is not illegal to work alone indoors but is illegal to work in a group -- is not lost on Armitt : " This makes the individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Despite the considerable evidence that enforcement endangers women , Operation Clearlight continues . In the Loxford area of Redbridge , which includes Ilford Lane , the number of prostitution cautions issued last year rose by almost 70% year on year . Operation Clearlight resulted in 32 arrests . <p> Latest figures relating to Clearlight reveal that , since last September , eight prostitutes have been arrested for prostitution offences , along with 17 men for kerb crawling , seven of whom have been charged and are due to appear at Redbridge magistrates court next Friday . <p> At the same time there is a backdrop of violence against the sex workers of Ilford Lane . Every woman interviewed by Abdala 's organisation had been a victim of violence . " Last year we saw more than 200 women -- every single one had experienced violence against them , " she said . Such a sustained level of violence might appear shocking , but does not surprise those familiar with the risks of on-street prostitution .

The mood was tense , prostitutes divulging how last month 's brothel raids had seen one woman dragged from her flat in her underwear ; another recounted how 40 officers stormed her digs with dogs . <p> Before the raids , the Met had tipped off the media , inviting photographers to document the operation . Some women were aghast that their photos had appeared in the press . <p> Hewitt concedes that such raids can be gimmicks with little inherent police value . " Brothel raids are great at achieving good pictures . The whole objective is to try to resolve the problem . I 'm not sure that this kind of activity provides us with a sustainable solution . A straightforward raid does n't necessarily attack all aspects of the issue . " <p> The figures appear to corroborate such criticism . Eighteen months of intelligence gathered against Soho 's sex workers as part of Operation Demontere , which targeted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , resulted in not one trafficking case being identified . Only three women in brothels were charged with handling stolen goods . Undercover officers were deployed as sellers of stolen mobile phones and other goods . <p> One Soho maid embroiled in the raids said : " The vice squad used to visit the Soho flats every three months , take down the girls ' names and addresses , ask if there were any problems and then leave . It 's not like that now . I think the police need to turn round and say sorry to those girls and think about the consequences of their actions . " <p> Another Soho sex worker , Vicky , 31 , from Poland , who is unemployed following last month 's raids , said the trade was now too unsafe following the closure notices given to some sex flats during the police crackdown . " Now I can not work and my lifestyle has changed completely . In the flat in Soho I was safe and secure . We had cameras and if I did n't like the look of someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water , not alcohol , and my only vice is three cigarettes a day . As sex workers in Soho , we do n't take drugs and we do n't sell drugs . We only sell sex . " Of the Soho flats used for sex work , 15 have been closed as a result of the raids last month ; 25 are still open . <p> Niki Adams of the English Collective of Prostitutes , which is campaigning against the Soho brothel closures , said : " Mass arrests and criminalisation need to stop . " <p> It is England 's second city that offers the most obvious way forward for the Met . In Birmingham , the police responded to concerns from sex workers by ditching the use of asbos and aggressive policing tactics in favour of " softly-softly " tactics . The change in stance in 2012 is credited with vastly improving the sex workers ' safety . <p> A spokeswoman for the city 's Anawim women 's centre said : " All the asbo stuff did was simply move the women around without solving anything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase the violence because women were jumping in cars without checking . Sometimes there would be three or four men in a car and they were getting gang- raped . " <p> Armitt believes that the use of asbos against sex workers simply drove them underground . " Asbos are not an effective remedy for policing street sex work , " he said . <p> Yet , even in Birmingham , new policing priorities have prompted a rise in enforcement operations that has prompted consternation among sex workers . <p> In Edinburgh , too , the era of tolerance seemingly ended with a series of police raids on saunas last summer . Progressive Edinburgh had even introduced a tolerance zone for prostitutes in 2001 . When that was axed following opposition from residents it provoked a 400% increase in reports of violence against sex workers , according to the sex-worker advocacy group , Scot-Pep . <p> Meanwhile , concern surrounds the Home Office-funded Ugly Mugs scheme , which was launched in July 2012 and allows sex workers to anonymously report attacks but whose funding is due to expire in April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex workers were reported between July 2012 and July 2013 , of these 106 were sexual assaults and 68 were rapes .

Sweden has controversially pioneered such an approach , with Norway following suit -- and France last month . Elsewhere , Canada has overturned the law banning brothels , arguing that it prevents women from working together in a safe environment , while New Zealand has decriminalised sex work . Here , the Home Office remains unswervingly intransigent on the issue , insisting that there are no plans to review prostitution laws .

@@2245239 <p> What do the numbers tell us about Januzaj 's best position ? And what does he have in common with red legend , Cristiano Ronaldo ? @SleepyNik explains more ... There have been few Manchester United players to emerge from the opening half of the season with their reputations enhanced , but one such player is the Belgian sensation , Adnan Januzaj . His form has been the one shining light in a dark and dour start to David Moyes ' United career ; form that suggests that the hype around the teenager from all quarters is fully justified . <p> As Sir Alex Ferguson himself put it before retiring , " Adnan has a great future , he is a beautifully balanced player . He 's only 18 and has to grow into his frame but he has good balance , good acceleration and is a very good technical player . " Astute as ever , Ferguson highlighted the three key aspects to Januzaj 's game , attributes you could argue were exemplified at a similar age in Cristiano Ronaldo 's United career . But where is the youngster 's best position likely to be ? And could we see a similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Left side or right side ? A graceful player who can seemingly play anywhere across the final third , it is indeed Januzaj 's balance and acceleration ( and strength of mind ) that Ferguson mentions that has set him apart ; being able to sprint well per se is much less beneficial to the sharp change of pace he demonstrates , allowing him to escape the clutches of the chasing defender , and offering him more time on the ball . Januzaj controls the ball well at pace , and this term he has successfully executed an average of 1.9 dribbles per game ( to put that stat into context , Hazard averaged 1.8 last season , and Ronaldo averages 2.1 ) , and his performances have yielded a higher match rating ( 7.45 as opposed to 6.95 overall ) when played on the left side -- particularly high up . <p> Januzaj links well with Patrice Evra ( the pair exchanged 17 passes versus Southampton alone ) , often using the Frenchman 's overlapping runs as a decoy , allowing him to drift infield and create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 8 of his 50 attempted crosses in the league , the stat says a lot more about United 's lack of attacking dynamism and finesse than it does about his crossing ability . As we can see from his set piece delivery , Januzaj has the ability to cross accurately and with speed ; versus West Ham and Swansea at home too he was unplayable at times , using his ability to jinx past his man on the outside and cross from the by-line . <p> So does this mean he is a shoe-in to follow in Ryan Giggs ' footsteps , plying his trade down the left wing ? Well not exactly . Picking up on the third attribute Ferguson alluded to then , Januzaj is the very definition of a technical player who has the ability to choose the right pass under pressure . The youngster is equally adept on the right side of the pitch , and his Ozil-esque assist for Welbeck against Tottenham at Old Trafford last month is a testament to his approach there . Often this season he has indeed mirrored Mesut Ozil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come inside on his stronger left foot , he continually surveys the landscape ahead of him , trying to play the short pass into the forward 's feet before creating an angle for the return ball . In fact , it is no surprise to see the opposition target the player when he gets the ball given his fantastic vision ; Januzaj is fouled a staggering 2.8 times per game ( as a comparison Luis Suarez has been fouled 1.9 times per game ) . <p> The ' inverted winger ' approach is nothing new , and Januzaj clearly prefers the left side at the present time ( particularly too , as Valencia has rediscovered his verve ) , but there is surely mileage in offering him greater opportunities from the right , as it is here that the youngster could potentially cause most harm in future . In his 16 appearances so far for United in the league ( with 6 coming from the bench ) , Januzaj has started just twice on the right side ( averaging a 6.76 match rating ) -- but crucially , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than when over on the left side ( perhaps due to greater defensive duties required there ) . <p> He has , however , averaged over 2 shots ( 2.1 ) on goal per game ( more than double that of say , Juan Mata 's count ) , shooting a remarkable 6 times versus Sunderland away in the league alone , and scoring 3 goals overall . Creating space to shoot from deep is a difficult task in an era of defensive caution ( with many sides seeking to deploy two central players in front of the back four ) , and with a right starting berth , he is able to create these openings himself , coming inside on his left foot -- allowing him further opportunities there would surely bolster this statistic ( a goal-scoring midfielder is fast becoming a rare breed at Old Trafford ) . Shooting from range also exemplifies a quality that he has in abundance : confidence in his own ability -- bringing us nicely back to the Ronaldo ' comparison ' . <p> Januzaj 's ability to run at the defender at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opening for a shot at goal , could certainly be an area of his game to explore in what would be a high right-sided attacking position -- though he certainly has a long way to go to match Ronaldo 's startling 7.8 shots per game . Carlos Queiroz famously coached the ex-red 's dynamism in this respect ( with Mourinho applying the finishing touches in a left-sided attacking role at Madrid ) , and of course Januzaj 's similar development would be a huge ask ; but crucially , he has the years he has ahead of him . It would also be a big ask of Moyes ' tactical philosophy on the basis of what we have seen so far , and should such an advanced right position become his in future , United would need to develop a more cohesive 4-2-3-1 approach . <p> Januzaj as a number 10 ? Given Januzaj 's ability to play both as a traditional winger , and a schemer coming in from the right , what are his chances of becoming a true number 10 ? So far he has only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , versus Swansea at home in the league , and for two thirds of the game against Chelsea at the Bridge . Against Swansea in particular , Januzaj seemed to thrive in the role , and claimed man of the match with a rating of 7.73 ; against Chelsea , his elegant movement was beyond his years , continually dragging the centre half out , before darting beyond Ivanovic at right back . But of course , to play here on a regular basis is a different proposition entirely , and though he clearly has the awareness and ability on the ball -- using both feet with aplomb -- again the current United system has hindered his long-term prospects here ( as it has Shinji Kagawa ) . <p> He also has a certain Wayne Rooney to contend with , and the Englishman plays the ' 10 ' role like no other in world football ( Rooney averages 2.4 key passes per game , set against Adnan 's 1.1 ) , his combative nature suiting the Moyes approach to 4-4-1-1 , which is what makes him so vital . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this role ) , Januzaj has assisted only 2 goals in the league ( a reflection also of United 's overall form ) , but has been successful in his ability to pick the right opportunity for the through ball ( something Kagawa has tried , but failed , to bring to the side on a consistent basis ) , completing 6 from 7 passes into the attacking player . Januzaj 's 79.9% pass completion success is not bad , and his ball retention would surely improve from the centre , as would the total amount of passes he plays ( he currently averages only 24 per game from out wide ) . His long-range passing is an area for development but improving by the game , having completed only 14 from 25 attempted long balls so far this campaign . <p> In the number 10 role , Januzaj would undoubtedly have to improve his defensive acumen and pressing game , which has become key to the modern adaptation of the role . Think Iniesta for Barcelona ( rather than ' noughties Riquelme ' ) , who , whilst not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- his pressing game is essential to the role and at 1.9 tackles per game , that is more than double that of Januzaj ( 0.9 ) . Intercepting the ball high up the field is also important , and Januzaj completes only 0.7 interceptions per game , half that of Kagawa 's rate ( 1.4 ) . Whilst only in his first season at the highest level , Januzaj is prone to losing the ball too easily , being dispossessed 2.4 times per game on average . The manager will also have the option of starting him further ahead , something between 9 and 10 , or the ' Messi approach ' , allowing the starlet to drop deep to receive the ball before running directly at opponents . <p> Conclusion So , there we have it . Despite Januzaj being so young and so raw , it is not an exaggeration to say that he has indeed the capacity to play anywhere in the attacking zone -- and we are likely to see him deployed in a variety of positions in the coming years . As the boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play in midfield or as an inside winger but I can also play as a number 10 behind the striker or a number 8 , or I can play on the wings as well . Last year , I played striker for the reserves , so I can help the team in each position . " <p> For now , Januzaj will likely continue to add panache to United 's attack from both sides of the field , strutting his stuff predominantly from the inside left position that he is making his own . But do n't be surprised to see his long-term future on the right , particularly if he can develop physically , honing his skills and attributes that have made him a creative threat in front of goal . Starting as a central playmaker ( either in the Ozil mode , or something of a false 9 ) will always be an option for David Moyes , but given the system and the players around him , you feel this might come much later in the Belgian 's career . <p> Adnan Januzaj shares a birthday -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Cristiano Ronaldo , and similar playing characteristics to the player United signed from Sporting Lisbon over ten years ago . How United fans would love the youngster to follow in the Portuguese 's footsteps in terms of impact , and should he provide even half the memories for the Old Trafford faithful , it would be an absolute delight .

Valls told newspaper Le Parisien : ' Dieudonne has been repeatedly condemned for defamation , insult and incitement to racial hatred . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the greatest firmness , under the law .

It is also capable of causing reproductive problems and damaging the immune system . <p> As our report shows , high levels of dioxin can still be found in some 2,4-D mixtures .

@@2277237 <p> Dracula is n't a book , not anymore . Dracula is a name , a broad stereotyping of a character which encompasses many different components and interpretations of our favourite Count . Having been a fan of the concept of vampires for some time , earlier this year I was intrigued to return to the beginning of the vampire genre when I first picked up this book . <p> The novel is a fascinating entity , not least because of the differences from the modern perception of it . For example , there is the fact that the Count himself is n't hurt by sunlight , a concept which was only introduced in the silent film Nosferatu many years later . This fact is indicative of a problem which arises for any modern reader of Stoker 's novel , namely , we 're modern and so have a lot of pop culture baggage to contend with whenever we try to get drawn into the novel . <p> Events which would act as gigantic plot twists to the readers of Stoker 's era are easily predictable which does diminish from the impact somewhat . However it does lend the whole story a level of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chilling and almost Cassandrian feeling of ignored prophecies and a predetermined fate . What was in the original story a mere subplot with the ignored warnings of the locals dooming Jonathan Harker to his fate becomes , via the fact that we all know the story , a major theme which colours every scene in the book . <p> The book also features many details and plot points unfamiliar to someone who knows Dracula only from their general pop culture sensitivity , allowing the reader to have the best of both worlds , granting the eerie inevitability of Jonathan Harker 's approach to the castle an extra layer of dread while keeping certain plot twists surprises . Or at least , that was my experience upon reading it . <p> However , to move away from my arguments for why you should read Dracula despite almost certainly already knowing the ending ( SPOILER : Dracula loses ) and into the actual story , let me give you a quick overview of the beginning of the book . <p> It begins with Jonathan Harker 's journey through Transylvania to Dracula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dracula is not someone you want to visit after dark . It is in this section that everything I was talking about above really comes into play . <p> The dramatic build up to the meeting with Dracula is very tense and scary , perhaps more so with the audience already knowing that Jonathan 's apparently amiable host is anything but . The entire first part of the book is an exercise in dread , with Jonathan slowly realising that his host is something inhuman and utterly evil . It is brimming with paranoia and a feeling of the unknowable . It 's told entirely via diary entries which only adds to that , enabling us to look into Jonathan 's slowly cracking psyche as he begins to make connections and associations between the Count and the horrors of the night . The reader becomes part of the story , experiencing that fear and paranoia via the fact that Jonathan 's journal is written for himself , placing us in his shoes . <p> Not a huge amount happens in this first section of the story but it very much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older books is the fact that they tend not to be as gripping as modern books . That is not a problem with Dracula , the warnings of things in the night begin only a few pages in and the story grabs you and wo n't let go , making your fear for Jonathan 's safety increase with every sentence . <p> After this beginning section , which takes about sixty pages , giving it enough time to breath , we cut back to Whitby in England and a correspondence between Lucy Westenra and Mina Murray , our two female heroes . It 's here that the book begins to flag a bit and the long , if beautiful , passages dealing with everyday Victorian life begin . This section is told entirely in letters meaning that we now get two different perspectives , ridding us of the tense , clammy paranoia of Jonathan 's journal . It leaves the reader desperately thinking on Jonathan 's fate as we watch his fianc ? e and her friend discuss the weather . With the love triangle which surrounds Lucy it begins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crashes and the story starts in earnest . <p> I shall not go any further in outlining the plot , most of you probably know the basics of the rest and there are still some things I would wish to leave as surprises for those of you who are not aware of the finer plot details of the novel . I chose this section specifically as it is representative of the story as a whole , it cuts from tense paranoid first person journal sections to lighter sections of conversation via letters or multiple journal entries . The fact that the book is told entirely via these documents adds to a ' found footage ' feel with us being privy to the thoughts of many characters and allowed a look at how their minds work . It gives the whole story a sense of foreboding as you wonder how all the papers were collected together , something which is also exploited by many modern horror films ( cough , Blair Witch Project , cough ) . <p> On a side note , it is curious how many gothic stories use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hogg 's Confessions of A Justified Sinner is told in a rather meta-fictional way via another such device , but that is beside the point . Dracula 's device of letters really enables you to understand and sympathise with the characters and see their true thoughts as they try to defeat Dracula . The book plays with this format telling the story in telegrams and diary entries printed in newspapers which are then cut out as newspaper clippings as well as straight journal entries . <p> The main characters are all very well portrayed , each with a separate personality , quirks and role to play in the story . The story itself is heartbreaking , full of the emotion of the characters as they deal with life , death and love , this is beautifully realised . Dracula touches on many themes , savagery , love , religion , technology and xenophobia to name just a few . It leaves you thinking upon it for a long time afterwards and is required reading for any fan of horror or vampires . Dracula is to vampire novels as A Study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first , greatest and the story which introduced the character for those genres .

' It is when you are not playing well that the goals never happen and you wo n't score . " <p> Altidore 's lack of goals this season -- he scored against Chelsea in the league in December and Milton Keynes Dons in the Capital One Cup in August -- would have led to a prolonged period on the sidelines at many clubs , but Poyet has stood loyally by his muscular forward and Johnson understands why . <p> " Jozy is a striker and will want to score goals , there 's nothing wrong in that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have scored when the team has won 3-0 . <p> Gus Poyet 's Sunderland face Hull City at home on Saturday GETTY <p> " Ask any forward that question and they will all say the same thing , but he was one of the main reasons why we won so convincingly at Newcastle . <p> " I watched a TV programme recently on Kevin Phillips and they asked him the question ' Were you always disappointed if the team had won and you had n't scored ? ' <p> " He gave an honest answer and said ' yes ' . I think any top striker has got to have that element in them and Kevin was obviously a great finisher . He was disappointed when he came off the pitch without scoring a goal and I 'm sure Jozy is the same .

" The main thrust of what we do here is around reducing isolation and loneliness , " says Jewish Care chief executive Simon Morris . <p> " When we built this , it was really important to me that this was a centre for the community . The idea is that it is used from eight in the morning to 11 at night . " <p> The idea has become a reality .

" As three young guys we did n't have much money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , which reduces the time we can put into the business .

" <p> " Also make sure you talk to your university , most unis provide some sort of support to student entrepreneurs -- we 've found Swansea and Leicester Universities really helpful . " <p> Although it was a challenge , it looks as if Mr University has come out on top .

" <p> For Max , the spark behind Mr University was " realising that once my degree is over I 'll be in the same over saturated jobs market competing for employment with millions of others " . <p> " And setting up a business based around what you love is a beautiful thing , " he adds . <p> It seems odd to think that for some , it 's easier to start your own business than get a graduate job , but at the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Mr University doing for students ' fitness ? It seems like it 'd be hard for the average student , living mostly on Tesco Value frozen pizza , to get big biceps and washboard abs - but David , recent Aerospace Engineering graduate from the University of Leicester , disagrees . <p> " New members are joining all the time and finding their fitness with MASS ( Muscle and Athletic Sports Society ) . <p> " With Mr University we 're aiming to use the competition as a showpiece event but we want to change people 's attitudes towards fitness and healthy living . We also plan to help complete beginners get involved in fitness and healthy living , by providing information like workout and diet plans . " <p> And with all the boys training for a reasonable six to seven hours a week , it might not be too much of a time investment if you fancy getting big for next year 's Mr University . <p> Just make sure you do n't sit next to a Mr University entrant in the library <p> And with entrants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr University for one year , a photo shoot with a professional fitness photographer , and automatic funded entry to Fit Factor , a bodybuilding competition at BodyPower Expo 2014 , you might be tempted . <p> Mr University is at the Leicester O2 Academy on 16 March , and is set to be " a celebration of the student athlete where you 'll find out what it takes to achieve a dream body whilst at Uni and be inspired to achieve " .

Despite the trade winds and sunshine , it was spending more than 16% of its economy on importing 6,500 barrels of diesel fuel a day to generate electricity . People were furious at the tripling of energy prices in 10 years and the resulting spiralling costs of imported water and food . <p> That changed at the Rio earth summit in 2012 , when the prime minister , Mike Eman , announced that the former oil-producing Dutch island close to Venezuela planned to switch to 100% renewables by 2020 . <p> Working with the independent US energy group the Rocky Mountain Institute and the business NGO Carbon War Room , Aruba ditched its old steam turbines for more efficient engines and changed the way it desalinated seawater . <p> It cost $300m ( ? 183m ) , says the energy minister and deputy PM Mike D'Emeza , but Aruba immediately halved its fuel consumption and saved itself $85m a year .

We realised that our dependency on fossil fuels was leading to political and economic instability . We had to act , " De Meza says . <p> Aruba is already enjoying health and economic benefits .

" <p> This is the same line taken by UKIP leader Nigel Farage when he visited Edinburgh last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protesters and having to take refuge in a pub . <p> He said : " We heard these arguments in England , 10-15 years ago that we must have uncontrolled immigration into Britain to help the economy , and what we now have is thousands of youngsters in England unemployed and priced out of the jobs market . <p> " Immigration can be a very good thing for the economy but it needs to be controlled . " <p> Prof Boswell says there is much research to show that immigrants do not create high unemployment and generally do not create a high burden on the welfare state . <p> However , she says : " Immigration is often used as a lightning rod for channelling a lot of anxieties about employment , about welfare , about social cohesion . " <p> Prof Boswell adds : " It is much easier to sell the benefits of labour migration where an economy is facing very tangible acute shortages in particular sectors or regions . <p> " It is much easier as well to sell labour migration when it is about recruiting highly-skilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult for governments to make a case or sell the case for recruiting semi or low-skilled migrants . <p> " If it were to become a major issue of concern , for example with Romanian or Bulgarian immigration , then I would expect the SNP to water down its claims about a more liberal immigration policy , at least not to emphasise those in the election campaign because it clearly would not be a vote-winner.

@@2290236 <h> Popular Festivals <p> Clash has had a rethink regarding how it scores its album reviews -- and our new guide to what the whatever-out-of-10 mark that accompanies each article can be read here . 2014 is a big year for Clash -- it sees us turn 10 , and reach issue 100 of our magazine . It sees us further our reach into the digital market with our award-winning app , and develop this website that you 're looking at right now . <p> In many ways , it 's time to grow up -- or , rather , to show the industry just how much we 've grown already . Clash has perhaps been seen as small fry in the past , compared to longer-standing magazines sharing shelf space , naming no names . But the progression that we 've made of late has been incredible -- what other magazine has Elton John on board as guest editor , for one thing ? The magazine looks and feels incredible -- nobody can deny that . 2014 is going to be big , mark these words . This website is going from strength to strength , too , with big-name exclusives published regularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's because of this confidence in Clash 's marketplace position , in the value it offers readers as a multi-platform brand covering everything from breaking news to our own promoted events , that we 're happy to look at our own reviews section and make changes . Too many 8/10 scores in a single issue can be confusing -- how are you , the reader , supposed to really know what is a brilliant album and what 's just a bit better than the one the band in question put out before ? It 's time to shake things up and make the higher-scoring LPs stand out -- which is what we 're doing from issue 93 ( April 2014 ) . <p> As part of this rethink , we 've asked a handful of respected critics for their thoughts on scoring albums -- and in some cases , not scoring them at all . As the numerical mark at the end of a review 's copy can often serve , to the reader , as reductive shorthand , rendering what comes above it needless . Or does it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if anyone bothers to read a three- or four-star review of a band they 've never heard of , " says the Guardian 's head pop and rock critic , Alexis Petridis . And his point is one that Clash 's repositioning of its scoring structure hopes to address : that too many high scores in too short a space of time can stunt the chances of exploration . Personally , I can remember checking out a good few LPs based on the combination of high ratings and the reviewer recommending them . Nowadays , I do n't think that regular readers of NME , Q or Kerrang ! have that same connection with a writer . Opinions expressed are those of the publication , of course , not the individual , whatever the argument of an editor otherwise . Metacritic does n't divide by scribe -- it breaks down by brand . <p> And it 's review aggregator sites that are driving scores in attention-seekingly disparate directions -- rate an album highly and your review will appear at the top of Metacritic 's pages . Score it appallingly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while also representing a red rag to the bullish fanbase of whoever the act in question is . Land on Metacritic 's main page for Beady Eye 's ' BE ' LP of 2013 ( link ) , and you 'll see a bunch of average marks for an average album . Clash 's is at the top as the most positive -- look , we 're changing the system , okay ? -- but down below is a shockingly red 0/10 , slapped on the Dave Sitek-produced set by Drowned In Sound . <p> " I think the review argued the case for the 0/10 score , " says DiS editor Sean Adams . " It was by a young writer perhaps trying to make a name for himself , who grew up as a music fan in a time when Oasis were the biggest band in the world , who writes for a site that loves TV On The Radio , being offered the chance to review a record that on almost every level was abysmal . The review was n't meant to be serious -- but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of those moments that has made me rethink our editorial process . " <p> So trashing an album by a popular band is n't just clickbait tactics , then ? Not for Adams : " I woke up to an utter shitstorm ( when that review had run ) . Some reactions were really aggressive -- so much so you 'd have thought I 'd just come out as a Tory . I was taken aback by the reaction from people who believed this was something desperate that we had considered doing as a way to drive up traffic . But in fact we got more traffic from a thread full of fish puns ( on the social board ) than that review -- and getting a few cheap clicks is n't a priority for us when we get millions of page views a month without needing to lower ourselves . " <p> Low scores can be attractive reads , though , as Luke Turner , associate editor at The Quietus , explains : " I 'm always going to be more interested in a 1/10 review than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doran : " Looking at the situation from the outside , if I were buying albums based on scores I 'd need to see a clutch of 9s and 10s across the board . Face it , when any of us see a 5/10 we automatically think ' dogshit ' , not ' average ' . This trend is only following in the wake of what happened in computer games criticism in the ' 80s , where scores essentially started at 7 and peaked at 10 . " <p> But scoring in the videogames market is hugely scrutinised today . Look at the perfect 10 IGN awarded the game Uncharted 3 : Drake 's Deception ( link ) -- and then look at the comments below . " This review proofs that there 's no such thing as independed game journalists , magazines or sites ... the revieu is even more ridiculous than the game ... " The typos are the original poster 's own , so furious were they that they could n't use a QWERTY keyboard properly . <p> Ben Maxwell reviews games for Edge , and says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an 8/10 of 10 years ago , due to the exponential improvement in technology and coding trickery . In music , while there is technological progression in the quality of production , the margin between an album released in 2014 and one released in 1964 is much slimmer -- a good tune is a good tune , but a game with controls acceptable 30 years ago might not be as enjoyable today . Personally , I tend to ignore the number on music reviews and focus on the writers who I feel do a good job of conveying a sense of the music , and who make meaningful comparisons . " <p> Turner echoes the sentiment : " I 've never bought a record based on a score -- I think that 's quite weird . I 'd always go with the writer , and if it 's something like Q or NME bigging up a Muse album , I do n't believe it because that 's what they do . I follow writer by-lines and personal recommendations , and that 's about it . " <p> All of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says : " Really , it would be better all round if everyone ditched scoring . But scoring is too useful to advertising and marketing departments . It 's really the money people and lazy readers who are being serviced by scores . " It 's worth noting here that The Quietus does not score its album reviews . <p> Stevie Chick , a freelance critic of no little repute ( for MOJO , the Guardian , the BBC , NME ) , author and all-round good egg , agrees with Doran . " I think number grades on album reviews are a really bad idea . They encourage laziness on the part of the reader -- they encourage the reader to see ( critics ) solely as Consumer Guides . They reduce the review to a simple , binary ' should I buy this or not ? ' I 've come to believe that your typical reader is unlikely to be convinced to buy something we rate as 6/10 -- even though many records that I think are worth a punt end up reading like 6/10 reviews . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading the actual reviews ? " <p> Doran 's point regarding scored reviews being of most interest to marketing departments is certainly one evidenced by posters proudly bearing four-star ratings -- often without any qualifying quotes to back them up . " You see a lot of film and music posters with star ratings on them rather than quotes , do n't you ? " says Petridis . " I hate them , I think they 're totally reductive and false . Nobody other than a rock critic sits there listening to an album and thinks , ' Oh , I 'd rate this as four out of five . ' But I suppose that is useful to advertisers . " <p> Adams does n't quite see scores in such a negative light . " I think scores can help focus the mind of the writer , as well as making things easier to consume for a reader . I 've always flicked through magazines , and now I find myself skimming through other websites in search of something intriguing to read , and scores can be something that helps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , the scores are useful for Wikipedia , Metacritic and aggregators like that , which generate traffic , so I ca n't really see much harm in them . " <p> So if scores are so important to traffic -- clickbait-style zeroes aside -- why does n't The Quietus grade its reviews itself ? ( Scores are assigned to its reviews on Metacritic and Any Decent Music . ) Explains Doran : " It was born out of sheer bloody mindedness . From the start we insisted on doing the opposite of what we were told we ' had ' to do by web guru consensus . So just as we went long-form , before that was a ' thing ' , we discarded scoring . <p> " I think we only regretted it for a couple of weeks , early on , when we thought we 'd be ignored by Metacritic . But we 've never thought about reintroducing them . And luckily it helped us slough off the irritating tl ; dr crew early doors . We wanted to make lazy readers with short attention spans as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who are n't like us . I 'm not saying we 're right and they 're wrong , but we wanted to make a website that we 'd want to read . " <p> The core concern that has driven Clash to rethink its scoring strategy was that too many reviews " indicating universal acclaim " , to refer to Metacritic 's 81/100-plus category , were reaching the magazine . Does n't it make a minefield for readers , who struggle to identify which new band is the best of that month 's bunch ? <p> " I think a slew of 4/5 , or 8/10 reviews in a magazine reads white , " says Petridis . " I think it would be interesting to see what the reaction would be if a magazine adopted a tighter scoring system across the board . I 've no idea how PRs would take it , though . " I guess we 'll find out when the April issue of Clash is published . And it could be much worse -- Pitchfork 's rating system , like IGN 's has been previously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " These marks have pretensions to scientific method , which is utterly preposterous . There is n't a single person who has ever worked there who can explain what the different between 8.3 and 8.4 for an indie rock album is , even if their lives depended on it . " <p> Personal opinions on the pros and cons of scoring aside , though , it 's generally recognised that rating records is a necessary part of the process -- even if out-of-10s are assigned by an independent aggregator rather than hosted on the original site . So what actually qualifies as a 10/10 album ? Is it even possible to award maximum marks to a new release , without seeing how one 's connection to it changes over time ? Most reviewers only spend a few days with an album before covering it -- and sometimes , as private playbacks and limited-repeat streams become annoyingly commonplace , not even that much time is available . <p> " If it was up to me , I 'd be more generous with my 10/10s , " says Chick . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critic , so much as being a filter , someone questing to find good stuff , stuff to celebrate , stuff to revel in . I 'm less interested in telling you that the new Oasis album is predictable garbage . Hindsight helps , but I 'd argue it 's a moveable feast -- my opinions on record change and evolve in time , but the only aim for a review is to be right for that moment in time . We ca n't manufacture hindsight , we can only be honest in the moment . <p> " I 'd say the East India Youth album , ' Total Strife Forever ' ( Clash review ) was deserving of 10/10 , although I only gave it 4/5 in MOJO . I did n't really push it at the time , but it 's a record that has really touched me , which I 've played incessantly since receiving -- and , indeed , since reviewing , which is n't always the case . It 's an album I want to listen to again , just moments after it 's finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really good year for music , the best in ages , " says Petridis , " and I gave quite a few 5/5 reviews . Most recently I gave 5/5 to the reissue of Run The Jewels ( Clash review ) . But it 's a good point about how you feel about an album changing after you 've lived with it a while . Ultimately , all reviews are more or less based on snap judgements . There are albums I really love , that took me six months to get into . You 're never going to be able to replicate that as a critic . <p> " That said , I think listeners are more inclined to make snap judgements about music these days , just because of the sheer amount of it that 's available to them . We live in a Spotify and YouTube and illegal downloads world -- the way I grew up with music , as a teenager , was that you could probably afford one album a month , and that was it . You had to try to get on with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks . That does n't apply anymore . " <p> Doran recalls two big 10/10 albums from when he first became a music writer . " It 's probably ' White Blood Cells ' by The White Stripes , or ' Turn On The Bright Lights ' by Interpol -- both good records which I no longer listen to , but which will always have a place on my shelves . Actually , the last album I gave 10/10 to was ' Monoliths &amp; Dimensions ' by SunnO ) ) ) , in 2009 , for Drowned In Sound ( link ) . This is a decision I 'm perfectly happy with . In fact , it now ranks in my top 10 albums ever . " <p> Adams names The Antlers ' ' Burst Apart ' and Sharon Van Etten 's ' Tramp ' as personal recent perfection : " Both sucked me into their somewhat gloomy caverns , filled me with emotions and shot me out feeling slightly different every time ... They both glisten and ache , in the best possible way . " But does a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a writer , a reviewer , really know the grade at the article 's end ahead of reading back their own words ? <p> " I usually find the process of committing my thoughts to the page and setting up an argument for or against a record informs the final score , " says Adams . " But I usually have a vague idea if it 's a 2/10 or an 8/10 following so many listens to an album . " Petridis works to a comparable pattern : " I have an idea of what I 'm going to give an album when I listen to it , but it tends to be formalised at the end . What does the review read like ? Does it seem like a three-star review , or a four-star review ? I kind of hope that the review leads the score , rather than the other way round , if that makes sense . " Says Chick : " The number is n't set until I 've finished reviewing . I 'll have an inkling , but anything can change until the review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've come back around to where we began : does the review matter , ultimately , when there 's a score on the piece ? According to these prominent critics : yes , as without the writing process the score ca n't be fully realised . Newer reviewers can seem overly eager to award high marks , but that 's part of evolving as a voice worth the reader 's attention -- the more you write , the more context you gain , and the easier it becomes to really distinguish a 6/10 from a 7/10 . Proper editorial guidelines help , but ultimately it 's the writer 's own ever-changing moods that most inform the mark handed to any release -- the mark subsequently passed to marketing for public-facing promotion . <p> " I like to say , ' Look over here , there 's something amazing , you might like it ! ' says Chick . " But that 's just how I like to roll . " Perhaps we should all go tumbling after , more often than current scoring etiquette allows us to . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ review ratings come into effect for the April 2014 issue ( issue 93 ) .

Before taking the post as the permanent observer of the Holy See to the U.N. , Archbishop Francis A. Chullikatt served as apostolic nuncio to Iraq and Jordan and lived in Baghdad from 2006 to 2010 . <p> The archbishop said : " This tragedy is all the more egregious when one pauses to consider that these men and women of faith ... have been living at peace with their neighbors for untold generations . " <p> The persecution of Christians in Iraq has increased in the wake of the country 's democratic transition . There and elsewhere religious minorities had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order enforced by previous rulers . Archbishop Chullikatt said that today , " because of the conflict , Christians are caught in the crossfire . " <p> He denounced the emerging " tradition " of bombing Catholic and other Christian churches on Christmas Eve , which has happened in the Middle East for several years . <p> When Smith asked Archbishop Chullikatt about the effect of persecution on children , the archbishop indicated that the damage is immense . " They live in fear ... they go to schools , not even sure they will come back safe and alive . " <p> The archbishop also expressed concern for the future . " This is the kind of formation we are giving to the young generations who will become leaders , " he said . " It is a painful thing . " <p> The persecution of Christians is not limited to those living in the Middle East .

Other speakers at the hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nigeria , Myanmar , Sudan , and Eritrea , among others .

" The typical Christian in today 's world is not an affluent American male pulling up to church in a Lincoln Continental ; it 's a poor black woman and mother of four in Botswana .

While Abrams clarified that sanctions are " a last resort , " and should not be used in every instance , " some form of economic sanction will get the message home . " <p> Another problem raised at the hearing is that the U.S. has not appointed a new ambassador at large for international religious freedoms , the State Department post established by the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 .

Could not subscribe , try again later <p> Female workers are more likely to be paid below the living wage than men <p> Almost a quarter of workers in the West Midlands are n't paid enough to live on , according to a hard-hitting new study chaired by the former Bishop of Birmingham . <p> The employment market is " polarising " with high paid jobs and low paid jobs both increasing -- while the number of middle income jobs shrinks . <p> Workers on lower salaries have suffered seen their wages fall in real terms since 2005 . <p> At the same time , the cost of necessities such as food and fuel have shot up much faster than the official rate of inflation , leaving many working people struggling to make ends meet . <p> The grim warning was presented by the Living Wage Commission , an independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York and former Bishop of Birmingham , and backed by the TUC , Chambers of Commerce and voluntary groups . <p> He said : " Archbishop Sentamu has done a huge service to everybody in his analysis . What we now need is a period of facts-based analysis on the impact of the living wage . <p> " But in principle I think that it 's an important part of what we are about , to elevate the condition of the 4.6 million people who live below the living wage level . " <p> Dr Sentamu said more employers should adopt the policy , and he argued that paying higher wages would save the Treasury money because it would cut the benefits bill . <p> He said : " For the first time the majority of people in poverty are actually in paid employment . The nature of poverty in Britain is changing . <p> " The idea of ' making work pay ' increasingly sounds like an empty slogan to the millions of people who are hard-pressed and working hard , often in two or three jobs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole of the UK picks up the bill in tax credits , in-work benefits and decreased demand in the economy . " <p> Dr Sentamu added : " We know that not every employer could afford to implement a living wage right now . Yet we also know there are definitely employers that are able to pay a living wage but choose not to . " <p> Champagne for some , but bar staff and waiters are most likely to be underpaid <p> The jobs where you are most likely to be paid below the living wage are bar man or waiter . According to the report , 85 per cent of people in these roles are underpaid . <p> Other jobs with a high proportion of workers below the living wage include catering assistant , vehicle cleaner , dry cleaning assistant , shop assistant , cleaner , hairdresser and florist . <p> The report warns that low pay is closely linked with unhealthy diets . A Government study in 2012 found that the poorest households were only able to buy 2.7 portions of fresh fruit and vegetables a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerably lower than the average of four portions a day . <p> And it warns that official inflation figures give a partial picture of the rise in the cost of living . <p> The cost of food has risen by 44 per cent between 2005 and 2013 while the cost of household fuel rose by 110 per cent . <p> But the consumer price index ( CPI ) , the official inflation measure , is only 26 per cent for that period . This is because CPI measures the variation in the price of a range of goods , including products such as televisions -- which have actually got cheaper -- and does n't necessarily reflect changes in the cost of basic essentials . <p> What 's more , people on low incomes may actually find themselves paying more than others . Energy customers paying by prepayment meters pay ? 138 a year more than those paying by direct debit , for example . <p> Wages had traditionally risen as the economy grew , the report said , but this began to change around 2005 , even before the banking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crash , as workers accepted pay freezes or below-inflation increases in the belief that this made it more likely they would keep their jobs . The study warns : " For thousands of low paid workers , low pay is a permanent state , rather than the first rung on the pay ladder . " <p> Women are more affected than men . Auditors KPMG found 27 per cent of female employees nationwide are paid below the living wage , compared to 16 per cent of male employees . At the same time , the workforce is becoming increasingly polarised , with more high paying and low paying jobs created while the number of middle-income jobs fell . <p> Citing an inquiry by think tank the Resolution Foundation , the report states : " Not only were the numbers of jobs in the middle section of the income distribution declining with increasing numbers of jobs either side , but there was also rapid growth in low pay sectors such as hotels and restaurants , and high pay sectors such as financial services . " <p> TUC general secretary Frances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovery mode , but most people 's pay packets have yet to experience a similar revival . <p> " For those families firmly stuck in low-pay Britain , life is tough , and they continue to struggle to make their wages stretch far enough to meet the cost of food , fuel and other essentials . <p> " Low pay is blighting the prospects of millions of workers , and we need urgent action to tackle the UK 's serious , and worsening , low-pay problem . One way of easing the financial pressures on low-paid families would be for more employers to pay the living wage . " <p> John Longworth , director general of the British Chambers of Commerce , said : " Making ends meet is clearly an issue of huge concern to many in Britain today , and we applaud all of those businesses that pay , or aspire to pay , their staff above the living wage .

Last week we asked our readers to nominate their secret social enterprise crushes for the chance to win a Divine Chocolate goody bag .

If we have n't featured your letter , but you 'd like to give someone an extra-special mention this Valentine 's Day , please do so by dropping us a line in the comments below . <p> My secret social enterprise-inspired Valentine ? Well that would have to be Kelly Klein , the CEO and founder of student-staffed tech support company Student@Home . She first caught my eye when I learned of her background as a private banker -- that 's two traditionally male-dominated sectors that 's she 's made her mark in . <p> The work she is pioneering at Student@Home is helping hundreds of homes and small businesses across London to get online , through partnerships with universities and housing associations across London ( and soon beyond ) . This is inspiring to say the least . <p> Not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work and experience but small business and individuals are benefiting from a cost-efficient computer support service . Basically , if Kelly and her team can support my nan in getting set up online and make her feel part of a community then this has to be the woman of my dreams ! <p> I work for a charity called Emmaus . We help formerly homeless people by giving them a place to live and work in our social enterprises across the UK . One of the guys at our Cambridge community used to be a heroin addict , and by his own admission spent a lot of his life wasting time . Now he 's a deputy community leader . He led a project to teach people how to pack 40-foot containers full of goods to send to poor communities overseas . He is learning to drive , even though it scares the life out of him , and he heads up the Emmaus Cambridge five-a-side football team . He also came out with me recently when we had to pitch for a corporate partnership in a legal firm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If talking about his past unsettled him , then he did a great job of hiding it . His candour and appreciation of Emmaus , and what our social enterprise charity had done for him , meant that we won the firm 's support . <p> I 've got a professional crush on GoodGym founder Ivo Gormley . I am lucky enough to work for an organisation that supports GoodGym , which is a social enterprise with a mission to get people to get fit by focusing on people and places rather than pounding an indoor treadmill . <p> Not only does GoodGym 's inherent message speak to my heart ( and my much-to-be-desired post-baby body ) , but the reframing of exercise as a force for good sings to my mind .

The venture failed but he did n't give up , he went on to co-found The Bike Shed Theatre which is a cafe-bar and theatre here in Exeter that supports local actors and scriptwriters and shows a great variety of plays , including stories with a social conscience . <p> Fin is a real inspiration of many of us in the southwest , but his work has never really been recognised formally .

I have only met him once and then only for about 15 minutes but he impressed and inspired me mainly for two reasons . Firstly , because it is a brilliant idea that challenges the status quo of the educational establishments , the value of traditional routes to start-up , and even co-working ( itself challenging the status quo ) and because it is democratising in giving access and support to young people early in their start-up journeys . Secondly , and more personally , I found him inspiring because of his energy , passion , attitude - he did n't sit around thinking and planning for months and years about what he would do if he could , or spend forever trying to get funding and support ; he just took an opportunity and ran with it . He is open and honest ( or seemed so ! ) about the risks , challenges , chances of success , and shows no arrogance about what is the best way to do things or why his way is better - he just wants to get on with it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone who works in and has founded two social enterprises myself , I see daily how easy it is , even in this apparently innovative , brave , different sector , to get stuck chasing funding , and getting bogged down in governance etc .

Please click here if you wish to continue . <p> Game Of Thrones ' Jaime Lannister did n't have the easiest of times during series three , did he ? Stuck on the road with female guard and sparring partner Brienne , he spent most of it filthy , handcuffed and being pushed around before losing a rather vital body part in a scene not for the faint-hearted ... <p> That being said , his hardships - and relationship with Brienne - did allow viewers to see a different side to the Kingslayer , played by actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau . <p> " Jaime is a great character to play . I like the fact he 's so conflicted and has all these secrets , " said Nikolaj at a recent cast junket in London . <p> " It 's good writing . He seems like a whole human so there are always things you can identity with . I think most of us dislike when people jump to conclusions about who you are . Sometimes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you in a part and presume you 're that role . I sometimes get , ' Hi Jaime , how 's your sister ? ! ' That happens for Jaime on a huge scale as he is known as the Kingslayer . " <p> Here 's what else Nikolaj said at the junket - warning , spoilers ahead ! <p> On that scene where he lost his hand <p> " Noah Taylor , who played Locke , was so scary . The night we shot that scene I was sick which was actually very perfect . I felt really bad and he was acting very violent , as he should be . They built this huge knife , a version that he could whack down on me . Of course , he had to be very accurate -- and he was n't always ! That was good for my reaction . It did actually hurt because he went for it . There was another day we shot a scene after that where I fall off the horse and he beats me up . It was so muddy and he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous but you have to be specific about the kick . Because it was so muddy and we were rolling around , he missed and hit my rib , which took a month to get over . They had to reshoot it three times as Gwen ( who plays Brienne ) was laughing . " <p> On the obstacles he faces now his character is without a hand <p> " As an actor obstacles are gifts . For a guy who is defined in many ways by his ability with a sword , to lose that part of him is a huge obstacle . The writing was so strong and so good that the scenes after that were a lot of fun to shoot . " <p> " It seems like a huge change and there are obviously some changes in him , but I think it 's all about point of view . If you 're told before the scene in episode one where he 's having sex with Cersei and pushes Bran out of the window , that , yes , it 's his sister but it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's horrible but it 's a romantic love -- and there 's a horrible , evil boy climbing the wall . If that horrible boy tells anyone what he saw they 'll have to kill Cersei 's children and she would die and he would probably die , it would be a different scenario . You might think differently . <p> " He does something because he 's about loyalty and family and protecting the people he loves . That goes through to what happens with Brienne , I think . The fact he meets this woman is huge for him as he 's forced to spend so much time with her . For the first time , I think , he does something for someone outside his family and risks everything for this woman . <p> " I think the biggest change is the fact he loses his identify in many ways and has to reevaluate and rediscover himself . That goes back to the scene with Brienne in the bath where he reveals this huge secret that he 's carried since he was sixteen . He tells , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have connected and he sees himself in her . The big question , of course , is what happens when he gets back to King 's Landing ? That 's where we 'll find out what has changed . At the end of season three something has changed but he does n't know what it is . I think he surprised himself and does n't really know why he went back and rescued Brienne from the bear pit . " On the show 's directors " They work differently and that 's what 's very inspiring both for us as the actors but also for the crew . I think what the producers have been very good at is finding the directors that really love the show and have a huge passion for it . Sometimes actors think we work hard but on a show like this it 's really directors as they are booked for six months solid because of how they film the show in different locations .

It was a very difficult episode because it 's such a huge part of the story . Of course , there are variations from the book to the show , but for me the execution was great . Even when you 're on the show you say , ' How the hell did they do this ? ' It is a television show and even if you have a huge budget it 's still limited . The scripts are brilliant but the directing is amazing . David Nutter did that one and it was just brilliant . <p> On whether he worries he will die before the last episode <p> " It 's great to be part of this series . I 'm so grateful and it 's wonderful but it 's also a television show and another job - a fantastic job but it will end one day . I 'd love to be part of the show until the end , I love working with these people -- they 're amazing -- but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> On what season four has in store <p> " I think for Jaime it will be the fact the Lannister family is together for the first time on the show .

Fortunately , it was n't and like the rest of this series it was hilarious -- and another case of Outnumbered embracing its future . <p> Last week I observed the young Australian 's penchant for dishing out bad advice to the Brockman offspring , wearing revealing clothing and walking in at inappropriate times . The Gap Year had Stacey 's tendencies turned up to eleven and the results were hilarious , climaxing in a very amusing scene when the goddaughter saunters in just when Sue is trying to persuade Jake not to take a gap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borrowing ' Stacey , the latter continually giving improper pointers and of course , Jake 's decision over taking a gap year . <p> The title of each episode of Outnumbered usually reflects the events of that week but The Gap Year seems ill-fitting with Pete and Ben 's country expedition in the frame . If the title had been , say , The Camping Trip then we would have had more focus on their outing but because of Jake 's parallel plot it felt we did n't get quite enough of either storyline . There was lots of juicy jokes simply waiting to be touched upon with Ben and Pete 's excursion ( see series four 's The Labrador when a solo Ben went on an adventure holiday ) but it felt rather undercooked . The dogging provoked a mild titter from me as did the pre-teen 's elaborate traps but if that plot strand had n't had to share the limelight it could have been extremely amusing . Moreover , Jake 's university/gap year choice was n't especially engrossing and somewhat dragged out . Still , this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thoughtful and thoroughly likeable . <p> Sue has always been a worrier , one to take fright unnecessarily and nibble at her fingernails over minor issues but her behaviour towards Stacey this episode was borderline rude . The scene in front of the television displayed Pete 's godchild 's relatively low intellect so she was n't to know that a lot of the stuff she was saying was inappropriate ( although pulling out her G-string to show Ben just took the biscuit ) . Sue 's attempts to send her to Stoke ( " party capital of Europe " almost had me in tears ) and her final triumph when she bundled Stacey off to Edinburgh were a bit unfair . Yes , she was n't the best influence but she was well meaning ( " you do n't want her being a little fatty " ) . However , the fact she 's still in the UK suggests this might not the last we 've seen of Pete 's ditzy goddaughter . <p> Kids-wise , each of the Brockman youngsters ' ' new ' characteristics have cemented . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls ( I 'm looking at those condoms Ben used to filter stream water ) and his driving test .

' anecdotes , which have a limited life-span . Sue and Pete are still overwrought and cynical but fundamentally loveable . And Karen remains extraordinarily perceptive but this estranges her from her own youthful society , something this week did n't look at so much . <p> The Gap Year was a bit of a missed opportunity in some ways but it was still funny .

Here 's Caroline 's review of its first episode ... <p> This review contains spoilers . <p> 1.1 Pilot <p> There are good shows and bad shows , but there are also shows that surpass expectations and shows that fall woefully short of potential . Unfortunately , though The CW 's latest stab at supernatural high school romance , Star-Crossed , has every chance of being the next Vampire Diaries or Reign and actually developing into something worth watching week to week , the premiere episode belongs in the latter category . There are a lot of great ideas , competent young actors and a pleasing dollop of daring in the show 's first hour but then , despite this , all of the good things have to fight to get noticed over the bad . <p> So , getting the disappointing stuff out of the way first , Star-Crossed is by its very nature a dated high school show , with a compilation of actors from other series just to draw attention to this fact . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jow from Vampire Diaries , Matt Lanter from 90210 , Grey Damon from everything and a whole host of other guest stars/recurring characters who are noticeably recognisable for anyone who 's been paying attention to the US teen drama scene over the last few years . That would n't be a drawback , but I think the show has ambitions above and beyond this target audience . <p> The CW has crafted an entire business model around the popularity of supernatural romance shows , but Star-Crossed , in all its efforts to say something important/new , fails to step out from the shadow of previous series like Roswell , with which it bears much resemblance . It 's one of those shows that always appear at the tail-end of a trend , like everything that followed Lost , but fails to move the genre forward any further . Does anyone actually want or need another Romeo and Juliet-with-a-twist stories that inevitable develops into an ever-revolving love triangle that happens to include an alien ? I 'm the ultimate CW apologist , and I 'm not even sure I do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also has a lot going for it . As with the previously mentioned Reign , there are new ways to present the aged high school soap if a few tweaks are made , and propelling the action ten years into the future is an effective way of doing so . The futuristic flourishes are subtle enough to please sci-fi geeks without becoming a distraction and the extent of technological and societal changes has obviously been worked out beforehand ( that might sound like faint praise , but not when so many shows do n't even seem to bother ) , and the idea of a group of alien teenagers , the Atrian Seven , being integrated into the school system with other , unwelcoming , kids obviously has shades of American history , also . <p> The story is relatively simple -- an alien race has crash landed on earth and humans have attempted to deal with the new arrivals in the best way they know how -- control , strict laws and segregation .

The love story is obviously coming , given that both of them are outsiders ( Emery has spent the last four years in hospital with a vague , yet-to-be-explained disorder ) and , you know , ' star-crossed ' , and cool kid Grayson provides the third point to their developing triangle . <p> As an exploration of fraught race relations in America , Star-Crossed has good intentions but emerges pretty toothless in practice . People have been critical of the show for its old-fashioned perspective and shaky character introductions , but experience has taught us all to give shows like this more of a chance . It all hinges on how much focus the love triangle gets over the admittedly intriguing genre stuff but I , for one , have hopes for the future after the final twist . <p> There are things that could well start to bring the stronger elements of the show to the fore , and this premiere should have enough promise to keep open-minded sci-fi fans and teen drama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ premiere was n't perfect , but it was n't bad either , and we 'll have to wait and see whether Star-Crossed has bitten off more than it can chew with big ideas and sci-fi concepts , or whether it can improve on itself in the coming weeks .

Or were there more political intentions than one might think ? <p> In the new Channel 5 series Henry and Anne : The Lovers Who Changed History historian Dr Suzannah Lipscomb delves into the world of possibly the most fascinating and contested royal relationship that our monarchy has ever seen -- this being the courtship of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn . <p> In this two-part series , Dr Lipscomb will explore how this King fell so fiercely in love with a lady at court , and how this led to him going to such drastic extents to marry her . We are all too aware of the events that came about from this romance , including Henry VIII breaking with the Roman Catholic Church and the papacy , becoming the Head of the Church of England , and divorcing his devoted wife of around twenty years , Catherine of Aragon . However , in this series , Suzannah will investigate the background of these events in an attempt to unpick what political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history forever . The question is , was it simply love , sheer devotion and infatuation between Henry and Anne which influenced the events leading to their marriage ? Or are there more underlining factors that we have not yet considered ? And , for such a notably impatient King , what made Henry drive towards these changes for so many years ? <p> In this first episode , Dr Lipscomb will begin her research at Hever Castle in Kent , which was Anne 's childhood home . It is here that Suzannah comes across a copy of the religious volume Book of Hours , which holds an example of Anne 's writing . Within it , she inscribed a notable phrase : " The Time Will Come " . This could be an interesting piece of evidence towards revealing Anne 's strategic and advantageous ambitions from such a young age . <p> Dr Lipscomb then follows Anne 's path to Ch ? teau de Blois in France , where she was made a lady-in-waiting to the French Queen . It was here that Anne learned the fashionable French customs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present her wit , intelligence and refined manners to other members and visitors of the Royal court , one visitor being none other than Leonardo da Vinci . Alongside this , she also learned how to hone other courtly skills , such as dancing and singing . <p> After some time in France , Anne made her first appearance at the English court and met the King at a royal banquet . But was it after this first meeting that Anne became so determined to attract the King and keep his favour ? Or was it Henry 's constant pursing of Anne which led to their notorious relationship , this meaning she was not as ambitious as some may think ? This documentary explores the possible answers to these questions . In relation to the last point , in the first episode , Suzannah discusses with Tom Betteridge at Hampton Court about how chivalry worked within Henry 's court circles , analyising how quickly notions of love and desire could erupt into motivated sexual advances amongst the young courtiers at the time . <p> As their relationship developed , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lipscomb exposes a love-sick king who wished with all his might for Anne to break her promise and become his mistress . Suzannah also looks at a number of gifts sent between the couple during their courtship , and also witnesses the Biblical messages that Anne sent to Henry relating to her providing him with a male heir -- something which he desperately strove towards as his reign progressed . <p> It is through visits to the buildings which are now defined by the history of this Royal couple , alongside rich theatrical reconstructions , that Suzannah will bring viewers into the sphere of this enthralling and volatile relationship which changed British history . <p> The first episode of this series will be broadcast on Channel 5 at 8pm on Thursday 20th February , and will be repeated on Channel 5+24 on Friday 21st February at 8pm.

@@2311239 @ Ulster director of rugby Humphreys has crucial role when it comes to bringing in new talent <h> Niall Crozier <p> Recent recruit : Ruaidhri Murphy is leaving the Brumbles to play for Ulster <p> IT is worth noting the words of Ruaidhri Murphy , Ulster 's latest recruit . The 26-year-old , who will be arriving at Ravenhill from the Brumbies in August , highlighted the part played by Ulster director of rugby , David Humphreys , in persuading him to enlist . <p> The in-coming loose-head concluded that Humphreys " has huge ambition and big aims for the team " . <p> Murphy added : " That is exciting and I hope that I can play a part in bringing those aims to reality . " <p> We have become accustomed to statements like that . In recent years , Ulster 's world-class scrum-half , Ruan Pienaar , former Springboks captain Johann Muller and 2009 World Cup-winning All Blacks tight-head John Afoa in turn have pointed to the Humphreys Factor in persuading them that moving from south of the equator to Belfast was a good idea . <p> So while we may have become accustomed to such statements , hopefully that familiarity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight of the fact that Humphreys goes to the negotiating table with four things weighing heavily in his favour . <p> Firstly , he is respected in world rugby as a player who performed on the pitch and who , since retiring , has been successful in transferring his spheres of influence to the recruitment/management arena . <p> Thirdly , he is able to identify a target and , having done that , he does his homework thoroughly to ensure that he is pursuing a player who is going to solve rather than create problems for him . Only then does he make his move . <p> Fourthly , when he sits down to talk to that player , he manages to make him see and believe that Humphreys regards him as a vital cog in the machine he is building . <p> His record as a recruiting sergeant is highly impressive . Not only has he signed players who contribute enormously on the pitch ; those he has brought on board also have been huge influences for good on the training ground and away from rugby altogether . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than greedy takers , in terms of their willingness to share their expertise and time with others in the squad and in the wider community . <p> In bringing Dubliner Murphy back to Ireland from Australia , Humphreys is right in step with the policy of having Irish players based in Ireland and protected by the IRFU 's welfare and time-management programme rather than plying their trade elsewhere on an overseas club 's terms . <p> Thus it is that on Humphreys ' watch we have seen Tommy Bowe and Roger Wilson return to Belfast from Ospreys and Northampton Saints respectively , while in the past few weeks Sean O'Brien , Jamie Heaslip and Dave Kearney have extended their Leinster contracts , Paul O'Connell and Conor Murray have re-committed themselves to Munster and Rory Best has re-aligned himself with Ulster . <p> Thus , despite earlier fears of an exodus , Jonny Sexton is the only big-name player to have left Ireland , in his case to try his luck in France . <p> In addition to everything the IRFU have managed to do in persuading their best players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have played a part in the process , for the demands made of the former Leinster out-half appear to have persuaded any who may have been tempted to try the green fields of France not to bother . The other man 's grass is not always as green as sometimes looks to be the case when viewed through the fence . <p> Here in Ireland we do not have any vast reserve of rugby players . The number of adults playing rugby in England is put at 172,000 . In South Africa there are 118,000 . In France , adult players number 116,000 . In Ireland the figure is 28,000 -- the same as New Zealand , who are world champions . In the circumstances , it is essential that we take good care of our small band of professionals . <p> So Ruaidhri Murphy has decided to return to Ireland . At Ulster he will be joining Irish-qualified South African Rob Herring and Australian Sean Doyle who is eligible for Ireland , too . Again , they are Humphreys ' recruits . <p> Ulster and Ireland are beneficiaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and bring him through . Do n't forget that this time next season , New Zealander Jared Payne will be playing for Ireland in the Six Nations . <p> When that happens , hopefully the gentlemen of Dublin will acknowledge just how good a job their man in the north is doing . <h> How to Complain <p> If you have a complaint about the editorial content of the Belfast Telegraph or Sunday Life then contact the Editor here .

@@2327232 <h> Why contextual voice could be the future of voice communications #MWC14 <h> Categories <p> Voice communication is gaining a reputation as being an outdated technology . Whether that 's right or wrong is open to debate , but when you 've got Facebook purchasing WhatsApp for $19bn , it 's always going to raise a few eyebrows . <p> But voice has been on a hugely transformative journey in the last 10 years alone . The growth and popularity of VoIP , with increasing numbers of consumers opting for free VoIP offerings , has forced operators to muck their hands and start over trying to recapture lost revenue . <p> In an engaging panel session at Mobile World Congress representatives from Ericsson , SK Telecom , Audience and SAP discussed the future of voice from the operator 's perspective -- and the response was optimistic , yet cautious . <p> One technology which quickly reared its head was VoLTE . Despite a relatively slow deployment , perfect voice quality is n't the be all and end all , according to SAP mobile services VP Russell Green . <p> " I think the emphasis on VoLTE focusing on quality ... for the large majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high level of quality . Sometimes pretty good is good enough , " he said , adding : " There are however a lot of apps , from an enterprise perspective , where this is absolutely critical . " <p> Peter Santos , CEO and president of voice and audio processing firm Audience , had a different view . " Endpoints generally , whether it 's a phone , or PC ... they 've been generally designed for the last 100 years of telephony , " he explained . " If we 're thinking about designing a richer experience , the system needs to be designed with that in mind . <p> " I think we 're going to see an emphasis place on system sound design to deliver these kinds of experiences , " he added . <p> But with voice over LTE , are customers being led down a legacy path by the carriers ? <p> Arun Bhikshesvaran , Ericsson CMO , argued : " If you go to an all-IP environment , Lync and Skype do n't work properly .

Taking that identity and making it available in all different types of contexts -- the browser , a television , a phone -- makes that very powerful . " <p> The Ericsson CMO used the example of conducting a transaction over the phone where a small amount of added context would give a vital boost . <p> " I get dragged down to the most fundamental form of communication , a voice call , " he said . " The ability to transfer context on one side eases the pain on the other side and provides a fantastic experience for me . " <p> This , Bhikshesvaran argues , is where VoLTE could be advantageous . " One immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in place that 's built on IP , build for multiple endpoints ... you combine it with WebRTC , and through different APIs transfer it into different contexts .

Whilst many applications would find this adequate , there is so much more that is possible by integrating the operation and configuration of sensors into the machine control platform . <p> Integrating sensors through a fieldbus platform achieves a high speed distributed data and high levels of accuracy . <p> The fieldbus-enabled N-Smart range has been developed using three technologies . The first , Giga Ray 2s , uses high efficiency light coupling for improved light transmission and reception performance . <p> The second , Smart Noise Reduction , is a light reception algorithm which improves the detection stability of the sensors , and lastly there is the N-Core processor , providing high speed and precision detection with 36 bit processing capacity . <p> The range includes fibre optic sensors , long distance diffuse and CMOS BGS laser sensors can be configured automatically from the machine controller itself . <h> Get Electronics Weekly every day <h> Comments <h> One comment <p> The Technology Strategy Board has launched ? 4.75m funding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and includes several topics relating to sensors .

@@2355235 <h> The Sixth Extinction : An Unnatural History by Elizabeth Kolbert , review <h> The havoc humans have wreaked on our fellow species may be our undoing <p> In the aftermath of the recent storms that have done so much to reshape the soft coast of southern England , I found a dead guillemot on the beach . It had died , like hundreds of others , from a combination of exhaustion , hunger and the unseen effects of pollution . As it lay there in the shingle , with its plump white belly and black back , stubby wings and leathery webbed feet , it resembled a northern penguin ; an exotic bit of flotsam washed ashore from some far ocean , rather than the English Channel . <p> In one of the most affecting chapters in her remarkable book , American journalist Elizabeth Kolbert brings us face to face with the guillemot 's long lost relative:the great auk . During its brief acquaintance with humans -- from the 16th century to the mid 19th -- the auk , the original " penguin " , was so numerous that large flocks thronged entire outcrops of Iceland and Newfoundland . <p> These flightless birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , providing meat and mattress stuffing . " You do not give yourself the trouble of killing them , " reported an English sailor , " but lay hold of one and pluck the best ... You then turn the poor penguin adrift , with his skin half naked and torn off , to perish at his leisure . " <p> The last hapless auk perished one June evening in 1844 , strangled by Icelandic hunters . It joined a long line of animals driven to extinction by man , a line that is getting longer than the queue for a secret concert by Prince . By the latest estimation , one third of reef corals , one third of freshwater molluscs , one third of sharks and rays , a fifth of all reptiles , a quarter of all mammals and a sixth of all birds will go the way of the auk this century . <p> Oddly enough , extinction is a relatively new concept as far as humans are concerned -- contemporaneous , ironically , with the Industrial Revolution that triggered our current period of global warming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturalist Georges Cuvier began to consider the provenance of fossilised megafaunas , wondering why these large beasts no longer stalked the Earth . By 1800 , Cuvier had assembled a " fossil zoo " of 23 species that had existed in " a world previous to ours " . <p> Such evidence of mass extinction was slow to find supporters . Even Darwin was equivocal : " As we do not see the cause , we invoke cataclysms to desolate the world ! " It was n't until the 1970s , when an American geologist , Walter Alvarez , found a narrow clay layer in the strata of an Italian hilltop , that the cause of the last great extinction was confirmed : a giant asteroid ended the Cretaceous period -- and killed three quarters of all known species . <p> " The worst day ever on planet Earth " also gave us our evolutionary chance . " The reason this book is being written by a hairy biped , rather than a scaly one , has more to do with dinosaurian misfortune than with any particular mammalian virtue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anthropocene , we apes have used our skills to wreak havoc , despite the fact that our " great works " will be reduced to a future sedimentary layer the thickness of a cigarette paper . <p> Kolbert is a witty , deft writer with an eye for vivid colour . She takes us from sun-blistered desert islands on the Great Barrier Reef to the sopping Peruvian jungle , where she joins her guides chewing coca leaves to sustain her Andean trudge . But her most urgent warning is about the condition of our oceans . <p> Since the advent of the Industrial Revolution , the carbon dioxide absorbed by the sea has increased by 30 per cent . The specific result of this is to prevent calcifiers -- animals from corals to bivalves , and even some plants -- from forming their structures , with disastrous effects for the marine food chain . The acidifying oceans mean that all coral reefs -- which support up to nine million other species -- will have dissolved within 50 years . Does that matter ? It depends on what value you place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the great whales , from Neanderthals to Hawaiian crows -- bears witness to our voracious dominion , and shows how we have sowed the seeds of our own destruction . Kolbert concludes with a quote from the ecologist Paul Ehrlich : " In pushing other species to extinction , humanity is busy sawing off the limb on which it perches . " Hers is a deadly message , delivered in elegant prose , and we ca n't afford to ignore it .

@@2358232 report on whole person care has now been published with the catchy title One Person , One Team , One System . Commissioned by the shadow health secretary , Andy Burnham , and led by former Department of Health director Sir John Oldham , the report has been eagerly grasped by Ed Miliband and looks set to form the basis of future Labour party health strategy . What lies in store ? <p> Much of the answer is a bundle of existing ideas . The well-established case for integrated care is rehearsed , along with familiar calls for person-centred care and better engagement with patients and the public . Self-care is to be encouraged , citizen engagement promoted , integrated teams established , information shared and patients allocated a " care co-ordinator " . We 've been here before with little track record of success , but Oldham does go further . In particular he proposes : <p> * A " new compact with citizens " -- an " independent national conversation " looking at the future of health and care , to be completed within a year of the general election* New provider outcomes-based approaches such as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for local decision* Extended primary care services to provide more support for people in the community and at home* A reformed " whole person payment system " to replace the current payment by results tariff that incentivises fragmentation <p> With these proposals , Oldham seems to be drawing heavily on recent reports from the King 's Fund , Nuffield Trust and others -- indeed their influence looms large throughout the report . Those expecting a more political approach might be disappointed by the technical tone of the review . <p> The task facing Oldham was to come up with a recipe for change that did not involve yet more structural upheaval . Accordingly he emphasises that " relationships and culture trump structures " , and laments the recent loss of knowledge and experience in the health and care system -- " a form of organisational dementia " as he puts it . Nevertheless he can not resist some tinkering with the current structures : <p> *NHS England should be renamed Care England " to reflect the needs of the majority of people using the health and care system " * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and CQC to merge -- a proposal also made in the Francis report* The strengthening of health and wellbeing boards to take on a stronger strategic role in local health and care systems <p> The warm welcome given to the report by Labour leader , Ed Miliband , is in some measure a rebuff to the ideas of the person behind the establishment of the Oldham commission , Andy Burnham . Two of Burnham 's key ideas -- putting local government in charge of healthcare commissioning and making NHS trusts the " preferred provider " -- are nowhere to be seen . Instead , Oldham puts his faith in health and wellbeing boards or , as he strangely puts it , " analogous local arrangements " . <p> The elevation of these largely invisible boards to such a pivotal position is intriguing , especially since they were only dreamed up as a coalition sop to the Liberal Democrats to compensate for the loss of their policy on elected board members on the old primary care trusts . We still know little about these boards , and most patients and members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Indeed , even Ed Miliband , in a recent speech , mistakenly referred to them as " independent bodies " . Far too much is riding on them as the custodians of what Oldham calls " the locality pound " . <p> Although turgidly technical for the most part , Oldham does acknowledge the incompatibility of collaboration and competition . He urges " considerations of care firmly before those of competition " and reiterates Burnham 's call for the repeal of the section 75 regulations on compulsory tendering . However , these are somewhat throwaway remarks towards the end of the report , with no exploration of what will be necessary for the NHS to elude the clutches of domestic and European competition law . <p> Oddly , for a report commissioned by a left-wing politician to inform a future Labour government , the Oldham report reads apolitically . Much of it is simply lifted from thinktank publications , and the support for the work from PwC and KPMG only seems to add to the impression of a somewhat " establishment " report . For all the talk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this report of how the NHS can become more accountable to local populations . <p> What are we left with ? A worthy report but one hardly likely to set political pulses racing in the run-up to the general election , and probably doing nothing to assuage the worries of those opposed to the Health and Social Care Act 2012 . Two cheers out of three -- at best -- for Sir John ?

A council spokesman said : " In five of our six catchment areas and for more than 99% of pupils , the catchment area system has done its job this year .

At present , there are enough secondary places city-wide for the numbers of students requiring them , but we are acutely aware that secondary pupil numbers will be going up significantly in the next few years .

The situation was exacerbated by the closure of East Brighton College of Media Arts ( COMART ) in Whitehawk in 2005 , which meant that secondary schools were not spread out equally across the city . <p> The radical new system was introduced for the September 2008 intake and combined rigid catchment areas with a computer lottery in an attempt to address the issue of social segregation in schools . <p> It divided the city , with parents both for and against the proposal demonstrating outside Brighton Town Hall when the city council 's children , families and schools committee was due to approve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anger amongst some parents worried they would lose priority for high performing schools in their catchment areas . <p> Some feared their children would be placed at schools much further from their homes . <p> While opponents also feared the council had got its numbers wrong and the catchment areas would not work , Labour councillor Pat Hawkes told The Argus in 2007 : " The new system is fairer for the majority of people in the city . " <p> By March 2008 , the council declared the lottery schools admission system a " soaring success " and that it had achieved its targets of getting more pupils into a local school , with a total of 728 children having their places decided by the lottery , mostly to rule on who won places at Dorothy Stringer School in Loder Road , Brighton , and Blatchington Mill School in Nevill Avenue , Brighton . However , the number of pupils getting places at their first preference school fell from 1,871 in 2007 to 1,843 , a drop from 83.7% to 78.2% . <p> Since 2007 , there have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patcham High School in Ladies Mile Road , Patcham . <p> Share article <p> In 2010 , a report by the Institute of Education and the Universities of London and Bristol found that lotteries alone did not give poor children a higher chance of securing a place at a top school . <p> And last year a report by Lancaster University into inequality in Brighton and Hove claimed that attempts to address inequalities in education through a schools lottery system had been " largely unsuccessful " . <h> Ipsoregulated <p> This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation 's Editors ' Code of Practice .

" Liberal Democrat press release , 12 March 2013 <p> The background <p> FactCheck has been keeping a close eye on the recent explosion in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part-funded by government . <p> There 's no dispute that numbers have soared since the coalition came to power . So much for quantity , but what about quality ? <p> Critics have long raised objections that not all apprenticeships were created equally , raising concerns about the length and rigour of some training offered by employers . <p> Today the Lib Dems launched an attack on Labour 's plans for apprenticeships , accusing the opposition of harbouring " secret plans to scrap half a million " of them . <p> A press release , headlined " Labour calls half a million apprentices ' Deadweight ' " , rammed home the point with a graph neatly showing what will supposedly happen under a Labour government . <p> We think this whole line of attack is nonsense . Here 's why . <p> The analysis <p> Labour 's " secret plans " for apprenticeships are not secret at all . <p> In September last year a Labour policy unit run by independent experts published these recommendations on how the party should reform vocational training . <p> The review highlighted a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectrum over the years . <p> Essentially , the coalition has undoubtedly presided over a massive expansion in apprenticeships . But as these figures from the House of Commons library show , much of the rise in numbers has been driven by people over 25 . <p> There is n't necessarily anything wrong with that , although it means ministers should probably not tout apprenticeships as the big answer to youth unemployment . <p> Another big concern raised in the Labour document is the fact that most apprenticeships tend to be intermediate level ( the equivalent of 5 GCSE passes ) rather than advanced or higher ( equivalent to at least 2 A-level passes -- the blue bars in these government stats ) . <p> The report recommends that Labour redesign and rename intermediate apprenticeships to protect the " apprentice " brand . <p> There is no suggestion in the paper that a Labour government should scrap the funding for people who want to do the equivalent of an intermediate qualification . This would simply be an exercise in rebranding . <p> It also specifically says a Labour government should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar chart and just axe the intermediate apprenticeship overnight . <p> The report states : " These measures would inevitably lead to a dramatic fall in apprenticeship numbers if introduced suddenly . Employers and providers should therefore be given time to improve the quality of their apprenticeships over an agreed period . " <p> Now , we 're not saying Labour are right about the need for this . <p> Actually , the government has already taken some steps to make sure apprenticeships are more rigorous . <p> Labour 's report -- written , remember , in September last year -- has been slightly overtaken by events now . <p> It complains that one in five apprenticeships last for less than six months . But the government has now introduced a one-year minimum for all apprenticeships , so that ca n't happen any more . <p> The policy unit also recommends " asking business what powers they need to ensure they can deliver the expansion in apprenticeships we need to rebuild the economy " . <p> Arguably , that is exactly what the coalition is doing right now by recruiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course we can and should have a debate about which approach will work best . <p> But this press release wo n't help us have a sensible debate , because it misrepresents Labour 's position . <p> Another piece of mischief here is the use of the word " deadweight " in the press release , as though Labour are saying the people doing those apprenticeships are a weight dragging on society . <p> In policy circles , deadweight or " additionality " is simply a technical term for " what would have happened anyway if we had done nothing " . <p> The concern here is that the government is subsidising low-level on-the-job training that companies would have provided to new workers for free . Obviously all governments are keen to avoid shelling out taxpayers ' money for an outcome that would have happened anyway . <p> It 's absolutely clear in the report ( p4 ) that the makers of the report had this sense of the word deadweight in mind when they used it . <p> The opposition 's plans for the reclassification of apprenticeships is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Labour loyalists . <p> But this press release does provide a good example of how the parties are increasingly likely to twist the truth and misrepresent each other 's policies as the one-year countdown to the next general election approaches . <p> From past experience , there should be plenty from all parties to keep FactCheck busy . <h> Comments <p> In the early sixties , I got 4 ' A ' levels and became an apprentice with Unilever .

But after his death I found it hard to return to it because it was too upsetting . Gradually , however , I managed to start baking again , along with my family . <p> It only takes the crack of an egg , or the soft sifting of flour , for me to feel Dad by my side , urging me to bake with ' confidence and instinct ' as he always said .

Their parents before them had also run a teashop -- Beti 's in Ryde on the Isle of Wight . <p> We joked that Dad had chocolate and sugar flowing through his veins : he came from a long line of pastry chefs from a small Swiss-Italian village .

Dad rose early six mornings a week to bake bread and cakes , typically working 14 hours a day . My mum had given up her career as a nurse to become a mother and work in the shop . <p> As for us kids , the tea shop -- with its Forties floral wallpaper and wall clock that chimed every quarter hour -- became our second home .

He smelled of whatever he was making at the time -- in the morning , Danish pastries and doughnuts , in the afternoon , teacakes and Welsh rarebit . <p> Every August the shop would close for two weeks and we 'd go on holiday to a friend 's hotel in the Wicklow Mountains in Ireland . I have fond memories of trout fishing , blackberry-picking and long walks . <p> Louise pictured with her daughter Lara in her father 's tea shop .

Mine gave me chocolate and cakes . <p> Despite the strong family tradition , none of us children followed in Dad 's footsteps -- something he never complained about , but I suspect he would have loved it if we had . <p> Gordon went on to become MD of a drinks company , Johnny a senior police officer and Georgina works in education . <p> As for me , I went off to university to study journalism in 1984 , assuming the shop would always be there . <p> In the early Nineties , I was working on a national newspaper when Mum phoned with the news Dad had collapsed in the bakery . <p> I rushed down to visit him in hospital , where he was diagnosed with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Dad was determined to return to work regardless . <p> So it was n't until January 2000 that Dad decided to close Peter 's after 40 years -- then aged 70 and his health in decline .

As I read the sign on the door thanking people for their loyal custom , I found it hard to believe it was really closing . There were no cake displays in the window , the glass counters lay bare , the fridges were switched off and empty , the dark chocolates gone from the cabinet . <p> There was no gentle hum of conversation , no clattering of cutlery ; the comforting smell of baking replaced by the pong of sterile cleaning fluids . <p> The new caf ? owner had asked Dad to remove the oven , which required my brother and several burly men to help over two to three days .

He told me the measurements and then commanded : ' Now , get your hands in the mixture . Come on , get stuck in .

Each cake , savoury pastry or bread roll conjured up memories and feelings linked to the tea shop , a customer , a member of staff , my family or an event . <p> Memories of Mrs Meringue , as we dubbed her , who ordered them like clockwork .

When I visited , he was always in bed or sitting on the sofa . <p> I clutched his once strong , reassuring hands , remembering how they powered through dough day after day . <p> He did n't speak about his decline and bore it with a quiet dignity . <p> On April 25 , 2012 , Dad died surrounded by his family at a hospice just round the corner from the old tea shop .

One to watch when life seems to be getting too serious and complicated . <p> Favourite Bit : Sir Lancelot storms a castle to save a ' princess ' . <p> Did You Know ?

The Godfather ( 1972 , Francis Ford Coppola ) <p> ' Leave the gun . Take the cannoli . ' <p> The obligatory entry for a masterpiece so evidently brilliant it almost feels enough to just state the title and move on . While gangster films like Goodfellas , good as they are , depreciate with repeated viewings , The Godfather has endured because it is n't just about bad guys taking piano wire to each other 's throats . It is a family soap opera about loyalty , capitalism and the American Dream . The Godfather is so influential it even adds credence to the idea of films informing reality ; real life mafias have actually picked up habits coined in the film , it can be hard to tell who did what first . The ' 70s is considered by many as a golden age in Hollywood . It 's hard to look past The Godfather as the greatest thing to come out of the system in that time . <p> Favourite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sollozo and Captain McCluskey . <p> Did You Know ? Marlon Brando did not memorise a lot of his lines and read from cue cards during most of the film . <p> 04 . Drunken Master ( 1978 , Woo-ping Yuen ) <p> ' Drink , boy ! ' <p> With a string of Hollywood movies alongside people such as Chris Tucker -- this is n't to take away from perfectly enjoyable romps such as Rush Hour -- it can be easy to forget that Jackie Chan has been in some seriously excellent films . Drunken Master sees a young , impertinent Jackie Chan learn a bizarre style of martial art that revolves around drinking as much alcohol as possible in order to beat up a very bad man . It is n't Dostoevsky , admittedly , but it is delivered with a sort of charm that has never really found its way into Jackie Chan 's Western work . <p> However , in martial arts films , as important as a story can be for context , you come and stay for the fights and in Drunken Master they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sequences that put all the shaky cam nonsense of today to shame .

Chinatown ( 1974 , Roman Polanski ) <p> ' You 're dumber than you think I think you are . ' <p> In an ideal world , every budding screenwriter would be forced to sit down and watch Chinatown on loop for a week . Roman Polanski 's scintillating neo-noir , written from the pen of Robert Towne , lacks the tautness of its ' 40s/ ' 50s brethren but is easily the equal to the genre 's biggest hitters , with a script so slick you could close your eyes and be in for a treat even before factoring in the gorgeous cinematography . It boasts a labyrinthine plot populated by subverted characters : Jack Nicholson 's smart alec PI Jake Gittes does n't really know all the answers , the ' femme fatale ' is arguably the only selfless person in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone was ready for . It also has lovely instances of low-fi detective work , such as Gittes determining when a car leaves somewhere by letting it run over his watch . <p> Oh , and forget One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest or The Shining , Jack Nicholson never bettered this performance . <p> Favourite Bit : That painful last line . <p> Did You Know ? The scene where Roman Polanski slits Jack Nicholson 's nose was extremely complex to film , and the two men involved got so tired of explaining how it was done ( by using a specially-constructed knife with a short hinge that would be safe as long as it was handled VERY carefully ) that they began to claim Nicholson 's nose was actually cut . <p> 02 . Mirror ( 1975 , Andrei Tarkovsky ) <p> ' And I ca n't wait to see this dream in which I 'll be a child again and feel happy again because everything will be still ahead , everything will be possible . ' <p> Sometimes you watch a film that overwhelms you so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how . Tarkovsky 's most challenging creation is perhaps the clearest example of this type of filmmaking . It is a film inspired by the life of Andrei Tarkovsky . The Russian presents us fragments of his life in a non-linear fashion along with film reels that reflect not only his deepest thoughts and feelings , but of Russian national identity as well . It is the movie equivalent of stream of consciousness writing . <p> Mirror is challenging . Tarkovsky asks an awful lot of the viewer . He breaks down time barriers and moves between scenes with seemingly no logical sequence ; and the scenes that are there are of small , insignificant moments , using actors to play multiple roles without any signposting . It is essentially plotless , but Tarkovsky 's earnestness and skill stops the project from becoming self-indulgent or pretentious . It is a nightmare to try and ' sell ' Mirror , a film that quite frankly defies description . It 's possibly the most beautiful film I have ever seen ( not just visually , either ) , and despite not fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moves me deeply with every viewing . <p> Favourite Bit : A tracking sequence of a family 's shack set ablaze . <p> Did You Know ? Tarkovsky was initially set on the title , A White , White Day before settling for Mirror , or Zerkalo as it is known in Russia . <p> 01 . The Spirit of the Beehive ( 1973 , Victor Erice ) <p> ' Why did he kill the girl , and why did they kill him after that ? ' <p> Victor Erice does n't tend to make a lot of films ; in fact , his output makes Terrence Malick seem like some sort of prolific filmmaking juggernaut . But , when he does , he tends to knock it out of the park . His debut , Spirit of the Beehive ( inspiration for Guillermo del Toro 's Pan 's Labyrinth ) , is not only one of the crowning jewels of its decade , but one of world cinema 's most outstanding achievements . It is at once a very subtle ( and brave ) condemnation of Franco 's post-Civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tale of children 's inevitable loss of innocence that transcends time , allowing one to identify bits of their own childhood experience regardless of its setting . <p> At the heart of this is Ana Torrent who I believe delivers the single finest child acting performance in history , playing a young girl exposed to Frankenstein -- ergo death -- for the first time . It would probably be at the number one spot if only for Torrent 's performance , but the sumptuous visuals and quiet , wistful tone give Spirit of the Beehive a remarkable , unequalled atmosphere . <p> Favourite Bit : Ana and Isabel practise shaving in the bathroom . <p> Did You Know ? A fact that makes me feel guilty for the two working eyes I have : cinematographer Luis Cuadrado was going blind at the time this film was made .

In her manipulation of a succession of overlapping triangles of which the book 's title is only one , Oyeyemi suggests the possibility of a kind of redemption ; that identities eventually settle , configure , cohere and that we all learn to live with the life that we have fashioned for ourselves .

But Ioanna Klapa and Maria Dimitropoulou , long-time friends who belong to Greece 's first generation of female judges , have gone about the business of dissecting Golden Dawn with the precision of a surgeon . <p> After trawling though computers confiscated from the far-right party 's leaders , examining witnesses and wading through thousands of videos , pictures , speeches , documents and blogs , the court officials have compiled a 15,000-page dossier outlining why they believe Golden Dawn is a criminal organisation . <p> Under the weight of their inquiry -- spurred by the murder of a leftwing musician at the hands of a senior party operative in September last year -- the extremist group has begun to crack . Last week one Golden Dawn MP resigned , citing ignorance of the party 's activities . Another was expelled after indicating that he , too , was about to leave . <p> " The justice system is one of the few meritocratic institutions in Greece and both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiercely independent and non-partisan , " said Aliki Mouriki , a sociologist at the National Centre of Social Research .

In February Klapa and Dimitropoulou proposed that politicians lift the immunity of another nine MPs who have so far escaped prosecution . A parliamentary vote is expected in the coming weeks . <p> The far-rightists have responded with a torrent of venom , accusing the judges of working to an agenda masterminded by the " rotten " political establishment .

With record levels of poverty and unemployment , the neo-Nazis went from strength to strength . <p> " The failure of anybody to speak out in a country that experienced such brutal Nazi occupation is absolutely inexcusable , " said the 92-year-old poet Nanos Valaouritis , one of the few to openly address the issue .

" <p> At other times , his references to the south were less self-mocking , and more straightforwardly proud . His 1972 recording , An American Trilogy , is a medley of three 19th century numbers . It carefully balances a Bahamian lullaby -- All My Trials -- with the Union Army song , The Battle Hymn of the Republic , and the blackface minstrel number , Dixie , popular among Confederate troops : <p> " Oh I wish I was in the land of cotton , Old times they are not forgotten ; Look away !

That view declined in 1969 with his release of In the Ghetto , the story of lives blighted by gun crime in the Chicago projects . <p> So Elvis did n't just shape America 's musical tastes in his lifetime ; what a haunting prediction of the American future he was on his deathbed . <p> His addiction to junk food has spread across America , as his addiction to prescription drugs -- he was the king of the worried well , or not so well , as it turned out . But , on a happier front , he gave us a small glimpse of a perhaps impossible dream -- a post-racial America .

@@2386235 <p> The coal mine and adjoining power station in the small Australian town of Anglesea suffers from not one , but two incongruities . <p> Anglesea , in Victoria , unlike its windswept Welsh namesake , is a bucolic surf location that sees a huge influx of visitors as temperatures soar in the summer months . It 's not your archetypal mining town , even to its residents . " People who visit here , or people who have n't lived here long do n't know the mine is here , " says local doctor Jacinta Morahan . " It 's well hidden " . <p> The second , and more glaring , unease is the power station 's location . Situated just minutes from the heart of the small township , the plant , owned by Alcoa , the world 's third largest producer of aluminum , is less than 1km from Anglesea 's sole primary school . <p> Concern about the health impacts of the emissions and coal dust that spew from the power station and open-cut mine has divided the town , which has only 3,000 permanent residents . <p> Alcoa has operated the Anglesea plant since the 1960s . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in nearby Point Henry which , in turn , churns out aluminium for various Asian markets , as well as for most of Australia 's drinks cans . The Age says that the aluminium smelter is soon-to-close , but the power plant could still find a buyer and stay open . <p> The Anglesea power station is fed brown coal from its nearby mine . Brown coal , which is used to power most of the state of Victoria , is an extremely carbon intensive fuel and also heavily water-laden , making its use highly energy-intensive . The Anglesea plant emits 1.2m tonnes of CO2 a year -- around double the entire annual emissions of the African nation of Liberia . <p> But the more immediate worry for some residents is its other emissions , namely sulphur dioxide ( SO2 ) and coal dust particles . Both have been linked to respiratory problems and complications in people with existing health issues , such as heart disease . <p> While Victoria bans the building of any wind farm within 2km of a residential building , no such restriction exists for coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zones " be set up to lessen health impacts . Anglesea 's power plant is just 200 metres from the nearest house , but it is its proximity to the primary school that raises most attention . <p> " The main problems is the lack of information -- we just do n't know if it 's safe , " says Tabitha Lowdan , a caf ? owner who has two children at the school and a third due to join . " There 's been a meeting with the principal and the overriding feeling was anxiety and unease . People are really worried about it . " <p> Lowdan is concerned that children play outdoors at times when there are high levels of SO2 in the air , claiming that Alcoa does n't provide enough information on its emissions . Some parents -- but by no means a stampede -- have removed children from the school . <p> " I believe in being local and it 's a long way to the next school , " says Lowdan . " People have been accepting of Alcoa but it 's slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups -- the football club , the surf club and so on . The groups who get funding from them tend to not be so critical of them . " <p> Alcoa points out that it is in compliance with the law , which demands that it does n't exceed 200 parts per billion of SO2 in its emissions . It has n't breached this standard since 2009 . The company has six air monitors dotted around Anglesea , including the school , and has staff watching screens to determine if the weather conditions and emissions levels demand a reduction in power load . " It 's hard to know how many people do n't like how we do things , but we try very hard to talk to the community and engage with them , " says Chris Rolland , the site manager .

" <p> To try to allay these fears , Alcoa has its own doctor , Michael Donoghue , and is more open and accommodating than most fossil fuel companies . Despite some studies suggesting that long-term exposure to coal dust and SO2 , even at very low levels , Donoghue says there is no cause for alarm . <p> " When you 're in compliance with these standards , the risks are really low , " he says . " Can you say there 's zero risk ? No , you ca n't . But the risks are very small when you compare to cities , which put out a lot of emissions through vehicles and so on . The critical part is the exposure . If it 's low , the risk is accordingly very low .

" The companies that do the reports for us have their own professional reputations to uphold . " <p> For some residents , the price of cheap power to create aluminium is too high . No adverse effects in Anglesea have been proven but critics of the power station claim that studies in the US and Europe show the emissions are a health time bomb , especially for children . <p> " It would be great if they immediately put in scrubber technology to reduce emissions , because at the moment they are putting a price on the health of kids , " says Lowdan .

Five , 10 , a bushel , a kilo ? The more , the merrier ? Ha ha ha ! <p> But as I was looking for a payoff that had Ukip promising to reposition sprouts from Brussels to Barnsley , I realised the joke was on me . There really is new scientific research -- and perfectly credible too -- that says our five-a-day is getting us nowhere fast ; that it is the nutritional equivalent of moving the deckchairs around the Titanic . <p> Specifically , researchers found that eating seven helpings a day of fruit or vegetables could reduce a person 's overall risk of premature death by 42 per cent when compared with people who ate just one portion . Still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ optimum number , as the protective effect increases with every extra portion . <p> Woe betide , then , those eating a mere five portions , as based on World Health Organisation recommendations issued in 1990 , which advised consuming 400g of fruit and vegetables each day to lower the risk of heart disease , stroke , type 2 diabetes and obesity . And yet -- only 30 per cent of us manage that anyway . <p> I say " us " -- but let 's look a little closer to home , shall we ? Like you , in the Lambert kitchen , we try to keep on top of all this healthy eating guidance . Look around and there are plenty of nods to recent advice . <p> There are the porridge oats ( good for cholesterol ) ; here is the empty wrapper for 70 per cent dark chocolate ( reduces blood pressure ) ; and over in the larder you 'll find walnuts ( antioxidants ) , pole-caught tuna in spring water ( protein ) , cinnamon ( steadies the blood sugar ) and -- look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way , will you ? -- cod liver oil for vitamin D. <p> And constantly underfoot -- like an old Labrador and just as smelly -- is the large box of home-delivered organic fruit and veg with which I try to plump out each meal ( before the leftovers get fed to the rabbits ) . <p> So surely my family must be part of the 30 per cent ? Well , I 'm not so sure we manage it every day . So far I 've had a handful of blueberries and I might grab a tomato at lunchtime or some salad leaves . But that 's leaving an awful lot of veg to pack into my evening meal is n't it ? <p> Checking the NHS website for confirmation , I find that while one tomato counts as a portion , it takes two handfuls of blueberries to make another helping , and I 'd need to put away a whole dessert bowl of lettuce .

So no wonder campaigners are calling for fruit and veg to be subsidised to help everyone afford them in place of junk food . <p> But I 'm afraid I do n't see cost as the major hurdle . It 's not just the thought of the sheer quantity of fruit and veg you 'd need to buy in that makes this 10 portions sound a bit pie in the sky -- although can you imagine how many damp boxes smelling of old boots would clutter our homes ?

Read the reviews round-up <p> After nine seasons of How I Met Your Mother , Ted Mosby 's ( Josh Radnor ) monologue finally drew to a close last night when the last ever episode aired on CBS in the US and , as is so often the case with long-running series , there was some dissatisfaction with its conclusion . <p> Since 2005 viewers have watched the lives of the five central characters unfold , with each episode tied together by Future Ted 's narration . His children , seen sitting on the sofa at the beginning of every episode , have been patiently listening to the story of their father 's quest for love , marriage and happiness along with us . <p> In the final episode Barney ( Neil Patrick Harris ) and Robin ( Cobie Smulders ) , whose wedding had been the central focus of the entire ninth season , got divorced .

Not everyone thought this was a good idea ... <p> " The finale of How I Met Your Mother had the same problem that the show has always had .

As a founding team captain on Have I Got News For You , his knuckles have left a lasting impression on panellists including Jimmy Savile , Piers Morgan and Neil Hamilton ; but switch over to one of his documentaries , which have graced all of the more thoughtful channels , and we find a wryly avuncular character . Sometimes he 's even cosy , and that 's something a satirist never should . <p> During two and a half decades ensuring HIGNFY remains buoyant in the Friday night ratings , he has undoubtedly paid his televisual dues , and has been allowed to make the kind of programme that certainly wo n't be challenging Strictly in the ratings . We 've had his explorations of Baden-Powell , Beeching , and banking philanthropists , among others : all respectfully received , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from such a redoubtable campaigning journalist . <p> Tonight 's programme could have been one of his more topical . The apparent drift of " Olden Days : the Power of the Past " ( why did a journalist of his acuity let the BBC get away with this fog of a title ? ) was an incisive critique of Britain 's obsession with the past . ( As so often , where " Britain " is cited , we never properly left England . ) Cue , perhaps , a broadside against Faragiste 1950s nostalgia , or Cameron 's Big Society ? <p> Perhaps the next generation , with the benefit of Michael Gove 's new British curriculum , will have the Dark Ages at its fingertips <p> Instead , we headed back to the Dark Ages . And for most of the programme , we stayed there , as Hislop examined the sly and expedient manner in which Kings Alfred and Arthur have been appropriated by all manner of political notables . There were some fascinating examples . The Fellows of University College , Oxford invented a connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land dispute ; while Henry VIII recreated Arthur in his own image to impress the Holy Roman Emperor . <p> Surely , though , there 's some context missing . Henry VIII was , rightly or wrongly , taking England in a revolutionary new direction , as she abandoned Catholicism after a millennium in the Roman See . He needed some historical foundations for his task ; Britain today is , in her official profile at least , all historical foundation and no superstructure . Eventually , in the last ten minutes , the contemporary perspective arrived . Hislop 's argument would , however , have been more vivid had he explored the contemporary connections from the start , with a clearer , stronger introduction . <p> " Everybody knows ... " Hislop said several times , referring to the assumed common knowledge of the Alfred and Arthur stories , with their quaint details about stones and burnt cakes .

@@2421232 is policing Greater Manchester Police ? <h> Police violence has been a running theme in the anti-fracking protests at Barton Moss . Individual officers are acting with impunity . Is this a deliberate strategy to disrupt the protests on behalf of vested interests ? David Cullen investigates ... <p> ... a deliberate strategy of eliminating , disrupting or suppressing the protests against fracking at Barton Moss , under which officers know that excessive or violent behaviour will be overlooked or even tacitly condoned . <p> On January 14th Dr. Steve Peers , a legal observer at the anti-fracking ' protectors ' camp at Barton Moss , was filming three police officers arresting a protester . <p> Video he took shows one of the officers realising they were being filmed , walking up to Steve and pushing him backwards onto the floor . <p> Shortly afterwards another officer walked up to him and jostled him away from the arrest , pushing him down the road . <p> Now , this is where it gets strange ... <p> This officer then started repeatedly asking if Steve had been drinking alcohol before aggressively asserting that he had and loudly claiming that Steve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for refusing to submit to breath test . <p> Steve does his legal observing with a video camera permanently mounted on a hard-hat that he wears , so it is inconceivable that the officer did not realise he was being filmed as he made this vindictive and wrongful arrest on a totally false charge . <p> This is the strangest part of the whole incident : why was the police officer not concerned that this brazen abuse of power was being caught on camera ? Did he really have such confidence in his impunity ? <p> Setting the scene <p> The anti-fracking camp runs along the verge of Barton Moss Road , which is used by trucks dropping off equipment at the iGas drilling site , often several times a day . Each time a truck arrives the protesters line up on the road , walking slowly in front of the trucks and their police escort . <p> The iGas site is currently home to a test drilling rig , but the expectation is that if the results of the test drilling are positive , iGas will try to extract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the controversial method of fracking . <p> Fracking involves pumping water and chemicals into the rock at extremely high pressure in the hope that it will fracture and release the gas . It has been linked with earthquakes and water pollution . <p> Shale gas is also a carbon intensive fossil fuel , a resource which needs to remain unexploited if we are to have a reasonable chance of avoiding catastrophic climate change . <p> Many other examples of heavy-handed policing <p> The incident with Dr. Steve Peers is only one example of heavy-handed policing at Barton Moss . I might instead have described in detail the disabled man shoved into a ditch by police rushing to arrest a pregnant woman who was simply walking in the crowd . <p> Or perhaps the legal observer who suffered a broken eye socket during a particularly violent arrest which was caught on camera . Or the 15-year old girl on her first visit to the camp , who had been hoping to gather material for use in a school geography project , but instead was arrested while she was simply walking down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be easy to dismiss as the excesses of individual officers . But taken together , it seems that something more systematic is going on . <p> Indeed , the strategic behaviour of Greater Manchester Police ( GMP ) strongly suggests they are deploying a deliberate strategy of eliminating , disrupting or suppressing the protests against fracking at Barton Moss , under which officers know that excessive or violent behaviour will be overlooked or even tacitly condoned . <p> The road to Barton Moss - powerful people stand to get rich <p> Fracking is a policy without a democratic mandate . The coalition government was formed with a promise to be " the greenest government ever " , and fracking was not included in either Liberal Democrat or Conservative manifestos at the last election . <p> A number of individuals within or close to government stand to make a considerable amount of money as a result of this policy change , including the chancellor 's father in law . <p> Local opinion is overwhelmingly opposed to fracking , but Salford Council have granted a license at Barton Moss . Peel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as large areas of Salford and the North West , have long been criticised for wielding undue influence over Salford Council . <p> The council also indirectly own shares in iGas , the company who are drilling at the site , through the Greater Manchester Pension Fund . <p> This is the political context for the policing operation at Barton Moss , and GMP seem to have interpreted it as a license to suppress protest . <p> While some of the police tactics fit into a generaltrend towards more repressive policing of protest in the UK , misuse of the law as a tool to suppress dissent is considerably more flagrant than has been seen elsewhere . <p> Playing the ' terrorism card ' <p> On the 6th January , GMP raided the Barton Moss camp and searched it under Seection 43 of the Terrorism Act 2000 . The raid was immediately press-released by GMP , who claimed they acted in response to a flare fired from the camp at a police helicopter . <p> The story spread , gaining much widerpresscoverage than most stories about Barton Moss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flare . During the search the police left sleeping bags and clothing outside tents in the rain and mud : potentially a serious risk to the wellbeing of people living outside in the middle of the wettest winter on record . <p> The Section 43 power does not require a warrant , but is supposed to be used only when a police officer " reasonably suspects " a person might be a terrorist . There are numerous video cameras in the vicinity of the camp , including a thermal imaging camera on the helicopter itself , which should have been able to see the heat signature and path of the flare . <p> After the search failed to find any evidence to link the camp to the flare , GMP were challenged to release any video evidence they have of the incident , but have not done so . <p> Policing by PR ? <p> Even if GMP 's version of events is completely true , it is clear that they seized an opportunity to search the camp without a warrant and to generate negative press about the camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police often use the press not to inform the public , but to pursue their own agenda , even if this involves misleading the public or spreading false information . <p> The flare incident is reminiscent of police announcements of a " cache of weapons " discovered near the Climate Camp in Kingsnorth in 2008 , or the oil slick on the A8 attributed to the Climate Camp in Edinburgh in 2010 . <p> Whilst extensive coverage of the protests at Barton Moss can be found in the local press , particularly the Salford Star , a local community newspaper , the national press have undertaken only intermittent coverage . This makes ' policing by PR ' all the more damaging . <p> A suspiciously low number of ' incidents ' ? - here 's why <p> Furthermore , complaints figures seem to have been organised to make them useful within this strategy of policing by PR . For example - solicitor Simon Pook , when complaining about an officer who did not intervene when a car stuck somebody at the camp , was issued with an incident number for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he questioned this , he was told that all complaints relating to policing at the camp were grouped together as a single incident . <p> This is probably the reason for the suspiciously low number of complaints against the police quoted in a press-released public statement by Peter Fahy , Chief Constable of GMP . <p> Unlawful bail conditions <p> The police abusing their power to unilaterally set bail conditions is a recurring feature of the policing of protest in the UK . This power is only supposed to be used in limited circumstances , for example where it is necessary to prevent a further crime being committed or to stop the arrestee absconding . <p> Instead it seems that the police regard bail conditions as a way to gain an injunction without the hassle of having to make the legal case for one . They are used to intimidate or punish people exercising their right to protest , giving them nightly curfews or excluding them from entire geographic areas . <p> This use of bail conditions by the UK police was specifically criticised by the UN Special Rapporteur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the UN Human Rights Council . <p> Despite this warning , and disregarding existing case-law , GMP have routinely set excessive bail conditions for those arrested at Barton Moss , banning them from returning to the camp . This began with the first arrest in November 2013 . Each subsequent arrest received near-identical bail conditions . <p> Bail itself is used as a form of punishment <p> Within days of the first arrest these bail conditions had been successfully challenged in the courts and replaced with unconditional bail . But GMP have ignored the fact that every time a court has scrutinised the bail conditions they have been overturned , continuing to hand out the same punitive bail conditions to all arrestees . <p> It is n't possible to discern why GMP have continued to pursue a policy which contradicts existing case law , breaches human rights legislation and flies in the face of the recommendations of a UN Special Rapporteur . <p> When I asked them what guidance was being used in setting bail conditions they would not give specifics . However , it seems likely that part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with people 's right to protest . <p> It has also allowed GMP to quote inflated and misleading numbers of arrests in their public statements . At the time of writing more than one arrest in every ten was for breach of bail conditions : bail conditions which should never have been set in the first place . <p> While GMP have publicly complained about the cost of their policing operation at Barton Moss , citing the number of arrests , their public statements have not mentioned the cost to the taxpayer of the police work , detention , court time and lawyers generated by their refusal to comply with the rule of law when setting bail conditions . <p> Knowingly bringing false charges <p> Questions also remain over the offences used to charge people at Barton Moss . Until recently , all those arrested in connection with stopping or slowing the trucks on Barton Moss Lane were charged with obstruction of the highway . <p> This seemed a little counter-intuitive , as the lane is a public footpath on a private road , not a public highway . GMP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a civil case brought against them by one of the protesters , and officers were also photographed in early January taking away footpath signs from the lane . <p> After the first arrest in November it was made clear within a matter of days that those charged with obstruction of the highway would use the defence that the lane was not a public highway , and could well be acquitted . <p> Nonetheless , GMP continued to arrest and charge people with the same offence for the next three months . When the inevitable ruling came on 13th February that the lane was not a highway , this meant that around 50 individuals had been wrongfully arrested and had their cases dismissed . <p> No more Mr Nice Guy <p> After a day where the protesters were allowed to block trucks from accessing the drilling site , the police returned and delivered what appears to have been a dose of retributory violence . <p> One woman was hospitalised after being apparently strangled and dragged through mud in handcuffs , and the police were witnessed hitting out , attacking photographers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that day and subsequently have been made for aggravated trespass , rather than obstruction of the highway . <p> As the offense of aggravated trespass has been available to the police throughout , the question arises of why they persisted in arresting people for obstruction of the highway for three months when there was a good chance they would be acquitted . <p> Aggravated trespass carries a higher penalty and would almost certainly have been easier to prove given the situation at Barton Moss Lane , so why did n't the police use it ? <p> Obstructing legal representation <p> One key difference between the two charges is that individuals accused of obstructing the highway are not eligible for legal aid to fight the charge . <p> Without legal work being taken on pro bono by local solicitor Simon Pook and barrister Richard Brigden , it is likely that the wrongful arrests for obstructing the highway could have resulted in successful prosecutions , and that unlawful police bail conditions would almost certainly have been unchallenged - a miscarriage of justice effecting over 60 people . <p> If it seems unthinkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to make it more difficult for them to access legal representation , note this . <p> The solicitors firm representing most of the arrestees has had several clients report police behaviour intended to deny them their fundamental legal rights . On one occasion a defendant was simply told that their chosen solicitor 's firm were " too busy " - and although a member of the firm was actually present in the same police station they were not consulted on the matter . <p> On another occasion Simon Pook was prevented from visiting a client in hospital by a police officer who pushed him and told him to " fuck off " . <p> In the absence of a more plausible explanation , the obvious conclusion is that GMP deliberately set out to suppress the dissent at Barton Moss by arresting numerous individuals on a bogus charge where they were not eligible for legal aid and presenting them with unlawful bail conditions which interfered with their right to protest . <p> Far from being " stuck in the middle " as claimed by Chief ConstablePeter Fahy , GMP has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utilised with maximum leverage to achieve the desired outcome - the suppression of dissent at Barton Moss . <p> Policing in the absence of democracy <p> Almost all of the elected representatives which are supposed to hold GMP to account are supportive of fracking at Barton Moss , and have so far failed to provide any meaningful oversight . <p> The elected police commissioner for Greater Manchester , Tony Lloyd ( who draws a salary of ? 100,000 and commands a staff of 40 ) , was silent over the first 2 months of the protests and police violence , only issuing a mild statement of concern in early February . <p> Following recent events he has set up an ' independent panel ' to investigate the protests , but it remains to be seen whether the panel can seriously act as a check on the actions of GMP . <p> Although one local MP has voiced concerns about the policing operation , not a single Salford city councillor has made any public statement on the issue , nor has the elected mayor . Meanwhile , the prime minister has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " irrationality . <p> A growing gap between the rulers , and the ruled <p> The policing at Barton Moss needs to be understood in the light of this discrepancy between the support of elected representatives and the widespread opposition of local people . <p> When those in power feel they are entitled to decide policy without consulting people who are likely to be affected , it is hardly surprising that any dissent by those people will be regarded as illegitimate . It is only a small step from there to enforcing contentious policy using violence , and deploying the law as a tool to suppress dissent . <p> Just as the most obvious explanation for the violence used by individual officers is that they believe they have tacit approval of their superiors and expect to be protected by them , the most obvious explanation for the tactics and strategy that GMP are pursuing is that they believe they have tacit approval and expect to be protected by their political masters . <p> And it 's getting worse <p> The indications are that police violence at Barton Moss has got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are fears that if Peel Holdings are successful in their application for an eviction order for the camp , GMP may take the opportunity to be even more brutal . <p> Barton Moss is an advanced case of what policing looks like when those in power work on behalf of private and corporate interests , rather than the people they are supposed to be serving .

" <p> The action plan <p> The Orange Revolution is a 1,500-day campaign , and therefore not all elements of the campaign were implemented immediately , but delivered over the four years . <p> To date , three core elements of the Orange Revolution campaign have been put in place . <p> Orange Force:NTUC Income established a fleet of 30 trained motorcyclists in orange outfits who could ride in twenty minutes to traffic accidents and problems to help with first aid , help fill out insurance forms , offer advice on the scene and reduce the incidence of fraud . An important part of Orange Force is that the assistants did not just help NTUC Income policyholders , but also assisted non-policyholders . In fact , by end of 2012 over half of those assisted were non-policyholders . <p> Orange Speak : Alongside Orange Force , the campaign also shifted the way it dealt with its customers by ensuring that all dealings , and contracts , were written in clear and easy to understand terminology . <p> This is a key element in realising NTUC Income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Specifically , as part of this element of the campaign , NTUC Income undertook the Crystal Mark initiative , a globally recognised standard for plain English which guarantees that a document offers simple , clear and concise information . It has now achieved more Crystal Marks than any other business in Asia : NTUC Income has over 50 Crystal Marks and over 95% of NTUC Income 's customers now have their contracts issued with Crystal Marks . <p> Orange First : This campaign focused on the staff , partners and financial advisers working on behalf of NTUC Income . It rewards the sales force -- through awards and other initiatives -- for dealing with customers in a trustworthy and transparent way . <p> This element of the campaign reflects the fact that an externally facing campaign requires internal buy-in from across the customer-facing workforce if it is to be delivered successfully and consistently . <p> In line with the rest of Orange Revolution , though , whilst Orange First is internally focused , it also has a promotional side . A multi-media advertising campaign -- including TV , print @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's commitment to Orange First amongst its staff , showing in turn NTUC Income 's role in making insurance simple , honest and different . <p> A significant part of the Orange Revolution is NTUC Income putting its campaign into practice -- not simply viewing it as a marketing campaign but as a fundamentally different way of operating as a business , evidenced by the number of people the Orange Force motorcyclists have helped who are not NTUC Income policyholders . <p> For example , during the ' ash cloud ' eruption that affected international travel in 2010 , NTUC Income was not legally obliged to offer payouts to travel insurance policy-holders . However , it chose to honour the intent of the policy , paying out approximately $400,000 to around 400 claimants . <p> The impact <p> As on an on-going campaign that will finish around the end of 2015 , the full impact of the Orange Revolution can not be assessed . However , it is clear that some significant changes have been made . <p> Financial impact : Due to some significant changes to the regulation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NTUC Income has seen only modest financial growth since the beginning of the Orange Revolution campaign . <p> Some growth was seen in its general insurance and motor insurance products . NTUC Income is now the leading composite insurer in Singapore , serving over 2 million customers with about 3.8 million policies and assets of $30.8 billion . <p> 22% of all private cars and 49% of all motorcycles are insured by NTUC Income . <p> Social impact : NTUC Income clearly defines itself as both a co-operative and a social enterprise . <p> In 2010 it established Orange Aid , a fund for underprivileged children and youth . 1% of the company 's operating profits ( $1.9 million ) was invested in Orange Aid in 2012 . In addition , the business also contributes approximately $4.5 million annually ( 2.6% of its operating profits ) towards the labour movement and related charity and community projects . <p> Reputation impact : In 2012 , NTUC Income was named Singapore 's Best Car Insurer by the AsiaOne People 's Choice Award , and was recognised as the best in health and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Customer Satisfaction Index of Singapore . <p> Tan Suee Chieh , in recognition of his role in the transformation of NTUC , was awarded Outstanding Chief executive Officer of the Year 2012 at the Singapore Business Awards 2013 . <p> In 2007 , the average number of complaints that NTUC Income received each month was 274 . In 2012 it was reduced to 71 , whilst three times more compliments than complaints are received each month . <p> Specifically , at the end of 2012 , just over one year in , the Orange Force had handled more than 10,000 engagements whilst receiving over 400 compliments from customers .

Thick fog from Bodmin Moor clasps the Jamaica Inn , where my travelling companion and I are spending the night . The barman has kindly let us visit the inn 's museum after hours , so we can learn more about the inspiration for Daphne du Maurier 's historical novel Jamaica Inn , before we leave in the morning . Dark shadows lurk around us as we watch an educational video about smugglers and lawbreakers in the area . The lights are flickering . We ca n't tell if it 's deliberate .

Built as a coach house in 1750 , this renowned building became a smugglers den between the 17th and 19th century . Novelist Daphne du Maurier stayed here for three days in 1930 after getting lost on the moor , and her time here inspired the gritty novel of the same name , filled with smugglers , violence and sex . <p> Today , the roadhouse is a dubious beacon against untamed Cornish countryside . The uninviting exterior is made of hardy stone and grey Cornish slate . In the cobble-stoned foreground , Victorian-style street lamps cast light over a giant rusty anchor and some medieval-looking stocks -- used to humiliate law-breakers in the olden days . Inside , the building is chock full of tributes to Daphne du Maurier and smuggling . Rooms in the old part of the house are named ' Francis Davey , ' ' Harry the Pedlar ' and ' Squire Basil ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bar reads ' on this spot Joss Merlyn was murdered ' , a nod to the threatening smuggler from the tale , played by Sean Harris in the new series .

The d ? cor no doubt helps fuel the ghostly stories surrounding the property , which is said to be one of the most haunted sites in Britain . <p> Cornish local Julia Lawrence has worked at Jamaica Inn for more than a decade , and as we leave the museum she tells us more about the strange occurrences she 's witnessed .

Okita seems to be carving a very specific niche in Japanese cinema , with films focused on downtrodden , marginalised men with identity issues struggling to find their place in contemporary society . Such a premise is nothing new , and to draw attention to such male ineptitude for comedy value is now a staple of male centred Hollywood vehicles for the likes of Seth Rogen . <p> Whilst boasting more than its fair share of amusing anecdotal moments focusing on its main character 's numerous flaws and shortcomings , The Story of Yonosuke marks both itself and its director Okita apart by its refusal to conform to being a simplistic crowdpleaser .

A seemingly straightforward ' fish out of water ' narrative is transformed into a sophisticated character study thanks to Okita 's subtle and assured direction .

People were dying by the road , " he says , reflecting on the deadly famine of 30 years ago , which prompted the Live Aid concerts and one of the world 's greatest ever humanitarian relief efforts . <p> " Everyone was thirsty , thin , very weak -- not strong like now . It was difficult to guess that it could be better . But now the bad times wo n't come back . " <p> Mr Beletew 's confidence is reflected by the variety of crops growing around him in Ethiopia 's Antsokia Valley . <p> As well as mangos , his farm now produces papayas , oranges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as teff -- a type of cereal -- onions , sorghum and maize . Bee hives hang from three of his trees , while sheep and chickens provide further income . <p> It is a stark contrast with three decades ago , when Antsokia was one of the first areas to suffer the full force of a drought that led to two years of famine , death and malnutrition in Ethiopia . <p> Rainfall shortages , accentuated by the effects of climate change , continue to menace the area . <p> But , as Mr Beletew explains , the people of Antsokia are now equipped to cope after learning more productive agricultural techniques from World Vision , a charity which helped bring the famine to the world 's attention by flying in BBC journalist Michael Buerk for a landmark 1984 report that exposed the emerging crisis . <p> Since then the charity has taught farmers to grow new foods , as well as organic fertilising and crop rotation methods that improve soil quality . <p> Mr Beletew says that tuition on water preservation has brought even greater benefits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ channel running across his land . <p> " Thirty years ago , it was not just drought that was the problem : we did n't know how to use our resources properly so water was wasted , " he says . <p> " Now we know how to use water more efficiently .

For those who ca n't speak Japanese , that subtitle roughly translates to -- and we 're not making this up -- ' Please Give Birth to My Child ' . Still , the original received positive reviews in the East and prompted Atlus to localize its sequel overseas . <p> Much like a Final Fantasy title , the plot is independent of its predecessor , meaning that you wo n't need to be familiar with the original to understand the story here . The narrative deals with a malevolent Dusk Energy , which has been leaking out of portal-like labyrinths and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aterra . Fortunately , the Star God that the planet 's inhabitants worship has granted certain teenagers with the power of the Star Brand . <p> As a result of this mark , they become Disciples to combat and keep the monsters at bay , but it 's impossible to eliminate the endless sources that the beasts come from . That is , until you arrive . As the long fabled God 's Gift , you , along with the help of seven girls capable of spawning Star Children , are the world 's last hope and must use your newfound abilities to rid the planet of the evil that 's plaguing it once and for all . <p> You could dismiss the whole game based on its premise alone -- especially the part about Star Children . To be clear , the protagonist actually needs to " classmate " with several girls to conceive these monster-fighting kids , which are created by his Ether and their Star Energy . Yes , it 's weird , but there 's some quality to the narrative 's complexity . Indeed , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' histories , past plot points , and back stories . There 's much more to sink your teeth into , too , and we were fascinated with how these aspects intertwined to create a compelling yarn . <p> The personalities you encounter may be a bit of a mixed bag , but the seven girls that you interact with in particular all have loveable , fun traits and understandable faults . We wanted to get to know each one because they reveal more about their past and true feelings if you treat them respectfully . As such , you 'll spend a lot of your time reading dialogue and watching the 3D gals chat to you , often picking preset sentence responses in order to converse with them . Although there could have been ways to make these conversations more engaging -- like with more serious , meaningful topics or a timer -- we did n't expect to enjoy the offering here as much as we did . <p> In regard to " classmating " , we initially expected it to merely be a juvenile feature , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a serious , necessary ritual that 's more important than their desires ; it 's primarily conducted to create Star Children to save the world , and many characters hold it in that regard . Still , the game does n't shy away from its more inappropriate aspects . Despite the surprisingly strong story , there 's a lot of immature and awkward dialogue that will cause you to roll your eyes , a minigame where you 'll use the Vita 's touchscreen to rub a girl 's body on rare occasions , and a ridiculous amount of attention focused on breasts in the dialogue and graphics . It does n't feel consistent with the characters , and that 's a shame . <p> Assuming that you can ignore these issues , the gameplay is interesting -- even though it may take you a while to get the hang of things . Streams of overwhelming instructions are thrown at you within the first couple of hours , and it 'll take you some time to understand everything . We already mentioned the conversations and how they work , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your disposal . You manage everything through a top-down view of your city , with a host of options to choose from . <p> For example , the Dorm Room is the place where you organise and manage technical stuff like equipping weapons and armour to your girl of choice and multiple Star Children . Your skills -- special moves typically performed with others -- can be checked , your party members can be switched out for new matchups , and you can make your offspring " independent " . This consequentially levels up the city to unlock new places like the Gift Shop or Guild , where you can find presents to give the girls and accept quests to take down specific enemies or find items in exchange for currency . <p> Meanwhile , the Academy is where you 'll spend a lot of your time talking to the characters -- primarily the seven girls . You 'll notice smiley faces around each one 's icon , which indicates their mood in response to how you interact with them . If you make one of them happy , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Besides choosing an option that gives a Star Child an increased stat sometimes , the only thing that you do here is watch a cutscene with a naked silhouette of the girl for a few seconds , and then choose which class your offspring will be : a Medic , Thief , Magician , etc . There are other classes , too , and these are revealed over time , and all play different roles on the battlefield . <p> Speaking of which , the real gameplay begins with Labyrinths : dungeons that you need to explore and fight through floor-by-floor until you reach their bosses . With your unique Star Children teams and female accomplice , you 'll use basic attacks , skills , and more strategies in the turn-based battles . There are also elemental attributes like wind , earth , and fire at play , which force you into thinking strategically about which party members to use . It does n't stop there : you can attack enemies from the front , left , right , or behind to yield more powerful attacks if you locate weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Multiple enemies can occupy the screen at once , so you 'll also need to spread yourself thin yet efficiently to deal with the threats . There are other wrinkles on top of this -- such as the Chain Drive and Intercept systems -- that add to the experience and contribute to its already unique identity . <p> Alas , it does suffer from some issues . While the battles seem surprisingly deep at first , they gradually begin to lose their novelty . There 's a good assortment of enemies to fight , but we could n't shake the feeling that the encounters felt too similar . We believe the difficulty is partly responsible for this , which is much easier than we anticipated . Despite the initial learning curve , we only died once during our first 15 hours of play , and we never really felt challenged , prompting us to make sloppy moves and still achieve victory . There 's some great complexity on display to be sure , but the breezy difficulty means that it 's never fully realised , which might leave you fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this anime-inspired game . In dungeons , you 'll be exploring 3D environments , and while these are generally dull and uninteresting , the character models themselves look great . It 's the dialogue scenes , however , that stand out the most . Vibrant , anime comic book-like cut outs of the characters are shown and act out simple body gestures and full facial expressions for most conversations , which helps to bring them to life . When you speak with the girls , they 're portrayed from the top-half -- of course -- with far more detailed models employed . Overall , the artstyle -- along with the game 's great costume aesthetics -- make it a visually solid release . <p> Unfortunately , the audio is a mix of both the exceptional and the mediocre . The music will catch your ears with beautiful orchestral pieces and catchy Daft Punk-esque techno tunes , but the audio fails to score during the " classmating " sequences and battles , with odd vocals and instruments that become more irritating over time . The voice acting is also fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Japanese dialogue is n't included . There are weak performances from several characters , but others are generally solid and wo n't have you searching for the mute button . <p> It 's also a good thing that this is a substantial affair . The game will take you about 25 hours to complete if you rush , but if you play at a slightly slower pace , you 'll certainly get in 35 or so hours . Unless you really enjoy the experience , we 'd argue that there 's not enough incentive to play through a second time , but your initial run should provide you with more than enough value for your money . <h> Conclusion <p> Conception II : Children of the Seven Stars is a strange title , but it offers an intriguing experience that 's let down by a few issues . Indeed , the bizarre story elements , off-putting sexual material , and repetitive gameplay mechanics may turn you away from this eccentric title , but look past these problems and you will find a way to appreciate its otherwise interesting narrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing their Japanese games .... in Japanese Like @NintendoNaut I prefer to have a Japanese audio track too which is why I stick mainly to niche Jrpgs as the likes of NISa are great as they provide dual audio ( original japanese audio &amp; a dubbed english one ) I tend to stick with the Japanese audio as thats the developers original work , and some aspects can get changed or lost during the translation . Persona 4 is a good example of this , as I watched the anime in Japanese &amp; then played P4G dubbed . I found the english dub on the game to be quite jarring with regards to how characters were potrayed due to how they came across from the translation/VA work . Some characters seemed a little too different to me . Localised games should always offer up that choice of audio , which is something Atlus rarely seem to do unfortunately <p> @Shellybird27 As @MadchesterManc said , I vastly prefer the original Japanese audio . I find English dubs to not only be " jarring " but just plain awful . In fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know where they get these guys , but dubs are always forced and emotionless . I played the demo , and this game is just the same . The fact that they have the JP voicework just done and sitting there , but wo n't let us have it is actually pretty infuriating . <p> @NintendoNaut Everyone is entitled to their own opinion , but yours is just plain ridiculous . Most dubs are very well done and sometimes pack an equal amount of , if not more emotion , than their subbed Japanese counterparts . <p> If you 've yet to hear a good dub , then you 're either purposefully avoiding them or have n't even attempted to give one a chance , because there are a plethora of very good dubs out there . I will admit that some dubs are pretty awful ( Fairy Tails Animax dub , etc. ) , but to say that all of them are " jarring , " " forced " or " emotionless .

I admit it can get repetetive , I see that , but as far as I have experienced so far , the game paces it very well - you clear a floor or two , head back to the town to regroup etc. and enjoy the novel/dating part , repeat . It does nt feel like anything lasts too long - as soon as I have enough of reading , I feel the game sends me back to fighting , and as soon as I grow a bit tired of fighting I get the chance to stop for a bit and do some dating/shopping The overall story might seem a bit shallow at the beginning , but the dialogue is quite strange and entertainingly well written so far , the characters seem likeable and the overall tune/atmosphere is - like stated in every review around the net - lighthearted and full of breast/chest jokes/sexual themes/jokes - as far as I can tell from having played it for about 10 hours now I can recommend it to every JRPG Fan that has a Vita - I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ATLUS to make a " Persona-like " ( from the overall style ) JRPG it cant be all that bad

It did not take too long for the Lucases to signal their competitive intent , the Woolmers ' team enjoying their first major success in the second-ever trophy at Guards - the Smiths Lawn Cup , in June 1955 . <p> Arthur and his wife , Ethel , both played . Ethel had also played county tennis , and had innate hand-eye co-ordination . But their love of the game passed on to their three children : son John , and daughters Pat and Claire . <p> John had four children , the boys Will and James taking up polo , while his daughters Annabel and Caroline took part in eventing . <p> Claire , who married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the army , had three children . Mark , Luke and Emma , all of whom have gone on to play at the highest level . <p> The Tomlinsons set up base at The Beaufort Polo Club , in many ways carrying on the work that Arthur began almost sixty years ago . Seven family members are currently registered with the HPA , but Arthur Lucas was the ' godfather ' . <p> Claire Tomlinson explained : " He used to ride from a very young age , and went hunting . He had a gap , went away and travelled abroad , the war came , and after returning , he started playing after the war . <p> There were always horses in the family , and they had always hunted . Many of the old photographs we have of my great-grandfathers , they are with horses at meets .

He would take 25 minutes to go through the forehand swing , I can remember my arm and shoulder wobbling . It was all done with love , though . " <p> " He was tough but had an amazing sense of humour . He was old school - and meticulous about it . As I understand it - he made three fortunes - and gave two away . The first he gave to his brothers and sisters , the second to his children , and he kept a third fortune for himself and granny . " <p> Stories and anecdotes are legion .

The move also drew a rule change out of the HPA , forbidding three Argentine players in high-goal teams . <p> Claire Tomlinson 's work ethic and love of the sport clearly comes from her parents - though she insists that it was late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never going to play . Even though I rode professional show ponies , I did n't play polo . Then , one day at Woolmers - I would have been in my late teens - they were a player short , and I was called on .

" <p> This involved a petition to the HPA - and by now , Arthur was an HPA steward . <p> " He was very supportive , but said I would have to do it on my own . He did not want to gang up and take sides . I got my petition signed by everybody - and thankfully it went through . " <p> The key to such success , nonetheless , had been the acquisition of Woolmers Park , in 1949 . In Arthur 's time , polo was even played on a ground in front of the estate 's main house .

" My mother and myself got it together after he died , " explained Claire Tomlinson . <p> Claire believes polo can be an addictive lifestyle . " You do n't want to stop once you are involved in it .

Mary ( Jessica Brown Findlay ) is in deep with the smuggling ring now after lying to the magistrate about what she knows . She longs for escape and confides in Francis Davey ( Ben Daniels ) but finds herself drawn more to Jem ( Matthew McNulty ) after a trip to Launceton market . Meanwhile , Joss ( Sean Harris ) is tormented by his nightmares and is taking it out on Mary 's aunt Patience ( Joanne Whalley ) . <p> The theme throughout this second episode is one of disguise ; each character is wearing their own mask and the episode strips these back one by one .

However , in other scenes , particularly those with Francis Davey , slow the pace to an almost glacial crawl which gives the episode an uneven pacing . <p> Perhaps the strongest example is Sean Harris ' Joss , a man haunted by his actions . Harris cuts an imposing yet tragic figure and the scene in which he confesses his occupation as a wrecker to Mary is a powerful one , again with its undercurrent of threatened violence . His relationship with Patience is also further examined ; this time both the audience and Mary bare witness to the violence that underlies it . Patience 's determination to remain with him despite this adds a tragic expansion to her character , continuing on from the first episode 's increased role for her .

It allows her to behave more freely with him than she would in her regular dress and it also ensures that Jessica Brown Findlay has a little more to do than look surly or depressed . The perils of acting with an accent mean that occasionally , Brown Findlay 's delivery of the dialogue comes across a little flat , particularly in her narration . The scenes in the market offer her a chance to explore other aspects of Mary 's character , but she is still the weak link in a strong cast . <p> These scenes at Launceton Market are a welcome change in tone , offering some levity to the proceedings . Matthew McNulty 's Jem is the perfect blend of roguish charm , showcased brilliantly as he sells a stolen horse back to his owner .

A piano section in the first episode called to mind John Carpenter 's Halloween theme , albeit briefly , and it has worked well with the visuals to continue the unsettling effect of Jamaica Inn . It works well alongside Philippa Lowthorpe 's direction , maintaining the grim atmosphere . <p> Whilst the focus is on developing the characters ' relationships in this episode , Frost also expands the story from beyond that of Daphne du Maurier 's novel .

Apart from a brief period in the 1970s , argues Todd , the British working class has been abandoned by successive governments for a century . She kicks off with the Insurance Acts of 1911 , which gave workers some protection against illness and unemployment , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welfare state . Todd describes a class growing in political confidence but up against the vested interest of an entrenched elite . Post-first world war promises of a new world were smashed by economic depression and unemployment and the old world came crashing back again : by 1931 , there were more girls employed as servants than there had been in 1900 . Through to the 1950s and visions of a New Jerusalem were blighted as the best social housing went to white-collar workers and the poorest were stranded on sink estates . Hope flickered in the 1970s but was dashed by Margaret Thatcher and her fight with the unions ; the working class has been living with that legacy ever since . <p> Todd 's argument is interwoven with interviews and autobiographical extracts to demonstrate how lives changed -- and also how they did not . She is very good on how the blandishments of consumer goods have become a substitute for real power ; she is also interesting on how the mid-century promotion of images of a working-class culture of dance halls , pubs , seaside holidays and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth of mass unemployment and poverty . Along the way , there are moments that jolt into life -- such as the description of hundreds queueing in the cold for a copy of the 1942 Beveridge Report . At intervals , the book recounts episodes in the life of Vivian Nicholson , who won the pools in 1961 and whose wild spending kept the tabloids agog until she was declared bankrupt in 1965 . <p> The People is impressively researched but it sweeps a lot of detail out of the way as it rushes past . Anecdotal examples seem often to have been squeezed to fit the author 's argument : the politics and motivations of the working-class Conservative-voter , for example , are barely touched on and viewed as a compass error . The middle class is not entirely the monolith of defensive self-interest that is described here . Individuals and their inconsistencies are not so easily cut to shape : Nicholson 's ricocheting fortunes sit awkwardly here when they are clearly intended to be representative of a wider picture . <p> A less tidily compartmentalised picture emerges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traces the lives of four generations of his family in a Yorkshire mining community . Benson , whose previous book The Farm ( 2005 ) , examined his father 's family through their farm , quotes as an epigraph the words of a former miner interviewed by Raphael Samuel in 1981 : " it 's this manner of carrying history , of awakening a deep curiosity in it , setting the starting blocks of learning , which is truly the miner 's history " . Benson 's book is a masterpiece of empathetic imagination , a narrative of refracted images , of stories told and retold through the generations , of tragedies , relationships , squabbles , disappointments , triumphs and secrets . <p> The Valley opens in 1907 in the mining village of Shirebrook , Derbyshire , where young Walter Parkin and his future wife Annie are attending a seance . We move with the Parkins to South Yorkshire , to the Dearne Valley , where the family still lives , and follow their descendants through wars , pit closures , industrial action and social changes both wide and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , through the memories of his uncle Gary and his wife , is searing . <p> His method is to look at events without judgment and from all angles so that each account feels prismatic rather than flat . He writes entirely without sentimentality and with exquisite tenderness -- but the book is underpinned by close research that puts individuals in their wider historical context . Spiritualism is a refrain through the generations ( as inevitable in the valley as socialism , is how one person remembers it ) ; a great uncle goes out for a drink to celebrate the birth of his baby and does n't return for three days ; a shiny new wireless and a picture of Dorothy Lamour sit next to a coal-fired grate ; a great grandmother wears a rosary made of Whitby jet . Selina Todd has written powerfully about young girls such as Benson 's grandmother Winnie , forced into domestic service during the depression of the 1930s . What Todd does n't mention is how often working-class parents such as Winnie 's refused to let their daughters work in factories or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's method of slipping between times and perspectives , sometimes appearing in his own narrative and sometimes standing outside it , would have been appreciated by the author Flora Thompson . In Lark Rise to Candleford , her celebrated account of a late-Victorian poor , rural childhood , published as three novels during the second world war when Thompson was already in her sixties , she employed these techniques herself . Thompson was a reticent figure -- what we know of her is gleaned from her fictional alter-ego Laura , through whose eyes we see life in the hamlet of Lark Rise . <p> Although her book won popular and critical acclaim , Thompson has over the years been consigned to that section of the library shelf marked " rural authenticity " . In Dreams of the Good Life , his new book about Thompson , Richard Mabey remarks that working-class writing is often , like outsider art , viewed as a thing of wonder : " We like the idea of a hedge-scribe -- whose words pour out as instinctively as birdsong . " The truth is that Thompson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , as so many accounts had it , an unsophisticated countrywoman married to a controlling husband who had burst into miraculous late-life song ; she was an ambitious working writer who , with effort and discipline , educated herself . Thompson 's is , writes Mabey , " a story of roots , aspiration and escape " . <p> She was born in 1876 in Juniper Hill in north Oxfordshire but spent much of her adult life as a postmistress in Hampshire . Thompson married a postal worker , became a career writer and had two sons . Born into the rural working class , she ended up , as Mabey puts it , a " class border-hopper " . She was an example of how education blurred the margins of class affiliation : she made friends through books , literary circles offering a space where social background mattered less than a passion for words . <p> Because Thompson 's trilogy was based so closely on her early life . it is impossible to read without feeling the weft of real experience . It is her close and unsentimental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people and custom , that makes Lark Rise so compelling . Her description of the " noisy , bloody " killing of a pig , for example , by a pig sticker working by the light of a lantern , is unsparingly vivid with its " mud and blood , flaring lights and dark shadows " . No detail of the way things look and feel escapes Thompson 's curiosity in material life . <p> Grayshott , the small Hampshire town where Thompson was postmistress at the turn of the last century , had become a commuter town by the 1890s , fringed by new villas . Cottage industries had by then been largely replaced by piecemeal waged labour and domestic service . Grayshott was also a centre for bohemians looking for the pastoral good life within easy reach of London . Edwardian urban intellectuals were avid for " folk " , for rural communities , songs , dances and stories , most of them at least part invented and tidied up , which spoke to a fractured industrial society of its archetypal primal past . It was a vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authentic natural living . <p> Mabey has many perceptive things to say about such historical moments , when British society hungers for the rural . Partly it is about maintaining social order : clog dancing being considered healthier for the working people than hanging around pubs , talking politics . But it is also about national identity , about rural life as the embodiment of a world worth saving . <p> Juniper Hill , the original Lark Rise , was , like so many communities , marked indelibly by the enclosure of common lands . In 1847 , Cottisford Heath , where the villagers grazed their cattle and collected firewood , was put under an enclosure order . The inhabitants of Juniper Hill tore down the enclosure notices and dumped the surveyor 's theodolite in the scrub . For six years they occupied the heath in squatter camps . <p> Margaret Willes ' excellent book The Gardens of the British Working Class demonstrates how enclosure was a defining point in the British attitude to land , community , self-reliance and ownership . Willes , author of several books on garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really takes off when the Enclosure Acts of the 18th century set in train a systematic destruction of strip cultivation in common ownership in order to maximise agricultural yield . <p> The plot of land became a symbol of resistance both for the dispossessed rural poor and paternalistic philanthropists . It was a keystone of the philosophies of the 19th-century Garden City movement and lay behind the ideal workers ' villages established by enlightened industrialists such as Lord Lever and Matthew Boulton . In the tradition of the 17th-century Diggers , who had built a squatter community on enclosed land in Weybridge , there were radical experiments in communal living on shared land by , for example , the Chartists at Heronsgate in Buckinghamshire and at the Whiteway colony in Gloucestershire . Industrial cities such as Sheffield and Nottingham were fringed with allotments , strip gardens and patches of cultivation , often given to their workers by factory owners , or simply claimed in patches between developments . <p> Willes writes fascinatingly of an upsurge of working-class gardening clubs that promoted gardening not only as a means of supplementing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competition and the beauty of flowers . An astonishing expertise in cultivation was the result : on windowsills , in soap boxes and in lightless courtyards . The gardens of the urban inner-city poor were gradually squeezed out by development and pollution during the mid-19th century and the middle-class suburbs , with their greenhouses and herbaceous borders , became the new home of the flower show and the horticultural club . <p> If there is a common theme underlying the recent cultural history of the working class , it might be the cultivation of these commonly owned pockets of land . They feature prominently in the mining villages of Richard Benson 's Dearne Valley and in the scrubby common of Flora Thompson 's Juniper Hill . The allotment , so often now consigned to the cosy suburbs , is in fact a potent symbol of defiance . <p> Lucy Lethbridge is author of ' Servants : A Downstairs View of Twentieth-century Britain ' ( Bloomsbury ) <p> Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2015 .

@@2456235 <h> RSC stages Arden of Faversham , by Anonymous <p> Generally , when theatre ? goers arrive at a Royal Shakespeare Company production , they know who wrote the play . The clue is embedded in the very name of the company . Not so with Arden of Faversham , which opens in Stratford-upon-Avon next week . The play is attributed to that most industrious of authors : Anonymous . Meanwhile , at the Lyric Hammersmith , in west London , Anonymous has become the writer-in-residence . Thanks to the venue 's current " Secret Theatre " season , audiences regularly take their seats with no idea what they are about to see , let alone by whom . <p> Anonymous , and her/his close associate , Traditional , have contributed countless songs , poems , paintings and dramas to world art , music and literature . When Arthur Quiller-Couch assembled poems for the first Oxford Book of English Verse , in 1900 , Lord Byron merited four entries and John Donne seven , but Anon clocked up an impressive 71 . And a name may not always reveal much : the designation Homer tells us little about who that was . Even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some quarters . But does it matter if the author of a play remains , by design or default , a mystery ? What difference does it make ? <p> Andy Kesson of the University of Roehampton , an expert in early modern authorship who has been liaising with the RSC on the origins of Arden of Faversham , points out that the idea of a named playwright ( and indeed artist or poet ) is a relatively new one . Arden , first printed in 1592 , is , he suggests , typical of its period . <p> " My starting position is that we do n't really know who wrote any of these plays , " he says . " The most likely answer is that it will have had several people working on it . The idea of a text with an ' author ' is quite alien to this period . " <p> To 21st-century audiences living in a celebrity-fixated age , this is a curious notion . Remaining anonymous is now so far from the norm that it brings its own kind of attention : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York last year there was debate over photographs claiming to have caught him in action . <p> Banksy , of course , belongs to those artists who have chosen anonymity , rather than had it thrust upon them by time or tradition . And he joins an illustrious list : novelists Walter Scott , Jane Austen and Charles Dickens are among those who initially hid their identity . Reticence can reveal much about a culture . Respectability may play a part ( particularly for female novelists ) , while legal and political reasons have prompted discretion among writers from Jonathan Swift and Alexander Pope to , more recently , Primary Colors author Joe Klein . <p> Some artists go incognito to try out a new style or test their reception . JK Rowling was furious when her own cloak of invisibility as the author of crime thriller The Cuckoo 's Calling was twitched aside in an exchange on Twitter ( although the revelation propelled the novel from relative obscurity to the top of book charts ) . And social media have introduced new opportunities for camouflage . An international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? . ? . Anonymous . <p> One impulse behind the hunt for the dramatist(s) of Arden of Faversham is the story itself . A black comedy about a pair of bungling assassins , it is based on a lurid true murder story from 1551 . It is unusual in being a domestic drama with a woman as its key protagonist . So who did write it ? <p> Kesson suggests that the list of most likely contributors includes Shakespeare , Christopher Marlowe , Thomas Kyd , John Lyly , Robert Greene and George Peele . Sophisticated computer analysis can pin down stylistic traits and word usage but Kesson suggests that this " only identifies a certain stage " in what was probably a multi-layered process . He adds that the play was written " on a cusp of the transition " towards contemporary ideas of authorship . <p> " There 's a big shift happening at the time Arden is being written , " he explains , " because of commercial theatre . You 've got a building to fill -- you need four or five new plays every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , over time , people become fascinated by who wrote these words . It really does change the notion of writing . " <p> Polly Findlay , directing the RSC revival , says that one scene , attributed by some to Shakespeare , has a different quality : " The rhythm hits a slightly different stride there and the kind of image that is employed feels bigger , more expansive , " she says . <p> Presumably , the actors who first performed Arden knew the person or people responsible . So does it frustrate a director reviving it today not to have definite recourse to authorship and biographical detail ? <p> Findlay found that it does subtly alter her engagement with the text . She explains that , in a Shakespeare work , it feels natural to track a character 's personal development through the play " maybe partly because you 're confident that it is the work of a single author . " In Arden of Faversham , however , characters are constantly doing illogical , 180-degree turns . The play 's provenance , she says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because you 're aware that it might be written by different people and , partly because it 's reflecting a mindset just before Shakespeare came in and changed the way that those dramatic structures worked , it makes you engage in a very different way , " she explains . " So , you 're not saying to actors -- as you would with any play written after about 1598 -- ' What did your character do in the last scene ? How does that inform what you 've done in this scene ? ' It forces you into a completely present-tense mindset . And the anonymity probably makes you feel that you 've got a greater degree of creative licence . " <p> Findlay worried at first that the play might feel disjointed but has , in fact , found working on it exhilarating : " It throws you back on having to make decisions with only the material which is readily available to hand ? . ? . ? . I think that makes for the most honest kind of creative environment . " <p> At the Lyric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship with the text , unmediated by preconceptions . The venue is about to stage its fifth show in the Secret Theatre season ( each play 's identity and author is revealed at the end of its performance ) . Sean Holmes , artistic director of the Lyric , says the experiment has encouraged a sense of adventure among audiences . <p> " It 's maybe harder to get people to come in the first place but , once they do , they really get it and value it , " he says . " We 've had much more repeat attendance than you would expect from a traditional season . " <p> Caroline Bird , who wrote the third show in the Lyric 's Secret Theatre season ( revealed to be called Chamber Piece ) , says she would definitely do it again . But she admits that there were challenges : " For the writer , it 's quite hard to work on something for six months and then not have the title on the ticket . And ' unnamed ' can suggest ' unfinished ' to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of your standpoint -- if you 're writing a satire for example -- which is both a good and a bad thing . " <p> Few audience members would want to gamble on an unknown quantity every time they step into a theatre . But in a world where star names sell plays , risking the odd brush with Anonymous can be invigorating . <p> " It 's great to have to evaluate why we go to theatre in the first place , " says Bird .

@@2461237 <h> Panasonic has just made its first profit for three years . And , says Matt Warman , it 's making a peerless , rugged laptop too <p> What was the last gadget that got you really , evangelically excited ? The iPhone ? The fabulous , gimmicky Parrot Drone ? In some ten years of writing about technology , I do n't think I 've ever been as keen to extol the virtues of any one product as the Panasonic CF-AX3 laptop . And I think few other products have attracted such attention from casual observers either . <p> In this age of tablets and smartphones , laptops are losing their lustre , so in part it 's the surprise that makes the AX3 appealing . Yes the Macbook Air is still fabulously thin , and Samsung 's Series 9 is n't far off a thing of beauty . But Sony 's dumping Vaio altogether , and Windows 8 , by common consent , is exciting far fewer people than the iPad . So what 's so special about the AX3 ? And why is it so hard to buy ? <p> It is , to start with a Panasonic Toughbook -- these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can stand being dropped from a decent height - 75cm - and can take a 100kg weight . While to some people it looks like ' my first laptop ' , to others it 's a superb , understated piece of design . Sadly , it 's aimed squarely at the business community , rather than the consumer , with a price to match . <p> It is , on a practical level , a Windows 8.1 Pro , 1080p touchscreen design with a flip-over hinge that means you can fold the screen all the way back and use it as a tablet . That 's a great but not unique combination . There 's a built-in sim card port , so you can have 4G internet wherever you go . And there are two batteries : one built-in with about 20 minutes charge so that you can ' hot-swap ' the other , main removable battery without turning the machine off . It is this combination that is as close to magic as modern computers get . <h> Related Articles <p> Are there faults ? That the keyboard is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's an Intel Core i5 rather than the faster i7 and the mouse can be slightly temperamental , but aside from that this is an always connected , usually well-batteried , great looking 12 " laptop that weighs just 1.135kg . There are lighter laptops out there , but not by much . <p> If you need a Windows laptop , I 've found the AX3 provides everything I need in a small and rugged package . Useful features , missing from the Macbook Air for instance , include a full-size Ethernet port and a VGA port for a conventional monitor . The SD card slot , HDMI port and two USB ports for charging even when it 's off mean there 's very little I ca n't do with it . It runs Office and Adobe Creative Cloud in every way I need it to with no bother.That battery life means I 've got a single spare battery and little hesitation now about taking short trips without even a power adapter . It 's a proper laptop in a way that even Microsoft 's own Surface is n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarkable about the AX3 is that it 's the first machine that 's really made me feel Windows 8.1 is simply better than all its predecessors : because it 's always connected to the web , the operating system works and its live tiles always display relevant , up-to-date information . And the touchscreen means I largely used Windows 8 as it should be used , scrolling up and down web pages with a finger rather than a keyboard . And I do n't worry about breaking it . There still are n't enough apps , but never mind . <p> This may not be the most beautiful laptop in the world , but put simply it just works and it can stand up to the tough treatment of real life . The only disaster is that as a business-focused machine it 's not available on the mass market . Youc a n't even get it on Amazon .

The studio weighed the workload of optimising Magma Chamber for public consumption against public interest , and decided to walk away . <p> As one Riot staffer now points out : " there 's more to creating a map than simply , well , creating a map " . <p> " Before I joined Riot and while I was new at Riot , I definitely wondered why there were n't more maps , " wrote Riot engineering manager J.

It 's first to drop a turret , reach 100 creep/minion kills or to simply achieve 2 kills . <p> This meant that in most games , due to the fact that you lose just by simply dying twice ( Or you and your partner die once each ) you 'd play carefully . It ended up as nothing more than a retarded contest of " last hits " on the enemy team 's minions , first to hit 100 . Boring as hell . If they simply removed the minion count limit and 2 deaths to lose , it would have been way more popular than 3v3 currently is . <p> This whole " Splitting the player-base " crap was the same reason 3v3 was destroyed in the first place .

Additional delay would amount to " a violation of the process of this court " . <p> Lee Adams , a solicitor advocate with the legal firm Hughmans who represented four of the defendants , said : " This decision is entirely unprecedented .

My brother has made arguments on behalf of his clients and the judge has made a decision . " <p> Commenting on the collapsed fraud trial , Sadiq Khan , the shadow justice secretary , said : " Because of justice secretary 's Chris Grayling 's legal aid changes , a judge has been forced to abandon a serious fraud trial because he could n't guarantee the defendants a fair trial . <p> " Thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this aborted trial , and this decision shows judges also have lost confidence in the justice secretary .

The government has made sure that the Public Defender Service has a number of suitably qualified advocates who could act in this case . " <p> Lawyers say those fees are halved , however , when VAT , chambers ' costs and other expenses are included . <p> In the case stayed at Southwark , known as R vs Crawley and Others , Alexander Cameron QC represented the defendants on a pro bono basis , arguing that they could not receive a fair trial and that the case should be stopped for good rather than merely adjourned . <p> Leonard , who has just finished hearing the Max Clifford case at Southwark crown court , ruled that there was no realistic prospect of sufficiently highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until early next year . <p> Although barristers have abandoned their courtroom walkouts in protest against more widespread cuts in criminal legal aid following a deal with the Ministry of Justice , they have continued boycotting VHCCs -- usually complex frauds involving thousands of pages of evidence . <p> Leonard 's ruling will put pressure on Grayling , who has pushed through deep legal aid cuts in the face of fierce opposition from the legal profession . The FCA , which brought the prosecution , is considering appealing against the decision . <p> VHCCs represent less than 1% of all crown court cases . Proportionately they impose a huge cost on the legal aid budget . One recent trial cost ? 8.5m ; the bill from the three most expensive VHCC cases in 2011-12 was ? 21m . <p> The judge said : " The knock-on effect on other trials , the waste of court resources and the need to disregard the criminal procedure rules designed to protect the court system from abuse , and to ensure scarce resources are used to best effect for all , in my judgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be granted . <p> " There is no realistic prospect that sufficient advocates would be available for this case to be tried in January 2015 from any of the sources available to the defence .

" <p> That delay in bringing the defendants to justice was also likely to breach their right to a fair trial under the European convention on human rights , he added . <p> Philip Smith , a solicitor with the law firm Tuckers who represented the fifth defendant , had contacted Alexander Cameron and asked if he would take on the case arguing for the trial to be stayed . Cameron lent his services free of charge . <p> " It 's a staggering decision , " Smith said . " It 's a very brave decision but a just one .

@@2468239 <h> A gripping account of how football captured a nation <p> Brazil is the sixth largest nation and boasts the seventh largest GDP . But , argues David Goldblatt in his new footballing history of the country , it " has barely registered its presence globally " . <p> This is an overstatement , but the general thesis is sound : notwithstanding its recent economic rise , Brazil has underperformed on the global stage . No Brazilian has won a Nobel Prize . The country 's literary output remains undervalued , its film industry underwhelming , its cuisine marginalised . Even the nation 's " once hegemonic position in coffee production has been eroded . Starbucks serves cappuccino not cafezinho . " <p> And yet there is one area of human endeavour in which Brazil consistently excels . Just consider those famous yellow shirts , the five World Cup successes . Brazil is synonymous with football . The country is also , you might add , associated with gun violence , political corruption , sprawling favelas , natural beauty and sexual freedom . <p> Little surprise , then , that bloodshed and fraud , as well as booze , glamour , poverty and sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrative that begins when an Englishman named Charles Miller introduced football to the S ? o Paulo Athletic Club in the 1890s . Rowing and horse racing were the order of the day ; cricket an occasional diversion . But despite some early misgivings -- " a bunch of maniacs , " said one newspaper ; " a blind and barmy battle , " concluded another -- football fever quickly settled in . <p> Goldblatt has little to say about why it was football rather than , say , cricket that gripped the nation , but he is thorough in his appraisal of its spread . A rash of clubs emerged , reflecting the population 's cosmopolitan character ( Hespanha , Portuguesa , Syrio , Palestra It ? lia ) , and by the First World War tens of thousands of spectators were turning up for matches . Professionalisation soon followed and a nascent national team united a diverse demographic around a single entity , though there was to be no room for black players at the 1921 Copa Am ? rica . This racism was echoed three decades later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Brazil led to the scapegoating of the team 's black contingent ; the disappointing campaign in Switzerland four years later prompted the authors of the " official report " to blame " genetics itself " . <p> Goldblatt is an impressive cultural historian and his focus is firmer on the sociopolitical backdrop than on the game itself -- which can make Futebol Nation a depressing book . Along with the feats of Pel ? , the tortured genius of Garrincha and the recent promise of Neymar , we are confronted with a tale of bigotry , misconduct , megalomania , deceit , murder and charlatanism . Unlike in Italy , say , where cheating has tended to mean match fixing , Brazilian football 's con tricks are rather more grandiose : time and again the rules of the Campeonato have been retrospectively altered or inferior clubs spuriously penalised in order to prevent the big boys from going down . This most recently occurred at the end of last season when Fluminense were saved from relegation at the cost of Portuguesa , harshly docked four points for accidentally fielding a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country 's wider record of football-related disgrace . All nations have their shadowy brown envelopes ; the massive financial stakes and skimpy regulation are a breeding ground for sleaze . But Brazil 's history seems more villainous than most . <p> Goldblatt introduces us to a host of fishy schemes and schemers , many of them reprised from the passages on Brazil in his global history of football , The Ball Is Round ( 2006 ) . Now added to the tales of opportunistic dictators ( General M ? dici called football " the highest form of patriotism " ) , shady club presidents and horrific fan violence is an eruption of fresh scandal in the lead-up to this summer 's World Cup . <p> There is Ricardo Teixeira , the former president of the Brazilian Confederation of Football , and his father-in-law , the former Fifa president Jo ? o Havelange , described last year by Fifa 's Adjudicatory Chamber as " morally reproachable " after evidence of kickbacks . There are the unbuilt stadiums , dubious allocation of host cities , public discontent ( " a bus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in January " ) and detested reconstruction of the Maracan ? in Rio , with its abundant executive boxes and paucity of cheap seating : " A vast investment of public money had been used to exclude the public , " Goldblatt remarks . <p> Brazil , the author argues , has generally managed to recover from such outrages through a combination of popular inertia ( not , it must be noted , currently apparent in its troubled urban streets ) and pacifying on-field virtuosity . The performance of the Sele ? ? o next month will have wider ramifications than merely sporting ones . This is , after all , a nation whose media eclipsed reports of the Apollo 12 moon landing with news of Pel ? ' s 1,000th goal . <p> Futebol Nation comes with its frustrations -- Goldblatt can be too dogged in his cultural contextualisations , too partisan in his criticisms of the authorities , and there are occasional oddities of translation -- but he has done the important work well .

The good news , though , is that the end of QE will ultimately be beneficial for small businesses and the middle class . <p> Since the Fed began scaling back the size of its monthly asset purchases earlier this year , commercial lending has increased . As economist David Malpass recently pointed out , " Growth was weak in 2009-13 but jumped to a 16% annual rate in the first quarter , when the taper started . " The Fed plans to gradually diminish its monthly asset purchases until finally ending them in 2015 , just as the new long-term inflation cycle will kick off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a new 60-year cycle . Assuming the Fed sticks to its stated intention , there will be little counter-cyclical interference with the new long-term cycle ( unlike the one that 's ending this year ) . That means there will be more opportunity for the cycle to play out and extend its benefits throughout the broad economy , not just the financial sector . <p> With a new inflationary cycle ahead of us , the end of QE should be a positive since banks will no longer have a reason to curtail lending . Although there will be many benefits to this new cycle ahead of us , there will also be some serious challenges as well . One of them we looked at in my previous commentary , viz. the problem of high retail food and fuel prices . <p> As previously pointed out , in a normal inflation/deflation cycle the transition from deflation to inflation would ordinarily be a gradual progression over a 10-15 year period . In the U.S. , however , years of artificially high retail food and fuel prices will short-circuit this process . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decline in the last five years , the increase in the cost of living could be dramatic in the years immediately following the 2014 cycle bottom . This would obviously serve as a hindrance for the middle class , although it will likely be somewhat mitigated by rising wages and increasing employment opportunities . <p> To what extent increasing food and fuel prices will create problems in the nascent inflationary cycle is anyone 's guess at this point . Combined with an increasing tax and regulatory burden ( e.g. Obamacare ) for consumers and small businesses , higher retail prices could act as a drag on the anticipated economic growth of the new up-cycle in the years following 2014 . <p> Another potential problem for wind down of QE is the problem of " zombie credits . " This is the term bond manager Bonnie Baha has used to describe the bonds issued by corporations with questionable net worth and unsustainable business models . These companies , many of them in the retail sector , have been largely unprofitable in recent years due to the demise of the bricks-and-mortar shopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet these " walking dead " companies survived in large part thanks to the Fed 's unlimited stimulus program of recent years . <p> Baha believes that these zombie companies are the consequence of the Fed 's QE program , which in her words " has essentially allowed the U.S. to defer , if not entirely skip , a normal default cycle in which troubled companies are culled from the marketplace . " She suggests , however , that the ending of QE could stop these zombies " dead in their tracks " and cautions yield investors to be alert for zombie credits in their portfolios . <p> Returning to our main theme , I 've included the following graph which was originally printed in the late P.Q. Wall 's newsletter . This graphic depicts the various " seasons " of the long-term 60-year cycle as it pertains to the phases of the economy . It also shows the basic divisions and sub-divisions of the inflation/deflation cycle . We 're currently approaching the end of " winter " and will soon be entering " spring . " <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-term cycle . Again it is from one of P.Q. Wall 's old newsletters . This graph is a good representation of the the 60-year cycle and its four 15-year phases . P.Q. 's prediction that interest rates would bottom out in 2013 , which he initially made back in the 1990s , was remarkably prescient . <p> Kress Cycles <p> Cycle analysis is essential to successful long-term financial planning . While stock selection begins with fundamental analysis and technical analysis is crucial for short-term market timing , cycles provide the context for the market 's intermediate- and longer-term trends . <p> While cycles are important , having the right set of cycles is absolutely critical to an investor 's success . They can make all the difference between a winning year and a losing one . One of the best cycle methods for capturing stock market turning points is the set of weekly and yearly rhythms known as the Kress cycles .

The hit parade is not exactly littered with Mexican instrumental acoustic duos who delight in energetically plucked tributes to historical figures including Fyodor Dostoyevsky , Norwegian polar explorer Fridtjof Nansen and Eleanor of Acquitane . But then , who knows what direction the next Justin Bieber album will take ? <p> This is specialist stuff , surely , so what are the pair doing so right ? " It is surprising , " admits Rodrigo Sanchez , 40 , who is now considered such a major figure in Mexican culture that he and Gabriela Quintero played a White House concert at a meeting between Barack Obama and the last Mexican President , Felipe Calder ? n . Obama told them he had their music on his iPod ; Calder ? n did n't know who they were . " It 's a different proposal but people were ready to open up to dfferent ideas , " Says Sanchez . <p> " I had a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something that I 'm not , " adds Quintero , also 40 , in a singsong voice that leaves no doubt that English is not her first language . " I ca n't write a friendly radio song . That requires a certain talent . We are not gon na try to be something else -- we are this . " <p> Theirs would certainly be a tough blueprint for copycats to follow . Having begun their music career in the early Nineties in a heavy metal band , Tierra Acida ( " Acid Land " ) , in Mexico City , they moved to Dublin at the start of the last decade to busk as a duo . They started covering hard rock songs in a raw Latin style , including Led Zeppelin 's Stairway to Heaven and Metallica 's Orion , both of which appeared on their first proper album , a self-titled release from 2006 . It was a number one in Ireland , and their popularity swelled to other countries from there . <p> They strum with violence , their melodies snaking around each other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And that 's it . No singing , no drums , bass or electric instruments . " We 've always done exactly the opposite of everyone else , " says Quintero . If it sounds simple , you need to see them live , where fingers blur , feet stamp and the pace and intricacy of their work is almost unfathomable . At their big concerts there are no dancing girls , costume changes or fireworks -- the real special effects are the cameras that capture their fiery fingerwork in extreme close-up . <p> They 've become a big-time band through word of mouth , not media attention . " We 're not a radio band , but we have played a lot . We develop fanbases just by playing and playing , " says Sanchez . He 's an earnest , smiley guy who 's long since tidied his heavy metal hairdo , a passionate vegan ( as is Quintero ) who runs for fun and swaps recipe tips with his mate , the American ultrarunning legend Scott Jurek . <p> Although the duo are n't big in Latin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes to flamenco-style guitar sounds , these days Sanchez lives in Barcelona and Quintero is based in Ixtapa on Mexico 's west coast . They were a couple but split up two years ago . Thankfully , the working relationship has continued . " We have a really good relationship . Much better actually , " says Sanchez . <p> " I do n't know how we managed to do it , " says Quintero of touring as romantic as well as musical partners . " We fought all the time . But music was one of those things that we could agree on . " <p> United about their musical direction , they 've managed to resist any thoughts of adding lyrics or dance beats to their potent but minimal mix . So they 've had to find different ways of progressing . Their last album , 2012 's Area 52 , saw them revisiting their earlier songs with a Cuban orchestra . They also worked with Hans Zimmer on the soundtrack to the fourth Pirates of the Caribbean movie , On Stranger Tides . Now they 've given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dead Alive , some heavyweight subject matter , dedicating them to eight figures they deem to be of historical importance -- four men , four women . The ninth song , Torito , is named after a Mexican cocktail . <p> You may not hear immediately what the Chilean poet Gabriela Mistral has to do with the haunting notes of Megalopolis , or why explorer Fridtjof Nansen is the subject of Fram 's rapidfire strumming . Rodrigo y Gabriela chose their subjects after the songs were recorded , so they 're not directly related to the music , but it 's enough for the duo that you might look them up afterwards and learn something about eight significant lives . <p> " It 's just part of what we do as part of our expression . We want to make it speak to us on a personal level . Particularly in my own imagination , the music we play is very visual .

But thankfully for those who have n't read any Dostoyevsky , it 's very good music indeed . <h> The strangest full houses in town <p> Rodrigo y Gabriela are far from the only musical oddities selling out massive shows . Elvis was obviously a major concert draw for decades but that was when he was alive . Now the band is real but the star is a projection , singing and bantering in footage lifted from televised concerts . If you 're used to watching the big screen from the back of an arena , it feels surprisingly normal . <p> You 'll never hear this Boston-formed band 's uncool mix of prog and metal on the radio , yet they played Wembley Arena two months ago and are high on the bill at the Sonisphere rock festival this summer . Solo piles upon solo in sets of up to three-and-a-half hours . <p> Never mind the songs in the pop charts , what a large number of concert goers apparently want to hear is the soundtrack to Sonic the Hedgehog . An orchestra plays the memorable themes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Legend of Zelda and Halo , and even accompanies audience members having a go at some arcade classics on stage . <p> If you got to the end of the year thinking , " Hey , how come I have n't been to more Belgian rap shows ?

Now he 's written Belgium 's World Cup song and is playing this 5,000-capacity venue . <p> One of the biggest-selling albums of all time is also one of the weirdest , a two-disc orchestral prog take on HG Wells 's classic sci-fi tale . In what 's billed as its last arena tour , it will feature an unlikely cast in Jason Donovan , Brian McFadden from Westlife , X Factor alumni Shayne Ward and Joseph Whelan and a holographic Liam Neeson. 
@@2484231 <p> Anyone for the poetry of doomed youth ? Thankfully the angst is at a minimum in Gia Coppola 's directorial debut . Palo Alto is adapted from a short story collection by James Franco in which he made fitful record of his own high-school flirtations with the edge . Like his art , most of Franco 's misbehavior was experimental in nature , poised somewhere between attention-getting and boredom -- public intoxication , pot , car-jacking , drunk-driving -- and the stiffest penalty his teenage alter ego incurs is community service at a local old folks ' home . <p> Wisely , the 27-year-old Coppola has honored the half-heartedness of his drift into semi-oblivion . Her film is less a portrait of a generation in trouble , more a generation toying lazily with the idea of getting into trouble . It 's about teenage drift , the sunken torpor of late summer afternoons , the sun casting almost horizontal shadows across largely empty parking lots that seem to cry out for something to happen . It 's about the blank spaces in teenage heads and lives , and what they do to fill them . <p> Emma Roberts plays April , one her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unrequited crush on Teddy ( Jack Kilmer ) . Teddy is a mop-haired stoner who , together with his friend Fred ( Nat Wolff ) , is busy ingesting whatever substance the pair can lay their hands on , strapping fireworks to the backs of their skateboards , and other such pressing Euclidean experiments . The film begins with the two boys in a car , tying themselves in knots with a series of historical what-if 's before accelerating into a wall , whooping it up afterwards like Butch and Sundance . You get the spirit of their disaffection -- " Where are we going ? " " Fucking nowhere " -- but you also get the stuntedness of their rebellion : the run-up between car and wall was about three feet . They were parked in a car lot .

She 's too cool for wake-up calls or alarm bells . The drunken disports at a party are treated to a burst of slow-motion -- thrashing heads , fountains of rum punch -- the images riding a knife-edge between the glorious and the grotesque , but the kicker is the aftermath .

She could easily be one of the suburban sphinxes from The Virgin Suicides , but for the vividness of her reactions . Hurt when Teddy absconds for a blow job with someone else , April retreats to her room to practice imaginary brush-offs -- " I do n't care ... Whatever ...

Franco seems to delight in playing sketchy dudes on the fringes of dramas about teen disaffection ; playing villain in his own short story collection doubtless appealed to his voluminous sense of irony . April 's eventual surrender to him is dramatized with a terrific understanding for the role sex plays in teenagers ' lives , somewhere between self-exploration and power-play : sucked under by a bad day , April asserts herself the only way she can think of , by sleeping with teacher . <p> Roberts is the standout . Away from her , the film drifts and drags , and some of the image-making is rote : hands playing dolphin out of moving car windows , cascading hair on a summer 's day , and I could have done without the dead plants in the office of the school counselor , as if to spell out her lack of green fingers ( would you trust this woman with your psychological development ? ) . All of the adults in the film are tried and found guilty of ulterior motives and wayward agendas : an art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dad ( Val Kilmer ) and a mom whose concern for her daughter is limited to a single , repeated " Are you depressed ?

Big shocker . But Coppola seems to have sensed the slightness at the heart of these stories and , with that lack of humbug that is the prerogative of novice directors , has not done anything to cover for it . Someone with more ego at stake might have been tempted to make more of a " statement " . But the slightness is what 's interesting about these lives , which have been limned gracefully by the 27-year-old director . The green fingers are hers .

@@2484238 <p> Headlines around the worldtrumpeted a watershed moment for the global economy last week . As the Financial Times put it : " China poised to pass US as world 's leading economic power this year . " This is a startling development -- or it would be if the claim were not essentially wrong . In fact , the US remains the world 's largest national economy by a substantial margin . <p> The story was based on the 29 April release of a report from the World Bank 's International Comparison Program ( ICP ) . The ICP 's work is extremely valuable . I eagerly await and use their new estimates every six years or so , including to look at China . <p> The ICP data compare countries ' GDP using purchasing-power-parity ( PPP ) exchange rates , rather than market rates . This is the right thing to do when looking at real ( inflation-adjusted ) income per capita in order to measure people 's living standards . But it is the wrong thing to do when looking at national income in order to measure the country 's weight in the global economy . <p> The bottom line is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at PPP exchange rates ) or aggregate GDP ( at market rates ) -- the day when China surpasses the US remains in the future . This in no way detracts from the country 's impressive growth record , which , at about 10% per year for three decades , constitutes a historical miracle . <p> At market exchange rates , the American economy is still almost double the size of China 's ( 83% larger , to be precise ) . If the Chinese economy 's annual growth rate remains five percentage points higher than that of the US , with no significant change in the exchange rate , it will take another 12 years to catch up in total size . If the differential is eight percentage points -- for example , because the yuan ( renminbi ) appreciates at 3% a year in real terms -- China will surpass the US within eight years . <p> The **31;103;TOOLONG issue is familiar to international economists . This annoying but unavoidable technical problem arises because China 's output is measured in yuan , while US income is measured in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers so that they are comparable ? <p> The obvious solution is to use the contemporaneous exchange rate -- that is , multiply China 's yuan-measured GDP by the dollar-per-yuan exchange rate , so that the comparison is expressed in dollars . But then someone points out that if you want to measure Chinese citizens ' standard of living , you have to take into account that many goods and services are cheaper there . A yuan spent in China goes further than a yuan spent abroad . <p> For this reason , if you want to compare per capita income across countries , you need to measure local purchasing power , as the ICP does . The PPP measure is useful for many purposes , such as knowing which governments have succeeded in raising their citizens ' standard of living . <p> Looking at per capita income , even by the PPP measure , China is still a relatively poor country . Though it has come very far in a short time , its per capita income is now about the same as Albania 's -- that is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But Albania 's economy , unlike China 's , is not often in the headlines . That is not only because China has such a dynamic economy , but also because it has the world 's largest population . Multiplying a middling per capita income by more than 1.3 billion " capita " yields a big number . The combination of a large population and a medium income gives it economic power , and also political power . <p> Similarly , we consider the US the No1 incumbent power not just because it is rich . If per capita income were the criterion by which to judge , Monaco , Qatar , Luxembourg , Brunei , Liechtenstein , Kuwait , Norway , and Singapore would all rank ahead of the US . ( For the purposes of this comparison , it does not matter much whether one uses market exchange rates or PPP rates . ) If you are shopping for citizenship , you might want to consider one of those countries . <p> But we do not consider Monaco , Brunei , and Liechtenstein to be among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are so small . What makes the US the world 's leading economic power is the combination of its large population and high per capita income . <p> It is this combination that explains the widespread fascination with how China 's economic size or power compares to America 's , and especially with the question of whether the challenger has now displaced the long-reigning champion . But PPP exchange rates are not the best tool to use to answer that question . <p> The reason is that when we talk about an economy 's size or power , we are talking about a broad range of questions -- and a broad range of interlocutors . From the viewpoint of multinational corporations , how big is the Chinese market ? From the viewpoint of global financial markets , will the yuan challenge the dollar as an international currency ? From the viewpoint of the International Monetary Fund and other multilateral agencies , how much money can China contribute , and how much voting power should it get in return ? From the viewpoint of countries with rival claims in the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> For these questions , and most others involving total economic heft , the indicator to use is GDP at market exchange rates , because what we want to know is how much the yuan can buy on world markets , not how many haircuts or other local goods it can buy back home . And the answer to that question is that China can buy more than any other country in the world -- except the US . <p> Jeffrey Frankel is Professor of Capital Formation and Growth at Harvard University .

@@2492231 <h> Rob Woodward on the launch of STV 's local channels <h> Rob Woodward hopes the identity Glaswegians hold so dear will make local TV a winner . Picture : John Devlin <h> KRISTY DORSEY <p> IT 'S Thursday morning , and some 40 delegates from the Glasgow Chamber of Commerce are about to become the first outsiders to get a look at the set of The Riverside Show , the flagship programme of STV 's forthcoming city television station . <p> The interview lounge is meant to look like a typical riverside flat , but the custom-made sofas sit higher than normal so presenters and guests are best-framed by the views from the windows behind . Jennifer Reoch and David Farrell will be backed by the SSE Hydro , while guests on the daily magazine programme are flanked by the Squinty Bridge . <p> The aim is to underscore the unabashed focus on local news , both by the programme and the station as a whole . The feeling is that nothing will say " live from Glasgow " better than these iconic backdrops . <p> It 's all part of chief executive Rob Woodward 's campaign to build a more " intimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as " consumers " of the content his company now supplies across a variety of platforms .

STV Glasgow , for example , will be interactive from day one and draw upon resources from other parts of the group 's " digital family " . <p> " In the past there was really only one way to consume our content , and that was at home , " he says .

Almost half of all player views are via a mobile device , and Woodward says that number will continue to rise . <p> If anything , it would seem that STV is capitalising from the rising online tide which many predicted would erode the traditional market for broadcasting . <p> " In fact , the opposite is happening because what people are actually doing is engaging with our content through these social media platforms , " Woodward says . <p> The lines will be further blurred as STV Glasgow takes online offerings such as Bit Socket -- the Glasgow-based video games comedy -- to the airwaves .

Pruzzo restored parity as the game approached half-time and the two sides continued to trade blows , none of which fatal , in what ended as a goalless second half .

@@2492240 <h> Ezine <h> Dietary minerals <p> Toothpaste can possibly raise the risk of getting urinary stones . That 's the rather troubling finding of a new ion chromatography method for determining fluoride concentrations in the stones . <p> Urinary stones are small crystal particles that can form anywhere in the urinary system , from the kidneys to the the bladder . They are produced when the urine becomes saturated with dietary minerals , especially calcium and magnesium , which then form crystals . This saturation can result from the ingestion of large quantities of these minerals in foods or from the urine becoming highly concentrated due to dehydration . <p> In many cases , these stones do n't cause any real problem , being passed out in the urine before they grow too big . If they do become too big , however , then they can cause pain and discomfort , and either needed to be broken up with techniques such as ultrasound or surgically removed . <p> Although calcium and magnesium compounds , particularly calcium oxalate , are the main components of most urinary stones , they can also contain a wide range of other compounds , including uric acid , cystine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urinary stone can help to reveal how it formed in the first place , and thus how to prevent any more urinary stones forming in the future . <h> Ion interference <p> While several techniques are available for detecting the major components of urinary stones , they are n't always sensitive enough to detect many of the minor compounds , such as fluorides . Now , however , chemists from Russia and Australia , led by Pavel Nesterenko at the University of Tasmania , have shown that ion chromatography ( IC ) can form the basis for just such a sensitive technique , able to detect fluoride anions at concentrations as low as 0.004mg/L . <p> First though , they had to deal with a couple of potential sources of interference . For a start , before they can be analysed by IC , the urinary stones have to be dissolved in a strong acid such as hydrochloric acid ( HCL ) . Unfortunately , the high concentration of anions in the acid tend to mask the minor anions released from the urinary stone . <p> To minimize this problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HCL needed to dissolve stones of a particular weight . They also worked out the shortest amount of time needed for the acid to release the fluorides from the stone , which turned out to be around 20 minutes . In this way , they were able to reduce the amount of time and acid needed for this step , and thus the associated interference , to a bare minimum . <h> High fluoride concentrations <p> Another source of interference , however , are the major components of urinary stones , particular calcium and magnesium cations , which can react with anions during IC to form compounds that precipitate out of solution . To deal with this potential source of interference , Nesterenko and his colleagues simply added a cation exchange resin to the solution , which soaked up all the calcium and magnesium cations . They then removed the resin by filtration , taking all the calcium and magnesium cations with them . <p> Using these two approaches to remove any potential interference , Nesterenko and his team then analysed 20 urinary stones taken from patients at a Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fluoride ions in 80% of the stones , at concentrations of 0.01 -- 4.0mg per gram of stone . <p> The vast majority of the stones contained very small concentrations of fluorides , below 0.1mg per gram of stone , but two of the stones had fluoride concentrations above 0.5mg . This indicates that the formation of these stones may have been promoted by high concentrations of fluorides in the patients ' urine , perhaps due to the patients ingesting lots of water containing added fluoride or even lots of fluoride toothpaste. 
@@2497230 <h> After a faltering start , Agents Of SHIELD delivered a satisfying season finale that 's sure to have viewers coming back for more ... <p> This review contains spoilers . <p> 1.22 Beginning Of The End <p> A breakneck finale stuffed with plot and character moments that actually make sense . If you 'd told me that 's how Agents Of SHIELD would be concluding after the series nadir that was the mid-season cliffhanger , The Bridge , I 'd scarcely have believed you . But here we are . There was a lot to get through and virtually all of the series ' ongoing plots got touched on in some form or another . <p> Whether he was involved in the writing or not , one could sense Whedon 's influence on this script in a way that has n't been seen since the pilot . The way everyone undercut Garrett 's supervillain rants was sublime , and the opening scene introduced Cybertek 's headquarters and set up the stakes for the conclusion with low-key brilliance . Even Garrett 's final exit was , tonally , more like something from Buffy than Agents Of SHIELD , which is no bad thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappointing to see the backpedalling of Ward start even before the series had ended , although to be fair they 've kept his evil somewhat ambiguous . " We were never true believers , " he says , as if laying the groundwork for an inevitable return to the SHIELD fold . Because he and Garrett were never proper Nazis , they were just in it for the " symbiosis " of saving ward . <p> That does beg the question of whether it 's better to be ideologically evil or so amoral you 'll get into bed with literal Nazis to achieve your goals , but that 's beside the point . Let 's be clear : the last thing I want to see is a rehabilitated Ward . Of course he 'll be back next series , but let it be as a villain , not as a repentant prodigal son . <p> At least Ward followed through for the remainder of the episode , giving Skye and May the moments they needed to resolve their issues with him . Both had been tricked into caring for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so it 's fitting that they got to orchestrate his downfall . As predicted , we got a big moment for Mike Peterson too . It 's as happy an ending as we could 've hoped for , and there 's finally a superhero out there that Agents Of SHIELD can use on their own terms . <p> Not everyone got a happy ending , though . Fitz and Simmons had their moment , and while his unrequited love did n't quite get requited , at least Fitz got his moment to be a hero . One does wonder what actually happened to Fitz , though . Hopefully it 's not one of a genre TV 's staples , a coma of convenience , but on the other hand given the show 's earlier form I 'm not entirely sure I want to see AoS grappling with anything more nuanced . <p> Even I ca n't complain about Nick Fury 's staggeringly convenient appearance , if only because it finally made Agents Of SHIELD feel like it was taking place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe instead of some offshoot cul-de-sac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance was definitely not a gratuitous cameo -- only he 's got the authority ( at least in Coulson 's eyes ) to hand Coulson his new task and title . And that , at least , will make an interesting arc if they run with it in any serious way . <p> And there 's still so much to think about . The return of Agent Koenig ( sort of ) was hugely welcome , though I find myself hoping he 's not a twin brother so much as a standard-issue Life Model Decoy . In terms of plot threads left dangling , we got a good few : Raina 's future , Skye 's parentage , and what 's inside Coulson 's brain . The next series of SHIELD is largely ( if not entirely ) going to take place between Guardians Of The Galaxy and Avengers : Age Of Ultron , so it 'll be a surprise if some or all of these mysteries are n't connected to the big releases . Indeed , there are aliens in the former and Hydra in the latter . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's fair to say that the series delivered a satisfying conclusion after a faltering start .

In that , it 's achieved something .

" <p> In a report published today , an all-party committee of MPs said the Government should issue separate statistics about fraud and error on different days so that the media could not imply that mistakes made in paying benefits were fraudulent claims . <p> Pressure groups have accused ministers of portraying people living on social security as " skivers " and contrasting them with " hard-working " families who get up early to go to work . <p> The Work and Pensions Select Committee said the estimated rate of fraud is 0.7 per cent of total spending on benefits , but the public 's " misperception " is that it is about 34 times higher than that . <p> Dame Anne Begg , the committee 's Labour chairman , said : " Statistics relating to benefit fraud are often conflated in media reporting with those relating to error ; and people 's perceptions of the level of benefit fraud are completely out of kilter with the official estimate .

@@2497234 <p> It began with a steady flow of coffins through the arrivals hall at Kathmandu airport . In departures , hundreds of thousands of young men were leaving their lives in Nepal to provide for their families as the human capital fuelling a multibillion-dollar construction boom in the neighbouring Gulf states . In arrivals , on a daily basis , some of their predecessors were being unloaded from the cargo hold in coffins . <p> This telltale sign that something was going very badly wrong for migrant workers led Guardian reporters on a months-long investigation that produced some chastening revelations for Qatar : workers , having paid fees to often unscrupulous middlemen , were facing horrendous conditions upon arrival in the emirate to work . Wages were often lower than billed , living quarters were often inhuman , working conditions were demanding at best , and outrageous , dangerous -- and even fatal -- at worst . <p> Many of the problems led back to the kafala system that ties migrant workers to their employers . Unable to leave the country without the permission of their sponsor , workers were often forced to accept lower wages and unsanitary , cramped and dangerous living conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case has been painstakingly documented by human rights organisations and the media . <p> Those more unlucky still ended up seriously injured and trapped in limbo in Qatar 's hospitals , abandoned by their employers , with passports and exit visas withheld , and with no insurance to pay for treatment . For others , their journey ended in a coffin being received by their shattered families in the arrivals hall . <p> Those from Nepal make up only one sixth of the migrant workers in Qatar alone . The numbers are mind-boggling : there are 1.4 million migrant workers in Qatar , making up around 94% of the overall population . The remaining 6% enjoy the highest GDP per capita of any country in the world . Yet it is the individual stories of human suffering that have brought the issue home and led a series of inspectors , from the International Labour Organisation to the United Nations , to demand change . <p> While respected human rights groups and trade unions had loudly raised the issue since Qatar was controversially awarded the World Cup in December 2010 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its investigation in September 2013 . <p> Central to the investigation was the revelation that hundreds of migrant workers are dying in Qatar each year . The Guardian produced documentation detailing the deaths of Nepalese workers . The Qatari response was at turns conciliatory and defiant . A global outcry ensued . <p> Since then , human rights groups have urged the Qatari government to make a simple , clear statement of intent by abolishing the controversial exit visa system that gives employers ultimate power over their workers and prevents workers from leaving the country without consent . <p> Yet even more liberal forces within Qatar urge caution , fearing a backlash if conservative countrymen believe they are being bounced into action by the west . Frustration has grown as existing laws have not been implemented and discussion of new ones has been caught up in red tape . <p> Those governments sending hundreds of thousands of workers to Qatar , and even the NGOs in Nepal and elsewhere campaigning for change , are also conflicted -- given the employment opportunities on offer for their people . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multinational construction firms that are profiting from Qatar 's construction boom . <p> Earlier this week , the French medal of honour was conferred on a senior Qatari official , Abdullah bin Hamad Al Attiyah , by the president , Fran ? ois Hollande . Qatar has spent ? 15bn with French companies in the past five years alone . <p> The French former president Nicolas Sarkozy urged the Uefa president , Michel Platini , to vote for Qatar to host the World Cup , which he duly did . Platini 's son is employed by a sportswear firm owned by a Qatar investment fund , although the Frenchman insists his decision to give the country his vote was his alone . <p> In Germany , Siemens has the $8.2bn contract to build the ambitious new metro system and many other firms have benefited .

And yet the focus has been very much on trade links rather than human rights . <p> On a wall in the towering office block where the Qatar 2022 supreme committee is based , an entire wall is given over to a series of drawings and plans representing the overall " masterplan " , from investment in transport infrastructure to the stadiums that must be constructed from scratch . <p> Drive through the often gridlocked traffic 10 miles out of Doha , past the virgin desert where the as-yet-unbuilt Lusail Iconic stadium is set to host the World Cup final in 2022 , and you can see a scale model of an entire city that does n't exist yet . <p> An artist 's impression of the proposed Lusail stadium in Doha , which is intended to be the centrepiece of Qatar 's World Cup in 2022 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of the other infrastructure projects on which Qatar will spend ? 123bn over the next four years alone , is not happening solely because of the World Cup but is intrinsically related to it . <p> The bold and controversial World Cup bid is an integral part of the wider 2030 Vision , a project designed to position Qatar for the future and the day when the natural oil and gas reserves that are the source of its mind-boggling wealth might run dry . <p> For its part , Fifa has twisted in the wind . World football 's governing body , discredited by a string of corruption claims , first promised in 2011 to use the spotlight afforded by the World Cup to hold Qatar to promises of reform on the way migrant workers are treated . <p> Following disturbing reports from human rights organisations such as Amnesty and Human Rights Watch , as well as the strident campaigning of the International Trade Union Confederation ( ITUC ) , Fifa 's secretary general , J ? r ? me Valcke , promised to hold Qatar to account . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular sport we have a responsibility that goes beyond the development of football and the organisation of our competitions , " he said then . <p> But little was done and the Fifa president , Sepp Blatter , was only forced to confront the issue again after the outcry that followed the Guardian 's reports . In typical fashion , Blatter has told each audience what they want to hear -- he has travelled to the Gulf to reassure and offer warm words , while employing the Fifa executive committee member Theo Zwanziger to talk tough and engage with the ITUC . <p> Fifa has insisted in statement after statement that the situation for migrant workers on the ground must improve . In a recent letter to the shadow international development secretary , Jim Murphy , Valcke again promised it was " committed to assuming its role and responsibility ... so that the situation of migrant workers in Qatar and their labour rights is addressed with the necessary urgency considering the seriousness of the matter " . <p> But in his most recent comments Blatter appeared to wash his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we know that , but this is not a question for Fifa , " he said in Hong Kong last week . " It is one which the state of Qatar must handle , as well as all the construction companies who are responsible for the workers . " <p> Even now , too little is known about the fate of many of those who travel to Qatar and other Gulf states , already tied to their sponsoring employer by kafala , in debt to middlemen and unaware of the dire conditions in which they may be forced to work . <p> Thanks to investigative work by the media and human rights organisations , and disclosures from the Pravasi Nepali Coordination Committee ( an NGO in Nepal ) and the Indian embassy , we know now that more than 500 Indian migrant workers have died since January 2012 and more than 380 Nepalese workers died in 2012 and 2013 . <p> There are an estimated 1.4 million migrant workers in Qatar . Those from India make up 22% of the total , with a similar proportion from Pakistan . About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Philippines , 8% from Egypt and 8% from Sri Lanka . <p> Not only do we not know how many migrant workers have died from those other countries , too little is known about how those from Nepal and India were killed . Latest figures obtained by the Guardian show that another 53 Nepalese people have died in Qatar this year , despite the call for action . <p> A report from Nepal 's Foreign Employment Promotion Board shows the countries where Nepalese people working abroad have died between January and April 2014 , including 53 in Qatar . Photograph : theguardian.com <p> Detailed cause-of-death information seen by the Guardian shows that many of the Nepalese workers were killed by sudden heart attacks or in road accidents , as well as workplace accidents . Yet campaigners are convinced that many of those deaths recorded as sudden heart failure are caused by overwork , and some of those road accidents are a result of a failure of health and safety practices . <p> The impediments to change are both practical and philosophical . Human rights organisations who visit Doha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures in the Qatari administration are engaging with the issue . A DLA Piper report that looked like being an attempt to knock down the claims from the media and human rights groups seems to have become a serious attempt to grapple with the issue . <p> And whereas the previous response was to attack the messenger -- the attorney general rounded on the Guardian after those initial reports -- there now appears a genuine will to at least consider the problem . The World Cup supreme committee has led the way , introducing a new code of practice for the small number of workers employed directly on building the World Cup stadiums and pointed to increased inspections . <p> There have also been longstanding promises to reform the law regarding domestic workers , who are not covered by the existing legislation and can be subject to horrific exploitation and mistreatment , and there are some signs of progress . The publication of the DLA Piper report is expected to be accompanied by what have been described as " significant " changes to labour law . There is talk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all of those commissioned by the Qatar Foundation , which oversees billions of dollars of investment every year . <p> The report this month from the UN that called for an end to kafala also expressed hope that the World Cup , and the global attention to the issue it has brought , could be a catalyst for change . <p> But those campaigning for change on the ground are conflicted . Twelve months ago , they would have been pleased at this level of engagement at senior levels in Qatar . But given the global outcry that followed the initial reports , there will be bitter disappointment if they fail to secure meaningful reform . Meanwhile the position of the emir of Qatar , Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani , and those around him in his " star chamber " remains opaque . <p> The fear is that any proposed changes , watered down so as not to offend the more conservative forces in the country , will not prove sufficient to help those most in danger . Even then , there remains concern about how strictly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unprecedented " nation building " programme given the fixed deadline of the 2022 World Cup . <p> Without fundamental reform of kafala , harsher penalties for those who transgress , the scrapping of the exit visa system , new rules to regulate recruitment agencies , much improved enforcement and a change in the culture of the companies employed to build a country 's infrastructure from scratch in record time , the situation is unlikely to improve any time soon . <p> Recent harrowing reports from the German national newspaper Die Welt and others show that the suffering continues on the ground . Meanwhile , the repatriation of bodies continues , with more than 60 workers from India and Nepal alone killed in Qatar in February and March this year .

However the Court of Appeal did not go so far as to say that a term for repayment of rent for a period after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> He added that as the Court of Appeal had refused leave to appeal its judgment , it was " questionable " whether M&amp;S would be able to appeal the case by asking the Supreme Court directly . <p> A break clause is a term in a tenancy agreement that enables a tenant to leave before the tenancy period comes to an end , provided that certain specified conditions are complied with . In this case , M&amp;S took advantage of a conditional break clause to bring its lease of four floors of an office building in Paddington to an end on 24 January 2012 , rather than continuing its tenancy until February 2018 .

" <p> This was not , however , sufficient grounds on which to infer a new term allowing M&amp;S to recover rent , service charges , car parking and insurance relating to the period after the break into the lease , she said . <p> " The first factor to bear in mind is that it would have been obvious to the parties before they signed up to the lease that there was a possibility that rent would have to be paid on the last quarter day in full for a period which went beyond the break date , " she said .

Furthermore , they must have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation of the break clause because other clauses in the lease deal with two consequences of termination . " <p> " In my judgment , when all the circumstances are considered , the correct inference to draw is that the parties proceeded on the basis that the loss from a payment of rent for the broken period should lie where it fell . Thus no term for repayment is implied , " she said . <p> Property law expert Stuart McCann said that future tenants should " ensure that they do not rely on implications elsewhere in the lease and draft to ensure that a break clause expressly provides for a repayment of rent from the break date to the next quarter day , if this is intended " .

It was clear from his trial that he had travelled to Syria to attend a terrorist training camp -- and that he intended to pursue , as prosecutors put it , a " political , religious or ideological cause " with violent means . I will set out below some more background on Kingston Crown Court 's ruling , a move that will hopefully dispel all myths about the legality of fighting in Syria . <p> In discussions about jihadists , many say " it is not illegal to fight in Syria " , justifying this assertion by comparing it to the Britons who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . George Monbiot did just this in a Guardian article this year . But this is an unhelpful observation -- the legality of British citizens fighting in the Syrian conflict is far more complex . <p> In Autumn 2013 , I served as an independent expert witness during the trial of one of the three British men accused of kidnapping and assaulting the British photojournalist John Cantlie and his Dutch colleague in Syria in 2012 . The two victims gave harrowing accounts of their traumatic and brutal ordeal . My written submission to the court discussed the many subtleties of jihadism , looking in particular at the situation in Syria . <p> When invited to make a submission by James Wood QC of Doughty St Chambers , I asked him this question of legality . He answered that it was no longer necessarily true that it is legal for a civilian to fight abroad , referring to the Terrorism Act 2006 , which stipulates that acts that would be terrorist if committed in the UK are now criminal if committed abroad under UK law . <p> These acts include membership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " , learning to handle chemical or biological weapons , and even " weapons training " . Under its predecessor , the Terrorism Act 2000 , the latter is regarded as a terrorist act -- unless the defendant can prove that it was not for terrorist purposes . <p> We can see from other recent cases , such as the response to Mohammed Gul 's appeal against his prosecution for posting videos on YouTube showing attacks on coalition forces in Iraq and Afghanistan , that " any or all military attacks by a non-state armed group against any state ... in the context of a non-international armed conflict " will be classed as an act of terrorism by the UK courts . This adds to the already broad definition of terrorism and was critiqued by David Anderson QC , the current independent reviewer of counter-terrorism legislation , but nonetheless stands in a court of law . <p> As such , any Briton learning to use a gun in Syria , never mind receiving more advanced militant training , especially if this is done at camps run by al-Qaeda-linked groups such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosecution for terrorism . <p> Recently , Quilliam discussed this further with Dominic Grieve MP , the Attorney General . His view was that that the provisions of the Terrorism Act 2006 are very general , covering a wide range of activities . However , the authorities would only prosecute if it was in the public interest to do so . For example , let 's imagine a Briton is visiting family in Syria and the neighbourhood comes under attack by regime forces , or indeed rebel ones . If said Briton were to subsequently use weapons to help defend family members or other innocent people , he would not necessarily be prosecuted in the UK . However , those who join terrorism-linked groups and proactively engage in militant activity are far likelier to be prosecuted . <p> Despite all this , in the UK the Government 's tone does appear to have softened of late . After hardline rhetoric over the past year about locking up foreign fighters for life and introducing new legislation to make such life sentences easier to prescribe , a new police-led approach seeks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muslims from fighting in Syria . I certainly welcome the move to prevent British would-be jihadists from travelling , as opposed to invariably prosecuting them when they return , but the legal precedent has already been set . <p> There is no question that British jihadists continue to further destabilise the Syrian Civil War . Moreover , in the last year , we have seen Britons becoming suicide bombers in Syria , allegedly perpetrating war crimes and , according to intelligence reports , posing an active threat to UK national security . It comes as no surprise that these acts would all be prosecuted under our current counter-terrorism legislation , but it is not so well-known that the legal threshold for terrorism charges is much lower . We would do well not to propagate the myth that these men are freedom fighters or that they should be compared to Britons who fought in the Spanish Civil War ; both legally and politically , times have changed considerably since 1939 . <p> Dr Usama Hasan is Senior Researcher in Islamic Studies at the Quilliam Foundation .

@@2516230 <h> Interview : Amat Escalante and the brutality of ' Heli ' <p> Director Amat Escalante 's third feature , Heli ( 2013 ) , has been the subject of much discussion since it received its world premiere at last year 's Cannes Film Festival . Featuring more than one scene of brutal violence , it 's been described variously as a portrait of modern Mexico , a tender love story and a blatant attempt to shock squeamish audiences . Particularly unsettling is the way in which violence seems so unexceptional to the characters , many of whom are young children . With the film arriving on DVD and Blu-ray this week courtesy of Network Releasing , just over a year after its bow on the Cannes Croisette , CineVue 's Ben Nicholson had the opportunity to sit down with the Mexican director and exchange thoughts on how his film has been received to date and also how Heli came to fruition.Ben Nicholson : Where did the idea for Heli come from ? <p> Amat Escalante : The name came before anything . I was reading an article in the newspaper about this young boy and the gang using him . He was maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the motorcycle of some guy called ' The Gorilla ' and they nicknamed the boy ' Heli ' for some reason . He would shoot people from the back of the motorcycle - he was a hired killer , you know . The name I liked and it was somewhat of an inspiration and then later came the first initial image of a young man looking for his father in the countryside . I wanted to see what happens when a family who are solid and love each other is disintegrated and tries to come back together again . <p> BN : Was Heli always intended as a personal story rather than the state of the nation address that it 's now being described as since Cannes ? <p> AE : That 's how it started . I have a theory that the more inwards you look , the more you see of the big picture . You show something between people , and they somehow represent the whole context because their problems are not just their problems , they are the problems of society . I was trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love and family and what happens when injustice occurs and people are abandoned by society - young people , children - and all these things . At the end , the consequences are very individual and are seen in a young boy or girl . <p> BN : That sense of abandonment seems to colour the way you present violence both in this and Los Bastardos . Is that something that you consciously cultivated ? AE : It might come from the way that violence is consumed and sold in Mexico . I have n't seen anywhere else where the covers of magazines show such gruesome images . There 's this morbid curiosity towards those images that has an effect on the way that people react to violence in my movies . I guess it has more to do with Mexicans ; maybe that 's why that American kid was screaming - I had n't thought of that but it makes sense now that you 've said it . <p> BN : The violence in this film has of course dominated discussion of Heli since Cannes . How have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown in Cannes it was on the first day and the press were the first to see it . I was surprised . A movie is one thing , but once hundreds of people see it then it becomes something else . It was a shock for me that it became something else so quickly . I was pleasantly surprised later when it showed in Mexico . It was a success there for us , and many people went to see it and critics really saw through the violence more . It 's a movie in Mexico that they understand as more than violence - so there at least they could see past it . Maybe it was because they had heard from the international press that it was very violent , and were expecting something even more violent ? But in Mexico it was well understood and people liked it much more that first initial press reaction at Cannes . <p> BN : The reputation certainly preceded it and with all the hype people may well have been anticipating something even more viscerally shocking than it actually was . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those scenes are n't overly dramatic , you just see the facts of what 's happening and who 's doing it . Not only kids are doing that in real life , of course , but kids are doing it , and that 's what is more alarming for me , which is why I put it in there . I 'm more worried about the young kids that do it so I put that in my movie instead of the typical one that you always see - the fat guy with a moustache , and hat , and everything . I wanted to explore that part that is not so obviously cinematic and those scenes are shot in a less cinematically , in a way . <p> BN : It 's very realistic and understated - was that always the intention ? <p> AE : I did n't think of it exactly like that , but when you make a movie there 's a world you have to inhabit that has it 's own rules otherwise things do n't fit . With those scenes , looking at them now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal suspense or a normal horror where you know what to grab onto . Here , you have nothing - you just see the act . It 's not a genre , it 's not a horror movie , but it 's like you 're looking at a horror movie . It 's very unsettling for people ; you 're confronted with this and that 's partly why people reacted the way they did , I think . It 's not shown in the way that they expect it . <p> BN : Is the use of non-professional actors part of a similar aspiration to give audiences something less obvious ? <p> AE : It 's not the only reason but it 's one of them , I think . People are used to a certain type of acting in Mexico , they are used to seeing soap operas . It 's really amazing how bad the acting is , but people never complain that it 's bad . Then people sometimes go to my movies and say that the acting is unbelievable because they are so used to seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In that way , it 's difficult to use people that are not actors , but for me there 's an excitement ; it 's very unpredictable and they will do things that are accidental but interesting . There are more non-actors in the world than actors , you know ? So I use more of those and I find the people that look right in front of the camera . Some people would never go into acting just because of how they look . Somebody 's told them they ca n't act , or they look strange ; those are the people I like . <p> BN : Just to close , you briefly mentioned horror a moments ago and seems like a genre that would suit the atmosphere and tension you are capable of creating . Have you thought of shooting a straight-up genre piece ? <p> AE : I have an idea . I do n't think I 'll do it next , though , because it 's too much work . Horror is very difficult - just those few scenes I 've had which are like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't imagine a whole movie full of those . When I have more time and budget , I have some ideas for some horror movies . Usually it would be horror set in reality - serial killers or The Texas Chain Saw Massacre - I like that kind of stuff . I actually got a script for a horror movie , but I did n't really like that . If someone sends me a good one , I 'll see.Amat Escalante 's Heli is available now on DVD and Blu-ray .

When they move to the cities , they begin to eat pre-packaged ready-to-eat meals with a variety of paper and plastic wrapping . <p> Thus waste sustainability is fast becoming an issue , threatening to overrun landfills and create new ones from what are otherwise beautiful landscapes and endangering the water supply by contamination .

@@2516236 <h> Can HR add value to its data and analytics ? <p> When it comes to HR , is data and analytics just another passing fad ? Although scepticism abounds around measurement , its ability to create useful insight should not be underestimated . <p> In 2008 , Google took another step towards omniscience . The company claimed it could forecast outbreaks of flu , weeks before the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , by intelligently using search data . For a while , it succeeded . Google had authored yet another big data success story . But , earlier this year , researchers from Northeastern and Harvard universities uncovered a rather large problem with Google Flu Trends : it was no longer accurately predicting flu cases -- overestimating the number of cases in the US for 100 of the previous 108 weeks , by up to twice as many . <p> And the reason for this inaccurate reporting ? Google 's own search algorithm and its auto-suggest feature . Type ' Do I have f ' into Google and it suggests ' Do I have flu ' , which may have led to people searching for flu when in fact they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even fibromyalgia ( a chronic condition that causes pain all over the body ) . <p> Google 's focus on correlation rather than causation ( scientists are clear that " correlation does not imply causation " ) led to what the researchers termed an embarrassing case of " big data hubris " . In other words , it forgot some of the core principles of statistics and mixed big and small data in a way that proved problematic . <p> Can business and , in particular , HR learn anything from the parable of Google Flu Trends ? Of course , most HR departments are nowhere near as sophisticated in their use of data , but there 's no ignoring the steady march of HR analytics . The question is : is anyone actually getting it right ? Or is the profession in its own small way following Google 's precarious path , seduced by the possibilities of oh-so-sexy big data and attempting to measure too much , collecting data on meaningless things or starting its explorations from the wrong place ? <p> Time to talk about analytics <p> According @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Deloitte , it 's time to reconsider HR 's relationship with data . " I 've spent the past few months at conferences taking the temperature of HR around analytics , " he says . " It 's been hot for the past couple of years , but I 'm not seeing any significant progress in the profession as a whole in terms of actually being able to do anything about it . " <p> Many HR directors would agree with this . " The measurement of the impact on people is the Holy Grail of HR , " believes Jeremy Campbell , HR director at HR and payroll specialist Ceridian . " I 've read a lot of books and articles about the methodology . What I 've not been able to find is the practical application . There 's a lot of hype . We get slightly seduced by the potential of what the data could tell you as opposed to the reality . " <p> " This is a really complex area and the minute you start talking about big data and HR analytics , everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around what you actually mean , " adds Jez Langhorn , SVP and chief people officer at McDonald 's . <p> Given HR 's fondness for fads , it 's easy to be cynical about breathless HR analytics chatter , often coming from the technology vendors with the most to gain . " Data is the new commercial , " sighs Neil Morrison , group HR director at Penguin Random House . " When HR had to be commercial , it was all about understanding this , that and the other . Now , it 's all about understanding data . But it 's not just data that 's going to help you . The gap for me is around intelligent use of data . " <p> Why data matters <p> It 's a confusing subject , and a sensitive one too . Why does it actually matter ? " There 's a massive risk for HR if it does n't engage with data , " says Edward Houghton , research adviser for human capital metrics at the CIPD , who is leading the Valuing Your Talent initiative ( see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live in an environment of data everywhere . Running a business without understanding data is not how the 21st century works . " <p> Collins makes a similar point : " There is a culture of analytic rigour being applied to everything , from smart devices in your washing machine to the way we work . Structured and unstructured data is there for us to use . HR either embraces that or decides it wants to be replaced by finance . If HR does n't seize this opportunity to become more credible around measurement and the insight that comes from that , we will be replaced by functions that will . " <p> For Campbell , the purpose of his search for data that proves HR 's impact is to help him come up with " a clear articulation of the business case " . He says : " HR professionals do a fantastic job of helping people reach their potential , but I 'm not sure how good a job we do of articulating the business impact of that . " <p> " If you really value people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's about having a conversation . Sometimes metrics will allow you to have those conversations with those leaders . If you do n't have the measures behind you , you ca n't have that argument . " <p> At PwC , for example , HR has worked with finance to " create advocates in the finance teams for HR reporting , " says Chris Weeks , strategic workforce planning leader . " If finance colleagues see the step change in the HR reporting , then they point people to HR for HR data , rather than provide it themselves . " <p> Paul Kearns , co-founder of the Institute for HR Maturity , who also chairs the British Standards Institution 's committee on professional HR standards , says his interest in metrics was formed when he worked as an in-house HRD at a manufacturing company . " What really bothered me as an executive HR guy was that I could n't convince my exec colleagues that HR was important , " he recalls . " To convince them , I first needed to convince myself by measuring what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards integrated reporting ( IR ) , which HR magazine has covered in-depth and increasingly looks like being a matter of not if , but when , and the ongoing discussion over HR professional standards . IR requires reporting around people-related measures , particularly human , intellectual , social and relationship capital . It makes sense for HR to play a leading role in reporting on these -- whether or not it will be able to do so is another matter . <p> Meaningless measures <p> Getting all this right is easier said than done . Kearns puts it bluntly : " Most HR people are not measuring anything meaningful . There 's this big game being played where HR measures its activity and tries to use that data to justify its existence . The problem is , it 's not impressing anyone . " <p> We all know the adages ' You ca n't manage what you do n't measure ' and ' What gets measured gets done ' . Maybe it 's worth coming up with a new one : pointless measurement leads to pointless data . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure everything that moves and hope they hit the target , " believes Kearns . " People are running around like headless chickens and not producing anything of real value . " <p> Morrison expresses a similar sentiment . " There 's something in using quantitative information to gain insights , but everyone rushes out to do everything and produces a huge amount of information that is n't very useful , " he says . " We stopped doing a lot of data reporting because it was meaningless . We were creating reports that no one read . " <p> Weeks agrees : " The temptation can be to develop a swathe of reports based on information that is easily accessible , but this sort of information can be of limited value and the volume of it can overwhelm and turn off business users . " <p> Campbell adds that he feels a lot of the numbers flying around are " HR for HR 's purpose as opposed to business purpose " . He says : " It is useful to run HR more efficiently by getting a headcount report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just making an HR team more efficient . That 's all well and good , but the real nugget that drives me forward is trying to figure out how to measure the impact of people on the business metrics . HR is about supporting the organisation to be better , and the purpose of the organisation is inevitably to hit business metrics . " <p> The simple fact is true value-add measures are harder to arrive at , which makes taking the easy route all too tempting . " It 's like that old joke about the drunk man only searching for his keys under the streetlight because the light is better there , " says Thomas Davenport , distinguished professor in management and information technology at Babson College and author of Big Data at Work . " People measure what is easy to measure . " <p> So , in HR terms , that means looking at cost per hire , hours spent on a training course or turnover and absenteeism . They all have their uses , but that does n't mean they offer much value . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Collins . " You have the data , so you report on it . But if you stopped producing those metrics , what would the result be ? Why measure cost per hire ? What about cost per effective hire ? Would you pay 5% more for someone who was going to be a good performer and stay longer , or would you rather take a chance on someone who might stay for three months ? " <p> David Bowes , chief people officer at managed services provider WDS , is trying to use data to come up with " a more balanced view of how effective a recruitment function can be " , looking beyond time and cost to quality of hire . " I look at how successful people are in the business and in the role they were hired for , " he explains . " That 's a measure I want the recruitment people to take on board . If we are hiring people poorly , if people are n't staying or they are not successful , that is a recruitment issue . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more sustainable model . " <p> Does HR have the skills ? <p> Tellingly , Bowes adds that he has had to change his HR team in his determination to make more intelligent use of HR data . And at every conference I 've attended on HR analytics this year ( and there have been a lot ) , most of the speakers have moved from other , more data-driven functions into HR in order to help HR harness the power of analytics . Many speakers have also alluded to the ' pushback ' and reluctance they have had to deal with from existing HR professionals . <p> According to Deloitte 's 2014 Human Capital Trends survey , 86% of companies reported no analytics capabilities in HR and 67% rated themselves ' weak ' at using HR data to predict workforce performance and improvement . " Very few people went into HR to work with numbers , " says Davenport , but he adds this is " not unique to HR ; it 's true of marketing too " -- and the marketing department is often held up as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are two main issues HR needs to tackle . One is " endemic " in the profession , the belief that people are not a number . " We have senior HR professionals who have been schooled in the world of talking about intangibles , the value of people and the value in individual capabilities without looking at it through a commercial lens , " he says . " The second is we have n't attracted the more numerate and statistically minded graduates and young professionals . " <p> But should HR become net importers of these skills from outside the profession ? It could be an unsustainable approach . " You ca n't remove the function of HR from the algorithm completely , " acknowledges Collins . " To operate analytics without that level of understanding and context creates a risk . That said , there needs to be an injection of analytic capability , and maybe that means bringing people in with those skills and developing their understanding of HR over time . " <p> Of course , tarring all HR professionals with the ' bad at numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of numbers is all they need is false . " There are HR people who are really good at numbers , and there are those who are n't , " says Stevan Rolls , UK head of HR at Deloitte , who adds that his background in occupational psychology gives him a great statistical grounding : " It 's good to have that as statistical people always assume HR wo n't know what they 're talking about . " <p> And whether or not an HR person is good at numbers , Rolls points out " the kind of value you get from analytics requires specialist help " , adding : " Analytics can be really helpful , but the stats behind it are often so complex , you have to be a statistician to work it . From an HR point of view , it 's having the people around who know enough to question the data . " <p> Morrison points out that data is " only as good as the person who uses it " . " And that 's why we 've got to be careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this , we need some really different skillsets , not just to be more commercially aware . Marketing has consumer insight teams doing this work properly . " <p> Big insight , not big data <p> The real value comes not just from data , but from insight , and knowing enough not to fall into traps like Google Flu Trend 's misstep . " If you rely overly on qualitative or quantitative insight , you wo n't get to the best of either , " says Rolls . " Some things you only get to by speaking to people : it 's hidden away in the relationships . " But he concedes that being able to achieve meaningful insight is " a scarce skillset " . " It 's trying to get HR out of producing MI and more about delivering insights . Too often HR is asked to manipulate spreadsheets . You need commercial and numerate people , but you do n't go into HR to be a spreadsheet jockey . The focus needs to be on the understanding . " <p> McDonald 's Langhorn , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " People talk about big data , but for me it 's about big insights that come from data , and putting the information in the hands of the right people at the right time . You often get report after report , when what I want is a report that tells me what I need to know and the areas to look at further . " <p> Kearns believes the concept of big data has actually made HR measurement worse as people are overcomplicating things , and Collins agrees the " analytics game for HR is about trying to get much more from less " . It 's insight that matters , and that insight comes from much more than filling in a spreadsheet or implementing the latest piece of technology . It comes from understanding narrative , context and matching qualitative and quantitative information from multiple data sets . It comes from understanding the meaning of correlation versus causation , and really knowing the culture and history of an organisation . After all , as Langhorn puts it : " There is a head and a heart element @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And one can not work without the other . 
@@2516238 <p> I started blogging way back in 2001 . At the time , blogging was just starting out and it was something I was just trying . It had no particular direction , it was just things I found on the internet . But then we moved to a house with a garden and decided to try and reduce our food miles by growing some plants on the patio . It just spiralled from there . We had more and more plants and I wrote about it , and the blog became more popular . There are lots of gardeners in my family , so I suppose it 's in my roots . But gardening was n't something I 'd always done , simply because I had nowhere to garden . It was just when we moved into our first house with a garden that it just kind of took off . <p> What have you learned about gardening and about blogging ? <p> If there 's one thing that gardening teaches you it 's patience . Plants grow at their own speed , and there 's always next year if it does n't work out . And in our really fast world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there and watch plants doing their own thing , at their own speed . <p> My gardening has been self-taught . I 've never done any courses or had any formal training . I 've read lots of books , especially when I was just starting out by gardening in containers .

I had a book called The Edible Container Garden by Michael Guerra . It 's a lovely book about growing your own food in small containers , and he 's a permaculturist as it turns out . After reading the book I went on to learn more about it . <p> Would you say you 're a permaculturist ? <p> No , not really .

And that kind of thing connects with permaculture , as that 's about the kind of plants you can plant in your garden that involve less input but produce more output . What has been popular over the past year are what we call the Lost Crops of the Incas -- plants that are originally from the Andes .

They 're my favourite plant . I also have some tiger nuts . They 're an unusual plant . I tried growing them before but these are new ones sent from a friend in Canada . I also have some Chilean guava sitting on the windowsills . I also grow the normal things like potatoes , onion , and garlic . <p> What is your inspiration to keep gardening and writing ? <p> My inspiration for the garden is certainly the plants -- I 've turned into a complete plant nerd .

They are , however , likely to be useful in specialist paediatric clinics and research . <p> Key points <p> Pain centred on the umbilicus is less likely to have an organic cause <p> Thorough examination and reassurance is usually sufficient for most patients <p> Faecal calprotectin testing should be carried out where inflammatory bowel disease is suspected , particularly if there is a family history <h> Investigations <p> The first step in dealing with RAP is to rule out the presence of an underlying organic problem.2GPs now have access to a greater number of investigations than the researchers did 50 years ago . <p> This allows a more complete assessment of the problem , but unfortunately , may identify minor , insignificant problems , which can result in unnecessary anxiety and treatment for the child . <p> Organic disease is thought to account for 5-10% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , particularly those carried out on children referred to secondary care , have found organic pathology much more common.2 <p> This should be expected , because only children with a high suspicion of pathology are usually referred . <p> The mainstay of management in RAP is reassurance.3 Many parents and children will be reassured by a thorough examination and explanation . Normal initial investigations will reassure most other families . However , some may insist on further investigations , even though the clinician may be convinced all is well . <p> At this point , an ultrasound scan is not unreasonable if it would further reassure all parties . Others may decide on a paediatric referral instead , again for added reassurance . <h> Management <p> Once consensus on diagnosis has been achieved , therapy can be considered . Therapeutic options may be classified as pharmacological , psychosocial and dietary . <p> Simple analgesics may be used during flare-ups . Prophylactic analgesia in non-migrainous RAP should be avoided , because the condition fluctuates and natural pain-free days should not be attributed to the analgesic drugs . <p> The serotonin antagonist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of abdominal migraine , while H2 receptor antagonists may have a role in RAP with dyspepsia . <p> Peppermint oil may be considered where IBS is suspected . Psychological interventions , such as CBT and family therapy , have been tried with some success in RAP . However , access to such interventions is generally limited , making it difficult for them to be routinely used . <p> Success with a single dietary component is unlikely and management should involve asking the child to keep a food and pain diary . <p> Suggestions for the addition or avoidance of certain foods can then be based on the information derived from these charts . <p> Lactose avoidance , increase in fibre intake and probiotics may also be recommended , although the evidence for their effectiveness is currently limited . <p> If you see a comment you find offensive , you can flag it as inappropriate .

It also greatly extends the scope of the legislation from equities to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landmark was reached when the MiFID II draft text was passed by the European Parliament on 15 April , MiFID II contains more than 100 requirements for ESMA to draft Regulatory Technical Standards and Implementing Technical Standards , as well as to provide technical advice to the European Commission to allow it to adopt delegated acts . In other words , while the document was passed in principle , much of the technical work remains to be done . <p> " Much of MiFID 's impact is highly dependent on the Level 2 measures that are being consulted upon , " said John Liver , head of regulatory reform for financial services EMEIA at Ernst &amp; Young . " Today 's consultation paper clearly highlights the numerous challenges of making MiFID II operational . " <p> As part of the consultation , ESMA has published two documents . The first is a consultation paper on MiFID and MiFIR technical advice , which ESMA needs to deliver to the European Commission by December ; and a discussion paper on MiFID/MiFIR draft RTS/ITS , which will provide the basis for a further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be issued in late 2014 or early 2015 . <p> The main proposals on financial markets , transparency and regulation cover how to achieve enhanced transparency and trading obligations , including increasing pre- and post-trade transparency for many categories of instruments such as equities , exchange-traded funds , certificates , bonds and derivatives and the standardisation and central trading of derivatives . They also deal with high frequency trading , direct electronic access and obligations for firms using trading algorithms , as well as data publication and access , including the creation of a consolidated tape of post-trade data , reporting mechanisms and access to CCPs for clearing . <p> " A key area of focus for ESMA will be the wider context of automated trading using algorithms , including HFT , " said Liver . " And much needs to be clarified by ESMA on how trading caps for dark pool equity transactions will work , not to mention how suitability tests will function on the consumer protection side . It 's really important we get this next level of detail right , and leading investment firms , trading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to actively engage in the process as a matter of priority to help shape the implementation details . " <p> There is also a focus on investor protection , especially retail investors , which covers limitations on inducements , controls for independent advice and product governance , the introduction of powers for ESMA to ban products , and improved information requirements on costs and charges that will be applied to clients . <p> ESMA will hold three public hearings about secondary markets , investor protection and commodity derivatives issues on 7-8 July . <p> " The launch of today 's MiFID II/MiFIR consultation process is an important step in the biggest overhaul of financial markets regulation in the EU for a decade , " said Steven Maikoor , ESMA chair . " The reform of MiFID is an integral part of the EU 's strategy to address the effects of the financial crisis and aims to bring greater transparency to markets and to strengthen investor protection . These changes are key to restoring trust in our financial markets .

The closing date for responses to both ESMA papers is Friday 1 August . <p> The European Commission has acknowledged that further delay to MiFID II may be ' necessary ' , following a letter from ESMA which said it would not be possible to implement the legislation in time . The delay follows an earlier setback in May and means the new rules could be delayed until January 2018 . <p> As the European Commission 's MiFID II legislation moved towards implementation of technical standards , some of Europe 's national regulators are seriously worried that mandatory open access to CCPs may not be such a good idea .

@@2526240 <p> The story goes like this . My grandfather attended school for one day in order to tell the teacher he would n't be back because he had to work . His older sister , he said , would teach him to read . It was one of those details that surface in family lore , but it was n't long before I wondered where was this " school " ? He was born in 1864 , a year after the Emancipation Proclamation . Where would a school be in mid-19th century rural Alabama ? In a church basement ? Beneath trees out in the woods ? Who was this daring , revolutionary teacher ? The location would have to be hidden because black people 's access to education in general and reading specifically was violently discouraged and , in most of the South , teaching African Americans to read had been illegal . Virginia law , in 1831 , is instructive and representative . " Any white person assembling to instruct free Negroes to read or write shall be fined not over $50 also be imprisoned not exceeding two months . It is further enacted that if any white person for pay shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read or write he shall for each offence be fined at the discretion of the justice ten to one hundred dollars . " In short , there would be no teaching , paid or unpaid , of free Negroes or slaves without penalty . Any teacher would have to be aware of the risk he or she was taking . <p> Nevertheless , my grandfather 's sister was successful because against all odds , he did become literate . The next question was how would he use that skill ? What was there for him to read ? Books on that poor little farm in Greenville , Alabama ? Unlikely . Library ? Certainly not . But there was one book available : the Bible . Which is why , I suppose , that among his legendary accomplishments was his boast that he had read the King James Version of the Bible cover to cover five times . <p> Reading and script writing were prized in my family not only for information and pleasure but also as a defiant political act since historically so much effort had been used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guild in the Forties . We subscribed to newspapers devoted exclusively to African-American news and opinions . Issues of the Pittsburgh Courier and the Cleveland Call and Post were worn to shreds with multiple readings and readers . Like other ethnic newspapers , ours elicited passionate commentary , questions , argument . We pored over JA Rogers 's work , Du Bois 's The Souls of Black Folk and whatever else we could find that encouraged and informed us about being black in America . <p> It was inevitable , therefore , that when I edited The Black Book , a complex record of African-American life that I solicited from collectors , the earliest newspapers would fascinate me , especially the " coloured " ones . There , in photographs and print so much African-American history -- sad , ironic , resistant , tragic , proud , and triumphant -- was on display . Of particular interest were those printed in the 19th century when my grandfather spent his few minutes at school . I learnt there were about 50 black newspapers produced in the southwest following emancipation and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to establish black towns was as feverish as the rush for whites to occupy the land . The " coloured " newspapers encouraged the rush and promised a kind of paradise to the newcomers : land , their own government , safety ; there were even movements to establish their own state . <h> Related Articles <p> One theme , in particular , in those papers intrigued me . Prominent in their headlines and articles was a clear admonition : " Come Prepared or Not At All " . <p> Implicit in those warnings were two commands : 1 . If you have nothing , stay away . 2 . This new land is Utopia for a few . Translation : no poor former slaves are welcome in the paradise being built here . <p> What could that mean for ex- slaves -- threatened , exhausted refugees with no resources ? How would they feel having trekked all that way from chains into freedom only to be told : " This here is Paradise but you ca n't come in . " I also noticed that the town leaders in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also a feature of the separation ? One that replicated the white racism they abhorred ? <p> I wanted to dig into these matters by exploring the reverse : exclusivity by the black-skinned ; and construction of their own " gated community " , one that refused entrance to the mixed race . Considering the need for progeny in order to last , how would patriarchy play and how might matriarchy threaten ? In order to describe and explore these questions I needed 1 ) to examine the definition of paradise , 2 ) to delve into the power of colourism , 3 ) to dramatise the conflict between patriarchy and matriarchy , and 4 ) disrupt racial discourse altogether by signalling then erasing it . <p> The idea of paradise is no longer imaginable or , rather , it is overimagined , which amounts to the same thing -- and has therefore become familiar , commercialised , even trivial . Historically , the images of paradise in poetry and prose were intended to be grand but accessible , beyond the routine but imaginatively graspable , seductive as though remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairest fruit , Blossoms and fruits at once of golden hue ... with gay enamelled colours mixed ... ; of Native perfumes .

Groves whose rich trees wept odorous gums and balm ; Others whose fruit , burnished with golden rind , Hung amiable ... of delicious taste . Betwixt them lawns , or level downs , and flocks Grazing the tender herb . " " Flowers of all hue and without thorn the rose . " " Caves of cool recess , o'er which the mantling vine Lays forth her purple grape and gently creeps Luxuriant ... " <p> That beatific , luxurious expanse we recognise in the 21st century as bounded real estate owned by the wealthy and envied by the have-nots , or as gorgeous parks visited by tourists . Milton 's Paradise is quite available these days , if not in fact then certainly as ordinary , unexceptionable desire . Modern paradise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rest and exclusivity . Eternity seems to be forsworn . <p> Plenty in a world of excess and attending greed , which tilts resources to the rich and forces others to envy , is an almost obscene feature of a contemporary paradise . In this world of outrageous , shameless wealth squatting , hulking , preening before the dispossessed , the very idea of " plenty " as Utopian ought to make us tremble . Plenty should not be understood as a paradise-only state but as normal , everyday , humane life . <p> Rest that is the respite from labour or fighting for rewards or luxury has dwindling currency these days . It is a desire-less-ness that suggests a special kind of death without dying . Rest can suggest isolation , a vacation without pleasant or soothing activity . In other words , punishment and/or wilful laziness . <p> Exclusivity , however is still an attractive , even compelling feature of paradise because so many people -- the unworthy -- are not there . Boundaries are secure , watchdogs , security systems , and gates are there to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from crowded urban areas proliferate . Thus it does not seem possible or desirable for a city to be envisioned let alone built in which poor people can be accommodated . Exclusivity is not just a realised dream for the wealthy , it is a popular yearning of the middle class . " Streets " are understood to be populated by the unworthy , the dangerous . Young people strolling are understood to be prowling the streets and up to no good . Public space is fought over as if it were private . Who gets to enjoy a park , a beach , a street corner ? The term " public " is itself a site of contention . <p> Eternity , which avoids the pain of dying again , is rendered null by secular , scientific arguments ; yet it has nevertheless the greatest appeal . Medical and scientific resources are directed toward more life and fitter life , and remind us that the desire is for earthbound eternity , rather than eternal afterlife . The implication being that this is all there is . <p> Thus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavenly one has serious intellectual and visual limitations . Aside from " Only me or us forever " , heavenly paradise hardly bears mention . <p> Toni Morrison ( Reuters ) <p> But that might be unfair . It is hard not to notice how much more attention is given to hell rather than heaven . Dante 's Inferno beats out Paradiso every time . Milton 's brilliantly rendered pre-paradise world , known as Chaos , is far more fully realised than his Paradise . The visionary language of the doomed reaches heights of linguistic ardour with which language of the blessed and saved can not compete . <p> There were reasons for the images of the horrors of hell to be virulently repulsive in the 15th and 16th centuries . The argument for avoiding hell needed to be visceral , needed to reveal how much worse such an eternity was than the hell of everyday life . That was when paradise was simply the absence of evil -- an edgeless , already recognisable landscape : great trees for shade and fruit , lawns , palaces , precious metals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and waging war against the unworthy , there seems to be nothing for the inhabitants of paradise to do . An open , borderless , come-one-come-all paradise , without dread , minus a nemesis is no paradise at all . <p> Notable in Milton 's Paradise is the absence of women . Eve alone is given the most prominent space in that place . Progeny apparently is not required since there will always be more blessed to enter . Also , besides caretaking , what is there for women to do ? <p> Since the paradise the black newspapers envisioned not so subtly encouraged light-skinned applicants , a major excitement for me in writing Paradise was an effort to disrupt the assumptions of racial discourse . I was eager to manipulate , mutate and control imagistic , metaphoric language in order to produce something that could be called race-specific/race-free prose , language that deactivated the power of racially inflected strategies -- transform them from the straitjacket a race-conscious society can , and frequently does , buckle us into -- a refusal to " know " characters or people by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristics of racist thought is that it never produces new knowledge . It seems able to merely reformulate and refigure itself in multiple but static assertions . It has no referent in the material world ; like the concept of black blood or white blood or blue blood , it is designed to construct artificial borders and maintain them against all reason and all evidence to the contrary . And while racist thought and language have an almost unmitigated force in political and social life , the realm of racial difference has been allowed an intellectual weight to which it has no claim . It is truly a realm that is no realm at all -- an all-consuming vacancy that is both common and strange . <p> Material relating to the black towns founded by African Americans in the 19th century provided a rich field for an exploration of race-specific/race-free language . I am aware of how whiteness matures and ascends the throne of universalism by maintaining its powers to describe and enforce its descriptions . To challenge that view of universalism , to exorcise , alter , and de-fang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostility seemed to me a daunting project and an artistically liberating one . <p> " They shoot the white girl first . With the rest they can take their time . " <p> With these opening sentences I wanted to signal 1 ) the presence of race as hierarchy and 2 ) its collapse as reliable information . The novel places an all-black community , one chosen by its inhabitants , next to a raceless one , also chosen by its inhabitants . The grounds for traditional black versus white hostilities shift to the nature of exclusion , the origins of chauvinism , the sources of oppression , assault , and slaughter . The black town of Ruby is all about its own race -- preserving it , developing myths of origin , and maintaining its purity . In the Convent , race is indeterminate -- all racial codes are eliminated , deliberately withheld . For some readers this was disturbing and some admitted to being preoccupied with finding out which character was the " white girl " ; others wondered initially and then abandoned the question ; some ignored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceptive ones read them as fully realised individuals -- whatever their race . Unconstrained by the weary and wearying vocabulary of racial domination , the narrative seeks to unencumber itself from the limit that racial language imposes on the imagination . The conflicts are gender-related and generational . They are struggles over history -- who will tell and thereby control the story of the past ? Who will shape the future ? There are conflicts of value , of ethics . Of personal identity . What is manhood ? Womanhood ? And , finally , what is personhood ? <p> Raising these questions seemed most compelling when augmented by yearnings for freedom and safety ; for plenitude , for rest , for beauty ; by the search for one 's own space , for respect , love , bliss -- in short , how to reimagine paradise . Not the " Come Prepared or Not At All " command to make sure you get a ticket before you enter a theme park ; but an interrogation into the narrow imagination that conceived and betrayed paradise . <p> We called him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a yam with his pocketknife .

Wherever he was -- on the porch , at the kitchen table , in the living room reading -- that 's where the power and deference were . He did n't exert power ; he assumed it . And it was in part from knowing him that I felt I could understand and create the men in Ruby -- their easy assumption of uncontested authority . Big Papa . A survivor .

This commodity approach means we can start to treat servers like cattle now , " said Chef 's Arbuckle . <p> Arbuckle also says we can now still be very precise in terms of the way we can configure the machine , so there is no danger of animal cruelty . <p> Looking forward , he says he will look to see where Chef can help address business-specific use cases and investment in the developer community across Europe .

And , musically , that 's the journey of the show , starting with music hall and working its way through to rock'n'roll . The story is a character study in change . At the time , it was a big success .

We 've ripped the show apart and put it back together again . But what we 've stayed true to is the heart of the show Joan and Lionel created . <p> When I first worked with Lionel , I was just out of college . I 'd seen a South Bank Show about him before the Cameron Mackintosh revival of Oliver ! opened at the Palladium in 1994 . I was studying politics at the time and was going to be a lawyer . It made me think : do I really want to do this ? I play the piano , I 've been doing music all my life . I 'll give myself a year . So I wrote Lionel a letter the September before I graduated . At Christmas I heard back . We went for lunch and he told me : " If you are serious about this , call me after graduation and come and work with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended up in this very modest flat above a launderette in Acton . He was n't very well . He had lost himself to drink and drugs for almost 20 years . He had sold the rights to everything . Some people thought he was dead because he had n't been seen for so long . He would sing these song ideas into a dictaphone and it was my job to write them out . He could n't read or write music . That 's not uncommon : a lot of today 's pop stars ca n't . But melody and instinct , they were just in Lionel . Writing a song should be like sneezing . The genius of Lionel Bart was that he was still writing melodies you felt you already knew , songs like Consider Yourself and Oom Pah Pah . <p> Lionel 's own story is , in some ways , a tragedy . He went from East End rags to riches to rags again . We 're talking here about someone who was at the very centre of the swinging 60s . Round at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounding him . He was bigger than they were . He had a series of hit musicals running internationally long before Andrew Lloyd Webber . He conquered the pop charts . And the parties at his house went on for weeks . They were legendary . But it led to excess and , in my view , a feeling that he could just do it again and again . By the time he made Twang ! ! , which Joan also directed until she left , it was all over the place and he was all over the place . <p> I was in his office one day , sitting at this little piano he had had all his life , where he wrote Oliver ! , struggling to finish my own first musical . He said : " Sum it up in one phrase . " It 's what Bernstein had told him , that the heart of West Side Story was there in that one musical and lyrical phrase , ' Somewhere ' . In Oliver ! it 's in Where is Love ? Everyone in Oliver ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oliver , the workhouse children , Nancy , even Bill Sykes . Everything flows back to that one idea . <p> Lionel , too , was looking for love . I 'm currently working in pre-production on a film about his life . Geoffrey Rush is going to play him and it uses Lionel 's own songs to tell his story . There 's deep sadness at the heart of it . And yet out of this life he created untold joy for millions of people , and his songs and shows are still performed all over the world . So , ultimately , it 's a story of love . <h> Jessie Wallace : ' Lil is a proper London character ' <p> I 've always loved Lionel Bart ever since I first saw Oliver !

But she has a really fun side too and she gets to wear this fabulous polka dot dress . A proper London character . The words are great : all that Jewish language and the Polari gay slang . I 've based Lil 's accent on my nan Iris , who was a proper East End cockney . <p> Elliot has added some of Lionel 's other big songs into the show including Living Doll and Sparrers Ca n't Sing , which Barbara Windsor did in the 1960 Joan Littlewood film .

And as Valve loosens its grip on curation of its eponymous Steam store , there 's a fear such ideas will be the subject of a myriad of copycats skewing innovation with accusations of game cloning . <p> Last week , indie developer and Spiderweb Software founder Jeff Vogel claimed the indie bubble on PC was popping and the so-called " easy money " of yester-year was now " off the street " . <p> " Everyone thought they could make a million dollars by churning out their first unity project with placeholder art .

The rest , probably not . " <p> If Steam turns into the App Store , I feel that 's bad for everyone . Somewhere in-between would be lovely . <p> Dan Marshall , Size Five Games <p> The assertion the party is over for some indies is n't shared by everyone though . Size Five Games founder and Gun Monkeys developer Dan Marshall says there 's no such thing as thing as an indie bubble , and believes we 've entered an era where triple-A , indie and hobbyist games are all on equal footing in terms of distribution thanks to digital download stores . <p> " This is a brilliant and exciting time ; dozens upon dozens of new gaming experiences to cater for every taste , " he says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movies being released , or do you scroll through Netflix endlessly hoping for something new to have cropped up ? " <h> The gatekeepers <p> The issue of curation is a huge problem facing Steam . Valve is no longer trying to act as the gatekeeper , playing an influential role in who succeeds and who fails on PC , but is the alternative sustainable , or even a preferred option ? <p> Marshall continues : " It 's a mixed bag . I think more games is a brilliant thing , because games are fun and exciting , and I can see that there 's only one way for Steam to go , and that 's to open up . The system before was unmanageable . <p> " That said , I 'm a firm believer in curated stores being better for both developers and gamers , and remain hopeful that either the Steam front page remains highly curated , or that someone else of influence steps up and curates as a third-party . If Steam turns into the App Store , I feel that 's bad for everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believes Steam has already passed the point where a new release on Valve 's digital store is a news event , and said it was now incumbent on indies themselves to make sure their games get in front of players ' eyes and excite them . <p> He also adds that he 's Valve 's future plans for Steam , and believes indies should not panic about the recent influx of titles . <p> " I do n't look at new releases any more . Suddenly you have to actually hear about a new game from the mainstream media or through word-of-mouth , " he says . <p> " I do n't think that 's bad at all . I met with Valve and talked about their future plans for Steam , and I know that what they are planning will be much better than the current situation , and much better than it ever has been .

Greenlight never really worked , " she says . " Chompy Chomp Chomp appeals to what equates to a niche market on Steam . Valve is moving into the living room space so they 'll benefit from expanding their appeal . It 's better to have lots of choice available and offer games that are outside what the typical Steam user would want . That 's how the industry will expand the games market and create new gamers . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a community voting platform Valve had hoped would help solve its curation crisis -- is somewhat shared by another developer , Freejam 's Mark Simmons . <p> The indie studio itself breezed through Greenlight with its new game Robocraft , which now boasts 400,000 users , but Simmons admits other developers have not been so lucky . <p> " Less curation can be a bad thing . Greenlight is community led , so having already amassed a large community in Robocraft we got green lit in record time ; but , if you 've made a game that is beautiful , but is n't a natural community builder , you 're going to have a hard time in Greenlight , " he says . <p> " In those cases a trusted curator , like Steam , could really help you get noticed . Good quality curation can minimise dilution as well , i.e. community curation often means more volume , and more volume often leads to the great being diluted with the not so great .

To ensure Robocraft gets noticed , with players actually playing the game around the clock , he says the team has had to try all available avenues open to them , including advertising , Twitch streaming , press releases , press kits and expos . <p> " It 's all worked a little , and we 've had have to do it all to get to break even , " he states . " I ca n't say enough to devs that you have to treat PR as importantly as you treat your game dev . It 's so hard for indies to think that way , as typically we just want to make great games and do n't want to get involved in all that PR nonsense . <p> " We 've been lucky , we 've had some coverage from some large YouTubers and that has generated the most installs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturing coverage . " <p> The inevitability of discounts is teaching gamers to never buy at full price , and that does worry me . <p> Cliff Harris , Positech Games <p> Marshall agrees that promoting your games and building up the hype is critical to get people playing your game . And says that just getting on Steam has never been enough . <p> " Indies have always had to survive on their own , and that 's the point , " he says . <p> " The suggestion that ' being on Steam ' was enough is kind of nonsense . It helped , especially during sales , but it certainly has never been the be-all and end-all . The best indies have made brilliant games , with high Metacritic scores , promoted them , promoted themselves , got the word out , built the hype . Indies who think the job ends with the last line of code are kidding themselves ; it 's not down to Steam to promote your game . It 's not down to Steam to get you reviews , or Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have . " <p> One way developers have tried to promote themselves is through sales , as seen daily on Steam and the pay-what-you-like game sales on Humble Bundle . <p> Harris warns however that constant sales can be bad for indies , and savvy consumers could start waiting for discounts before they consider a purchase . <p> " It 's fine to have sales of games , but people now expect a launch discount , and then a 50 per cent off within a month , and that 's just plain dumb , " he says . " We do n't expect that with anything else . The inevitability of discounts is teaching gamers to never buy at full price , and that does worry me . <p> " I actually think that developers are hugely wrong about the financial impact of sales . There is this mantra that ' all the money comes from deep sales ' but whenever I crunch the actual numbers for my games I find it is n't true . Game devs have to learn to develop more interesting hooks to draw attention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says the real trick to standing out and selling your game is to make an interesting game , and one that fills a gap in the market . After all , one of the main attractions to indie games is the developer 's willingness to experiment and innovate . <p> " There was n't another Goat Simulator or Surgeon Simulator game , and they got huge attention , " he says . " If the plan is to make another me-too platformer or rogue-like or Minecraft clone and hope it sells , then yes , you are screwed , but frankly you should be . Indies just need to learn to innovate again . " <h> What now ? <p> The notion of the indie bubble appears to be one that believes indies could rock up on Steam or any other store and sell their game without much or any marketing or promotion . Because quality speaks for itself , right ? While it may continue to herald success for a special few games , as titles flood Steam , this tactic will no longer work . <p> As Simmons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PR work themselves and build up hype for their games . <p> So has the indie bubble burst ? If its definition is to be a success without promoting your game , then yes , it has . <p> But if it means are there about to be less indies than ever with rare success stories ? Then no . Remember , more games than ever are coming to PC . But do developers now have to put in more work to get noticed ?

Besides his main research focuses , he also enjoys local history and the interesting tales it often turns up . <h> Share by email <p> As anyone who has either grown up or spent an extended amount of time in Lincoln is certainly well aware , our fair city was the birthplace of the modern tank . The recent Lincoln Inspired festival featured several interesting talks ; but perhaps none was more interesting from my point of view than that of Richard Pullen , a local historian discussing his book The Landships of Lincoln . Based on his fascinating and entertaining discussion , I thought I would spend a few column inches looking at the history of the tank and the role our city played in its development . <p> Despite earlier attempts at armoured vehicles , in reality the history of the tank began as the fighting in Europe bogged down .

Establishing the Landships committee in early 1915 , he passionately oversaw the development of the tank and argued its cause at the highest levels . These machines were to be ' landships ' in every sense of the word : they had commanders , not captains , they had hulls and they used navy guns as their primary fire-power . <p> Little Willie , an early design of the tank by William Tritton in Lincoln . <p> While several manufacturers were mooted to design a prototype @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rivals , in large part due to the previous designs of William Tritton . While attempts at a grandiose trench crosser quickly failed , soon the ingenious decision to utilize American farming tracks on an armoured car was taken , and within months No.1 Lincoln Machine was tested in early September , 1915 . After tweaking the tracks , a new model , nicknamed Little Willie was developed by the end of they year . This design was furthered refined by the first of the Big Willie tanks , nicknamed Mother , which featured a more improved rhomboid design for clearing trenches without getting stuck . <p> Soon , these tanks were brought into mass production , with the workers ( often , as Pullen pointed out , women ) famously being told that they were building ' water tanks for Mesopotamia , ' hence the name ' tank ' . It should be noted that the vast majority of tanks were not built in Lincoln by Fosters . Rather , they were often built in Birmingham , Newcastle or other large industrial centres .

By 1916 , tanks were popularly used by the War Office as travelling billboards for the selling of war bonds . Often , tanks which had been scarred by action would arrive in town centres and the public would be encouraged to give money for the war effort . Lincoln , however , was continually passed over , until a public campaign finally secured such a visit to Cornhill in early 1918 .

I remember Nancarrow being championed in the 80s by Ligeti , and now he is name-checked by young composers as a major influence . <p> Radical thinking ... pianist and curator Rolf Hind PR <p> John Cage and Julius Eastman knew each other in New York but had a spat when the latter interpreted a seemingly " free " score of Cage 's " wrongly " ( too much sex ) which perhaps merely goes to show the creative tension that exists between two urges : to control or allow everything .

He posited the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the I Ching , technology and Finnegan 's Wake , the rasas of Hindu art and the riddles of Zen . In some pieces , like the tiny piano work Seven Haiku , this teasing leads to a written riddle : the music is so detailed , the calligraphy so exquisite , yet the instructions cancel each other out . It 's Zen brought to life as score-art and sound , and continues to fascinate . <p> Sometimes , as in his pieces for prepared piano , the radical new art finds its voice for the simplest reason . Cage only had a piano at his disposal in the 1940s . He wanted an entire percussion orchestra , so he started treating it with various objects . The resulting hybrid still sounds extraordinary , opening up undreamt of areas of expression . <p> Back in the 20s were other fashionable radicals of the Machine Age : George Antheil and Henry Cowell .

Cowell was the first to thoroughly investigate the new uses of the piano , a precursor of Crumb . Antheil , the teen Bad Boy , thrilled audiences with violent machine-age outpourings . An outsider , the newly immigrant Frenchman Edgard Var ? se combined these trends in an evocative blend : his Am ? riques , a score full of percussion and noise that depicts the violent beauty of Manhattan Metropolis . <p> The Founding Father of this US radicalism is Charles Ives , a composer who hardly heard his own work . Indeed he maintained a career in life insurance and wrote his visionary music on the side . His monumental Concord Sonata combines the many literary and popular influences of his America : ragtime , popular song , hymns ; literature , both domestic and everyday ( the Alcotts ) , and wild and visionary ( Thoreau ) . Later audiences identified this urgent attempt to forge a cultural identity where one was needed , a radicalism that still thrills today . <p> The magic of Ives ' story is that he credits his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence . Ives Senior recognised back in the 1870s that most audiences exposed to more than a C-G-C pattern " had to be carried off on a stretcher " - as Ives himself put it . He explored tuning systems , foreshadowing Partch , as well as many other musical experiments , and encouraged a current of questioning , a fanatical disregard for the nice or conventional , which flowed into his son . It 's good to know , or to hope , that such radicalism is always Out There , when any citizen interrogates reality to create culture .

For many years , up until as recently as 2012 , much of his work was kept under lock &amp; key by GCHQ because they were deemed too important and sensitive for public release . <p> His OBE for wartime services , awarded to him by King George VI , also did n't disclose what his OBE was for .

The revelation of this secret , which became public after a police investigation into a separate matter , would unfairly tarnish his reputation in time of barbaric laws and ignorance . <p> A time when one 's sexuality could result in a conviction and decimate a lifetime of brilliance and accomplishments . <p> Thankfully those days are over and we can properly celebrate what Turing did for this country loudly and proudly .

In a time when the first general purpose computers had just been built , Turing was already asking the question ' can computers think ' ? <p> It was that question that resulted in the Turing Test , which dictates that a computer can only be truly intelligent , or said to ' think ' , if a human interrogator can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human being . <p> The Turing test is still considered a benchmark for charting the progression of A.I , although some question whether or not it 's still relevant because no computer is has been able to score a passing mark . <p> His brilliance was exhibited when he created a chess computer programme for a computer that was yet to exist , when he then tried to install it on an existing computer it simply failed .

When someone talks about our penchant for innovation and science , they always refer to either the Manchester Mark 1 or Automatic Computing Engine , the latter designed by Turing . <p> In 2014 , countries around the world are battling it out to be crowned the number one ' innovation economy ' , with a huge focus on technology and creativity . Computers come in all different sizes and can do things that would 've been deemed as magic in Turing 's day . <h> What could have been <p> Countries like South Korea are also genuinely looking towards robots and artificial intelligence to solve the issue of an ageing population - all thanks to one simple question ' can a computer think ?

@@2553237 <p> Not too long ago , leeches were all the rage throughout Europe . Umm , ok , in America too . But to a far lesser extent . This is due to the misplaced but long-held notion that human health depended upon maintaining balance between the four humours -- black bile , yellow bile , phlegm and blood . Of all those humours , it was blood that received the most attention . If it was decided that you either had " bad blood " or too much blood , the medical people of the day would use a leech or two to remove it . This practice was known as " blood letting " . <p> Leeches are specialised predatory or parasitic worms ( subclass Hirudinea ) that feed on other animals . A few species are terrestrial , but most are aquatic , with the vast majority of those living in fresh water . <p> True leeches ( Euhirudinea ) are charming creatures with suckers on each end of their bodies ( although they typically only feed using their anterior sucker , the posterior sucker strengthens their attachment to their host ) . Similar to segmented worms ( Annelida ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leeches are hermaphrodites , so each individual is both a Larry and a Lucia . Unfortunately for leeches , they are not their own best friend , which means they still have to actively seek out a mate so they can reproduce . <p> Leeches are subdivided into two major groups based upon the structure of their feeding apparatus . Although most leech species are carnivorous , and their feeding apparatus are designed specifically for preying upon small invertebrates , a minority of leeches are parasites that feed by sucking blood from other animals . Most of these blood-sucking species are unable to bite ; feeding either upon the blood of dead animals or already open wounds on a living animal . <p> The most famous of all blood-sucking leeches are the so-called medicinal leeches , Hirudo medicinalis . They CAN bite : Their anterior sucker is comprised of jaws made up of three parts and armed with hundreds of tiny , very sharp teeth . This jaw arrangement leaves a distinctive mark on the skin that looks like a " Y " within a circle . <p> Whilst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that keeps the blood from clotting . Hirundin is a small protein , comprised of just 65 amino acid residues , that binds to , and thereby inhibits , the activity of thrombin , which is part the blood-clotting cascade .

But medicinal leeches have also made a comeback in modern medicine , because they can be applied to specific areas of the body -- particularly to skin grafts and in some types of reconstructive surgeries -- where their bites stimulate healing by increasing the flow of nourishing blood . <p> Here 's an interesting video , courtesy of the Royal Institution , that tells us a little more about medicinal leeches :

@@2558232 <h> Bloodborne preview -- a beast of a project <p> GameCentral gets a sneak peak at the PS4 's latest exclusive , a new horror adventure from the creator of the original Dark Souls . <p> If it was n't for the leaks Bloodborne would 've been the biggest surprise of the evening , at Sony 's pre-E3 media briefing . But news of the game , under its codename of Project Beast , had emerged earlier and so although the name Bloodborne was new the basic gist of the game was not . <p> The quality of Bloodborne was n't surprising either , given creator Hidetaka Miyazaki was also the director of the first Dark Souls ( but not the second ) . This may not be the sort of game to show off your new PlayStation 4 to the in-laws , but it has every chance of becoming the console 's best exclusive so far . <p> Bloodborne is n't hands-on at E3 and was only being shown in a secretive looking cove inside Sony 's behind closed doors press room . The primary reason for this is probably the variable frame rate , which although it might seem almost nostalgic for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Sony to demonstrate their still new console . The game 's not due out until an unspecific point next year though , so there 's plenty of time to fix the technical issues . <p> The visuals themselves though are excellent , similar to Dark Souls in style but more 19th century than medieval , and with a much greater focus on gore and body horror . The atmosphere has something of an antique Silent Hill about it , despite the gameplay itself being more action-packed and bloody than Miyazaki 's previous game . <p> The city in question is called Yharham , which has been overrun by a virulent disease that turns the citizens into zombie-like creatures at best and more revolting monster at worst . In the early days of the plague the city was rumoured to have a cure , which has led to even more of the infected travelling there and dooming the few healthy people left . <p> Bloodborne -- pro tip : do n't go to Yharham for your holidays <p> Everything in the game world seems to be damp and pustulous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were themselves as sickly as their inhabitants .

Instead of swords and shields he dual wields weapons such as a primitive shotgun and a combination meat cleaver and saw . <p> As unlikely as the comparison may seem we 're reminded of Devil May Cry , not in terms of the speed and athleticism of the combat but the very specific purpose behind each weapon .

Like Dark Souls you do have the chance to engage it with a human-controlled ally in tow but how exactly you meet and interact with people in the game is being left purposefully obscure . In the demo you happen upon someone already embroiled in a fight with a monster , but whether they 're meant to have leaked into your game , or are always there , is unclear . <p> As you 'd expect from the makers of Dark Souls a great deal of the game is being kept purposefully secret at the moment , and will likely remain so even after the game is released . <p> But that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game , and although it 's not clear how difficult the game is -- since we have n't played it ourselves -- the emphasis on attack rather than defence suggests to us that Miyazaki is going more for psychological hardships than gamepad-bending ones .

When testing for the progress of HIV in a patient , doctors will take a CD4 cell count in a cubic millimetre of blood , with between 500 and 1,500 cells/mm3 being within the normal range . If it drops below around 250 , it means HIV has taken hold -- the virus ravages these cells and uses them as an entry point . <p> HIV gains entry by attaching itself to a receptor protein on the CD+4 T cell surface known as CCR5 .

The Californian team hoped to go right to the core of the problem instead , and artificially replicate the protective CCR5 mutation . <p> Kan has been working for years on a precise process for cutting and sewing back together genetic information .

@@2566236 <h> Review of books <h> God is dead , long live God <p> Terry Eagleton casts a critical eye over efforts to fill that God-shaped hole . <p> F <p> 13 June 2014 <h> Get spiked by email <p> For millennia , religion has satisfied that search for meaning that comes from being human , and in its ability to provide meaning it also gave authority to those who were in a position to control it . Religion has done the state some service . However , over the past 200-or-more years in the West , it has increasingly failed to satisfy a more rational age , and its retreat has posed a problem not only for those who wish to rule , but perhaps , more surprisingly , also for those who have ceased to believe . What other cultural form can now serve to cohere society around a convincing set of values ? What other set of insights and intuitions , what other truth and beauty , can now speak to those who are still asking ' Why ' ? <p> It is to these great questions of culture and religion that Terry Eagleton returns in his latest collection of lectures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly half a century . Surveying the decline of religious faith , and the diverse attempts to forge ' surrogate forms of transcendence , plugging the gap where God had once been ' , he observes that ' the Almighty has proved remarkably difficult to dispose of ' . <p> Though as an economic system capitalism is ' intrinsically faithless ' , relying on the dull compulsion of the market , it is a ' true believer ' in the value of traditional religion in the sphere of morality and social conduct . The problem here is not only that the advance of market forces , science , technology and education have had a corrosive effect on popular faith . It is also the case that the distinctive ideologies of capitalism -- pragmatism , materialism and utilitarianism -- lack an affirmative , affective quality that might inspire the masses . Eagleton quotes the judgement of the ( recently beatified ) Victorian Anglo-Catholic John Henry Newman , that liberalism was ' too cold a principle to prevail with the multitude ' . <p> The quest for a ' viceroy for God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likes a list , provides a long one : ' Reason , Nature , Geist , culture , art , the sublime , the nation , the state , science , humanity , Being , Society , the Other , desire , the life force and personal relations : all of these have acted from time to time as forms of displaced divinity . ' The very survival of religion confirms the difficulty of replacing the complex role it plays in the life of human societies . Eagleton pays particular attention to the attempts by Enlightenment , idealist and Romantic philosophers to produce a convincing secular alternative to orthodox Christianity , but finds them all too esoteric , too rationalistic , too implausible . ( He pays a tongue-in-cheek tribute to sport as the most successful contemporary version of religion , listing the ' sacred icons , revered traditions , symbolic solidarities , liturgical assemblies and pantheon of heroes ' that qualify it as today 's ' opium of the people ' . ) <p> Eagleton traces the enduring drive to use culture to fill the gap between the elite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convictions back to Edmund Burke and the conservative response to the French Revolution : ' it is in reaction to that cataclysm that the notion of culture gathers a certain urgency ' . For Burke , culture speaks in ' moderate , even-tempered tones , whereas the voice of politics is rough and raucous ' . Later in the nineteenth century , in response to the sharpening class struggle in Victorian England , Matthew Arnold sought ' to deploy culture as a bulwark against social unrest ' . Though himself agnostic , Arnold attempted to recast religion in a ' degutted , demythologised ' form , in the hope that a ' gentrified Christianity ' would restore ideological authority over the ' lapsed masses ' . Eagleton condemns the ' unwitting intellectual dishonesty ' and ' bad faith ' of Arnold 's instrumental and cynical approach towards religion -- one which was upheld by Weber and Durkheim and is still influential today . <p> He wades through an hilarious assortment of leftists , philosophers , materialists , positivists , atheists , reluctant atheists , agnostics , deists who just ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , R ? gis Debray , Jacques Derrida , J ? rgen Habermas , Slavoj ? i ? ek , George Steiner , Roger Scruton , John Gray , Simon Critchley , August Comte , Edward Gibbon , Denis Diderot , JM Synge , Henrik Ibsen , Friedrich Nietzsche , Joseph Conrad , Matthew Arnold , Montesquieu , Hans Vaihinger , Leo Strauss , Emile Durkheim , Voltaire , John Toland . They do n't believe a word of it , of course , but , well , it might come in handy . The philosophers turn to theology in search of more productive questioning . The social scientists ca n't stop pressing religion into socially useful service -- to provide the ceremonial , the ritual , the cohesion , the unity , the discipline , the order , the sweetness and light , all of which appear to have gone out of the church window . And then there 's Alain de Botton who says he finds religion ' sporadically interesting , useful and consoling ' .

The Enlightenment philosophes were more concerned with challenging ecclesiastical authority than religious faith as such and most were believers of some sort . ' The decisive break ' came at the close of the nineteenth century , with Friedrich Nietzsche , ' the first real atheist ' . For Eagleton , the virtue of Nietzsche was his scorn for the diverse attempts to ' out-Christian ' Christianity , with cults of ' altruism , and philanthropy ' and ' suchlike humanitarian claptrap ' . ' For Nietzsche , these specious forms of religion were simply ways of dissembling over our deicide , and had to be swept away with the corpse . ' Though , as Eagleton notes , the idea ' that the death of God involves the death of Man , along with the birth of a new form of humanity , is orthodox Christianity , a fact of which Nietzsche seems not to have been aware ' . This provides yet another illustration of his opening point that ' atheism is by no means as easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to forge ' surrogate forms of transcendence , plugging the gap where God had once been ' , Eagleton observes that ' the Almighty has proved remarkably difficult to dispose of ' <p> Though Nietzsche had little influence in his own time , the emergence of postmodernism a century later , Eagleton argues , can be seen as ' a postscript to Nietzsche ' as ' human history arrives for the first time at an authentic atheism ' . Yet , in writing off religion , ' it also dismisses a good many other momentous questions as so much metaphysical illusion ' . Hence it is not surprising to find that the spiritual bankruptcy of the capitalist order is reflected in a resurgence of interest in religion , from diverse forms of fundamentalism to the Western supremacism and vulgar scientism of the New Atheists . It is reflected , too , in the postmodernists . They 've not only lost God , but also self and subject too . Are they bothered ?

He formally acknowledged 14 of them , though it 's believed he fathered up to 30 . He refused to ever live with any of his offspring . The mundane realities of parenthood would have represented a concession to convention too far for the last great bohemian artist . <p> The children he recognised include the fashion designer Bella Freud and writer Esther Freud . But even among this sprawling extended family , relations were sometimes strained . Some of those who enjoyed the benediction of paternal acknowledgement from this titan of the art world learned it was no substitute for sustained involvement or emotional investment in them . <p> But Freud was not shackled to any sense of duty to anyone or anything , except his art . He was as cavalier and profligate regarding his progeny as he was with his many , many lovers -- some were kept close , others treated as disposable . <p> Now , three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' forgotten ' Freud children , Paul Freud , has come forward to claim his share of the multi-million pound fortune his father left behind . One of four children Lucian fathered with the artist Katherine McAdam , Paul had no contact with his famous father after his mother , tired of his relentless infidelity , left him in the mid-1960s and moved to a council flat . None of these children was mentioned in the will , but now Paul is seeking financial restitution for the abandonment . <p> Parenthood , it seemed , was regarded by Freud as little more than a side-effect of his formidable libido . Emotional ties of any kind were treated as being a great deal less important than his work . He often showed indifference that bordered on cruelty , but never made any apologies for it . " It is very straightforward , " he said , " as very simply all I ever really want to do is to paint . I am very selfish about it . I say it not as a boast but a fact . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud , Lucian was born into a prominent family in pre-war Berlin , one of three boys born to Ernst Freud , an architect , and heiress Lucie Brasch . Family life at the Freuds was privileged if a little austere -- the children were largely raised by the family 's staff -- a litany of governesses and cooks . <p> When Hitler came to power in 1933 , the Freuds fled Berlin , securing a home in London after an associate made a petition on their behalf to the royal family . As a Jewish family , they had already borne witness to violence in Germany -- a cousin of theirs had been murdered by the Nazis . <p> In London , the young Freuds attended progressive schools , but the upheaval in their lives had done little to forge lasting bonds between the three siblings -- the boys were not close . Lucian , who wielded candour like a weapon , later said : " I was never friendly with either of my brothers . " He said he thought Stephen " was incredibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clement was not spared . " I always despised him because he was a liar , and I minded it . If you liked someone , you would n't have cared if they were a liar or not . He 's dead now . Always was , actually , " Freud said . <p> Nor was he close to his father , who did not encourage his talent for art . When he was young , Lucian remembered his father being " absolutely horrible about my work very early on . I thought : ' What a b*****d . ' " <p> His relationship with his mother was , if closer , similarly vexed . It was , in fact , uncomfortably close . And Lucian 's intensely private , guarded nature seems to have evolved in part as a means by which to evade her suffocating attention . <p> " I felt oppressed by her because she was very instinctive and I 've always been very secretive . It was hard to keep things from her . The idea of her knowing what I was doing or thinking bothered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He responded to the scrutiny by cutting off all contact with her for many years . Only when she was crippled with depression and recovering from a suicide attempt did he discover her to be sufficiently subdued to bear , and brokered a kind of peace . He met her daily for breakfast , and painted her portrait nine times . <p> Freud 's inherent iconoclasm and disdain for moral sanctimony found expression from an early age . In 1938 he was expelled from school after apparently dropping his trousers on a Bournemouth street . But even as a small boy he showed early promise as an artist . <p> At 17 , he sold his first work , a self-portrait , to a magazine . He abandoned his course at the Central School of Arts and Crafts after just a year , moving to East Anglia where he studied under Cedric Morris . <p> Even in the early years of his career , before he found critical acclaim and international fame , he seemed to seek out drama and turmoil as a kind of creative stimulus . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half a million pounds to the Kray brothers , and prone to brawling . He moved deftly between squalor and splendour , dividing his social life between London nobility and the most notorious figures of the city 's shadowy underworld . <p> His early romantic life , too , was no less colourful . In his youth , he threw himself headlong into sexual affairs with both men and women . When he was 19 , he began a tumultuous affair with Lorna Wishart , a married woman 11 years his senior . <p> Beautiful , liberated and free-spirited , Lorna was a doctor 's daughter who had married at age 16 . But family life had failed to suppress her unconventional nature , and her indulgent husband , Ernest Wishart , a renegade publisher and avowed communist , seemed to tolerate her sexual adventurism and colourful social life at the centre of London 's arts and literary scenes . <p> When Lorna met the teenage Freud , she <p> was ( though still married ) established as the mistress of Laurie Lee , who was already well-known as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given birth to a daughter by Lee , who was raised alongside her other children . According to their daughter Yasmine , Lorna was a born muse , " savage , wild , romantic and without guilt " . <p> For some time , she sustained affairs with Laurie Lee and Freud simultaneously , but both were too intense and obsessive in character for this to be workable for long . Lee , upon discovering his rival , wrote in his diary of Freud , " This mad unpleasant youth appeals to a sort of craving she has for corruption . She would like to be free of it but ca n't . <p> " Meanwhile , she says she loves me ... Oh , I ca n't express the absolute depths to which this has brought me . She goes to him when I long for her , and finds him in bed with a boyfriend . She is disgusted but she still goes to see him . " <p> Eventually , Freud and Lee ended up coming to blows over Lorna , getting embroiled in a physical fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won the brawl , Freud was to be the ultimate victor . Shortly after , Lorna broke up with the writer and seemed to commit further to Lucian , spending weekdays with him in his flat and returning to her husband and family in Sussex at the weekends . <p> Lucian , however , even at that young age , had already developed his wandering eye . When Lorna discovered love letters from a well-known actress addressed to him she became hysterical and ended the affair , pitching Lucian into despair . <p> He pursued her down to Sussex and found her at the home she shared with her husband . Despite a number of dramatic gestures , including firing a gun into the sky in their garden and riding up to the house on a white horse , Lorna was resolute . <p> She never returned to him , but instead converted to Catholicism and lived out the rest of her life in obscurity . She burned the many letters she had received from her two famous lovers , so that their contents would always remain private . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence . Soon after , in a move that echoed the obsessive loves of WB Yeats , he married Lorna 's niece Kitty Garman in 1948 . The couple split four years later , having had two daughters together . <p> It was not the first time his sexual conquests would span several generations of the same family . As a young man , he had an affair with the painter Janetta Wooley . Forty years later , he seduced her daughter Rose . <p> Freud seemed to require constant sexual activity in order to work . Sometimes , he fulfilled the classic clich ? and seduced his models , otherwise he recruited women from elsewhere to satisfy his appetites . Raymond Jones , one of his models , remembers of his time sitting for him , that their work was periodically interrupted by the arrival of a woman . <p> She and Lucien would slip into the bathroom briefly for noisy sex , while he waited . Before long , the woman would leave and the artist would return , refreshed , having bathed and sometimes buck naked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sculptor Vassilakis Takis , a friend of Freud , estimated that he had at least 500 lovers . " I think he needed to dominate women in certain ways ... he was almost animal . He went with his feelings , took what he wanted . That was his strength . You could also physically see it in his actions -- eating with his fingers , tearing birds to pieces on his plate . The usual social rules that we apply to ourselves , I do n't think he ever thought applied to him . " <p> Freud 's paintings , the artist said , were autobiographical -- a forensic rendering of some emotional truth between artist and subject . He claimed only once to have painted someone he did n't like , converting his real-life antipathy for Bernard Breslauer , a book dealer , onto the canvas by making him he said , " even more repulsive than he actually was " . <p> He painted with relentless and often unflattering directness , even when his subjects were famous models . He became friends with Kate Moss after she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn to her reckless , non-conformist nature and they used to go to nightclubs together . They made an odd pairing , the world-famous model and the grizzled old buzzard artist , still louche but now in his 80s . <p> But , as in his personal life , it was the way he related to his children through his art that attracted the most gossip and controversy . He persuaded six of his daughters and one of his sons to pose naked for him . Annie Freud , who was 14 at the time , remembers it as being , at the very least , an unsettling experience . <p> " I remember having long hair and wanting my hair to cover my nipples , and Dad would lean forward and move my hair away with his paintbrush , ' she said . ' It was full exposure . The issue was about someone having dominion over you . It was all quite shocking . <p> " There was some hurt done , not intentionally , and it was nothing to do with sex -- perhaps it was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very well for Dad to say it was all right . No one else felt that it was . " <p> Freud was , according to his second wife , Lady Caroline Blackwood -- to whom he was married for five years in the 1950s -- " not the sort of man one could have children with " . Unsurprisingly , they had none together . <p> But to be a child of Lucian Freud , it may be hard to know which was more troublesome : to live , like Paul Freud , far beyond the vulpine glare of his attention ; or , like Annie Freud , to squirm beneath it . <h> From the web <h> Sponsored Videos <h> Your Comments <p> COMMENT RULES : Comments that are judged to be defamatory , abusive or in bad taste are not acceptable and contributors who consistently fall below certain criteria will be permanently blacklisted .

Nick Gibb , the MP and former school 's minister claims it proves that progressive methods simply do not work <p> Next week 600,000 young children will be tested on their reading skillsPhoto : ALAMY ( POSED BY MODEL ) <p> Last Saturday Michael Gove , in his speech to the Policy Exchange think tank , asked how anyone can defend an education system where " more than a fifth of children leave primary school without having reached a basic level of literacy and numeracy " . As a nation , he said , we need " to commit to eliminating illiteracy and innumeracy to save lives that are currently wasted " . He is right . <p> Next week 600,000 five-and six-year-olds will be tested for their basic reading skills and their ability to decipher forty simple words . This is the Phonics Screening Check that was first introduced by the Coalition government as a pilot in 300 schools in June 2011 , and then annually in all primary schools in England from June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child can decode fluently and effortlessly and to spot those who need extra tuition . <p> The Check 's focus on phonics was influenced by a seven year research study in Clackmannanshire which demonstrated that teaching young children to read using a systematic synthetic phonics approach led to the children in the study having a reading age , on average , more than three years above their actual age by the time they left primary school . <p> Like many education reforms that challenge the education establishment , the introduction of the Phonics Check has not been welcomed by all . There remains a hard core of believers in the progressive " look and say " approach , where children learn whole words on sight and are then expected gradually to pick up the ability to recognise letter sounds . <p> The advocates of " look and say " are determined to continue the Reading Wars that have been fought both in this country and the United States since the 1950s , despite the huge and growing body of evidence in favour of phonics . <p> The Phonics Check consists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a one-to-one basis to their own teacher . The words range from the simple , " stop " and " chip " , to the more complex , " index " or " portrait " . Half of the words are not real , designed to ensure children have been taught to decode words using phonics . <p> Words such as " elt " or " sarps " or " groiks " can only be successfully read if the school has taught their pupils the sounds of the letters and how to blend them into words ; the essence of the synthetic phonics approach to teaching children to read . <p> The pass mark in last year 's Check was 32 out 40 words , read correctly to the teacher . Nationally , 69 per cent of pupils achieved that goal , a significant rise on the year before ( 2012 ) when 58% passed . <p> Those pupils who do n't reach the expected level are given extra tuition and take the test again the following year . <p> A recent study by Dr Marlynne Grant of a Catholic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the systematic phonics scheme , Sound Discovery , and was teaching pupils to read from the first weeks of the Reception class , reported that by July of the following year , the pupils had an average reading age of 8 years and 2 months , some 22 months above their actual average age of 6 years and 4 months . <p> And the boys were out-performing the girls ; addressing the stubborn problem of poor comparative performance by boys . Even more importantly , Dr Grant reported that the children were reading " with confidence and enthusiasm " . Schools all over England that adopt this approach could report similar outcomes . <p> Yet , many do not . There is a large disparity in results between different local authorities . One of the weakest is Liverpool where just 59 per cent of 6-year-olds passed the test last year . <p> Liverpool does have high levels of deprivation with 32 per cent of its primary school pupils eligible for free school meals , but then so does Newham , one of the poorest London boroughs with 33 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and three-quarters from families where English is not their first language .

" <p> The " variety of methods " approach makes learning to read a far more difficult task than needs to be the case .

This year 's phonic check will , I am sure , see another rise in the number of pupils achieving the pass mark as more and more schools are learning from the highly successful schools about how to teach children to read . <p> We wo n't , however , achieve the levels of literacy in this country that we need until all schools understand the research behind this debate and adopt methods that have been proven to work in Clackmannanshire , in Newham and throughout the independent sector .

After this win , Liverpool were odds-on to match Tottenham Hotspur 's 1960/61 record of 11 consecutive wins from the start of the season . However , a 1-1 draw at Norwich City in the ninth game put pay to this record . <p> Liverpool went on to win the next four matches in the league , including a very impressive 3-1 away win at White Hart Lane .

The same was said after the 1980/81 season when Liverpool finished fifth despite winning the European Cup . <p> That summer Liverpool sold three first team players and bought two ( Steve Nicol and Mark Lawrenson ) .

@@2582234 <h> The rise and fall of Wayne Rooney <p> Wayne Rooney is only the latest victim of England 's Messiah complex . <p> W <p> 20 June 2014 <h> Get spiked by email <p> What does it mean to be English ? It seems a simple question , but ask a dozen people on the Clapham omnibus and you 'll get a dozen different answers . Sporting invincibility ? Nah . Stiff upper lip ? Nah . We 've gone all emotional in recent years . Old maids cycling to Holy Communion through the morning mist ? Nah . We do cycle , but not to church . However , if there 's one enduring , archetypal English trait , it 's the urge to hype up our sporting heroes and then give them a damn good shoeing when they do n't deliver . In this respect , the story of Wayne Rooney is a case study in Englishness . <p> When Rooney exploded onto the international scene at Euro 2004 , we scattered rose petals at his feet . We thought he was the Messiah . The nation was gripped by Roo-mania . We chanted his name . We were consumed by Roo-mournia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the adoration has turned to catcalls . Roo-mania has been supplanted by Roo-moania . Our erstwhile saviour has become a scapegoat , the player to blame for all of England 's failings . <p> Admittedly , our adoration was always tempered by a strong vein of terrace irreverence . He played for Manchester United , therefore he was always going to cop a fair amount of abuse . He was mocked for his resemblance to Shrek , for his barrel-chested physique , for his predilection for ' mature ' hookers and for his hair transplant ( ' Who 's the Scouser in the wig ? ' ) . He was never going to be a catwalk model , but nor was he regarded as a good sporting role model . He had a dangerously short fuse , he swore at referees and he never seemed satisfied with his astronomical wages . <p> But while Rooney 's looks and character were called into question , no one doubted his footballing skills . For a decade , he was England 's most important player ; the national team 's main goal-scorer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheet . Until now , that is . For the first time in his international career , Rooney is no longer regarded as indispensable . His former club team-mate , Paul Scholes , recently suggested that Rooney might be past his sell-by date . ' There 's a chance he 's worn out ' , said Scholes . ' Wayne 's peak may have been a lot younger than what we 'd expect of footballers traditionally . Age 28 or 29 has been the normal " peak " . With Wayne , it could have been when he scored 27 league goals in 2011-12 when he was 26 . ' <p> The argument that Rooney is a busted flush is certainly one that is gaining currency . When England lost to Italy in their first World Cup match in Manaus last week , it was Rooney who was singled out for criticism . Although England were praised for their adventure and attacking brio , Rooney was widely slated for his sluggishness , the dereliction of his defensive duties and his failure to convert the one chance that fell to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he was n't the only player who could have performed better -- Steven Gerrard , for example , was invisible . Italian sports daily La Gazetta dello Sport described England as : ' Strong in attack , fragile in midfield , modest in defence . ' It was a brutal assessment , but a fair one . So why the narrow focus on Rooney 's performance ? It 's as though the nation , having invested so much hope and expectation in Rooney , has ferociously rounded on him for having fallen short of greatness . He 's not the saviour after all , so let 's stick the boot in . <h> Related categories <p> The fetishisation of a single individual in a team sport is typically English . We 've swallowed the Roy of the Rovers myth . We believe that one magical player can alchemise an entire team . Gary Neville , speaking in Rooney 's defence , quite rightly bemoaned our national fixation with heroic individuals . ' Our country love it , creating a drama around one player ' , said Neville . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around one player . It was Gascoigne from 1996 to 1998 , Beckham from 2000 to 2006 . From 2006 , it was Rooney and Beckham . Now it 's Rooney to 2014 . Unfortunately -- or fortunately , because he is a big player -- this time it 's Wayne Rooney . ' <p> It 's clear that Rooney has never really lived up to his ' White Pele ' billing . But it was always wrong to invest such faith in one man . Wayne Rooney was never going to single-handedly transform English football . He alone could never make English players more comfortable in possession of the ball . He was never going to succeed where Premiership youth academies had failed : in producing technically adept , tactically literate players . He was never Roy of the Rovers . He was never Hegel 's world-historical individual or Nietzsche 's ? bermensch .

@@2582238 <h> From its inescapable smell to its beguiling allure , Rob Beattie explains everything that no one bothers to tell you before you join the throngs on the riverbanks <p> Fishing may be the most popular participatory sport in the UK , but most people do n't have a clue what actually goes on out there on our rivers , lakes , and seas . <p> The average Briton has his or her fair share of preconceptions about fishing , of course . It 's boring . It 's always raining . Only old people go fishing . Only old blokes go fishing . The only fish you ever catch are tiny ( yet in every pond there is a giant pike big enough to swallow a swan whole ) . <p> So , in an effort to bridge the divide , here are my top ten things that no one tells you before you take up the UK 's favourite sport . <p> 1 . Everything smells <p> The fish smell . Your bait smells -- whether it 's mouldy old cheese paste , sweaty maggots on the turn ( which is when they get really ripe ) , fishmeal pellets or curry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything , your landing net and keep net will smell ( especially if you leave them in the sun ) . Your clothes will soon become a rag to wipe your hands on , so they 'll smell . Finally , and most incontrovertibly , you will smell . No matter how rigorously you try to scrub up , you just will . <p> First , no one will believe your fishy exploits , even if you have photographic proof . " Photoshop " , they 'll opine , with a smug smile before asking whether you called in on the fishmongers on the way home ( no matter that there are hardly any fishmongers left to call in on anymore ) . <p> Once those digs have subsided , you 'll become the unwanted recipient of unfunny double entendres relating to your ' tackle ' or the length of your ' rod ' , as well as having to suffer the perennial favourite : ' gosh that 's a big one ' . <p> You 'll also find yourself spending an inordinate amount of time defending your ' catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their heads and proclaim that they ' just ca n't see the point ' . However patiently you explain that you return any fish you catch gently to the water so they can fight another day , you 'll always be met with a disbelieving , shaking head . <p> 3 . The best time to go is early evening <p> To begin with , you 'll waste hours upon hours during the day , watching an unmoving float or static rod tip , pulling your line back and forth through the sensors on bite alarms to make sure they 're still working . No one tells you that all you have to do is turn up just after tea time and fish into darkness . Fish love evenings , especially after a bright , hot summer 's day spent lounging around -- it gets them going . <p> Very early mornings are good too , but whereas the fishing usually gets worse as the morning wears on , the fishing gets better as darkness falls . Win , win . <p> 4 . Prawns make an amazing bait <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that pheromone of fish attractant that will make giant carp , pike and bream hurl themselves onto the bank at your feet in sweet surrender . Many anglers spend hours in the kitchen rustling up home-made treats , while others follow the release of the latest scientifically concocted Frankenbaits in the hope that it will give them an edge . <p> After years of plumping for baits like sweetcorn , cheese , bread and luncheon meet , primarily because they were n't utterly disgusting to use , someone convinced me to give prawns a crack . Blimey , what a revelation . Those bad boys will catch almost anything that swims . <p> 5 . Beach fishing is n't for beginners <p> If you want to become disheartened about sea angling really quickly , try fishing from a beach on your first few times out . Unless you are unbelievably , four-leaf-clover lucky ( right kind of beach , right kind of year , tide doing exactly the right thing ) you 'll discover it 's an enormous , spectacular waste of time . <p> Instead , try your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copy and there 's very little casting involved -- just drop your bait over the side and wait your turn . Fish love piers and one will probably be along shortly to boost your confidence . <p> 6 . You do n't need perfect form to go fly fishing <p> Casting a fly properly is one of the most difficult skills an angler can learn . Or at least it is if you listen to fly fishing instructors . This is not to say they do n't have a point -- good technique will help you in the long run by allowing you to cast safely , more accurately and without tiring yourself out . However , the key thing for a beginner is to absorb enough technique so that you can get a fly to the fish -- say 10 to 20 metres out from the bank . If you have to break a few stylistic rules to get a bit of distance , so be it . ( Remember : if you think your form is bad , wait until you see some of the monstrous , cack-handed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anglers become obsessed with carp and think that the only way to catch one is to camp by the side of a large lake that 's known to contain a monster or three ( which will probably have names like Herman or Benson or Big Girl ) . They fish with three rods , a sophisticated rig of bite alarms , and cast their baits half a mile away . And they 're fundamentally wrong . <p> Lakes , ponds and rivers are full of beautiful fish that are worthy of anyone 's attention , so let 's hear it for roach , rudd , crucian carp , perch , bream and chub . And barbel . <p> 8 . There 's more to fishing than catching fish <p> It helps of course , but if you only go fishing to catch fish , then you 're missing the point . Instead , go to be close to nature , to sit in one place -- or several places -- so quietly that you blend in with your surroundings . Study the habitat , work out where the fish are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you fish well , you 'll probably catch a fish ; and if you do n't catch one , you 'll still have the satisfaction of having fished well . <p> 9 . Most fish can be caught under your rod tip <p> The biggest fish that many anglers ever catch will take a bait fished at their feet , so there 's no need to acquire competition-standard casting skills or spend loads of money on an expensive set up . Instead , try acquiring something else -- stealth . You 'd be surprised how much of a lost art this and how difficult many people find it to sit and do and say nothing . Once you can , you 'll find fish -- especially at dusk -- are quite happy to wander past your feet in a delightfully unconcerned way . And fish that are unconcerned are easier to catch . <p> 10 . Once you 're hooked , other sports will be spoiled <p> It does n't happen to everyone , but sometimes , when a new angler is making their way to the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , or watching a trout sip flies from the surface , or hearing the ' cloop ' of a carp doing the same , there 's a switch -- it 's deep inside all of us -- that just gets flipped . That 's it . Suddenly you 're an angler and no matter how many times you go fishing you 'll want to go again and no matter how many fish you catch ( or nearly catch ) it 'll never be enough .

Examples include the Luuuk banking fraud attack in January , in which a Trojan program was used to steal ? 500,000 from 190 victims , mostly in Italy and Turkey . The problem was discovered by Kaspersky Lab one week after it had begun , but the criminals were able to remove all traces of evidence that might be used to trace them . <p> Notably , the report states that 49% of consumers exhibit at least one risky behaviour which puts them at higher risk of financial fraud .

With the exception of the Netherlands ( 4% ) , the UK ( 9% ) and France ( 10% ) , consumers in high percentages ( 14%-37% ) use computers without security software or public computers for online banking or online shopping .

In Poland , 40% of consumers change their bank after a fraud , while in Russia the figure is 25% and the Netherlands 21% . Other countries in EMEA reported rates less than 20% . In the US , only 9% of consumers switch providers , and in Canada only 6% do so . <p> However , even in countries where consumers do not switch , the reduction in card usage that often follows a fraud incident can hit the revenue streams of card issuers .

Halley saw that he was not able to judge Harrison 's horological schemes and so passed him on to another expert , George Graham , a trusted clock- and instrument-maker who could judge Harrison 's ideas more easily . This was a crucial meeting , since Graham would become a key ally and supporter . <p> Once Harrison had produced his first sea clock , H1 ( with some help ) , Graham was instrumental in getting the scientific community behind it . H1 was shown in Graham 's workshop near the Royal Society ( then in Crane Court ) , and in 1735 Graham was a signatory ( with Halley and others ) of a certificate from the Royal Society that testified to the great promise it showed . Thereafter , Graham was a supportive voice , helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meetings until Graham 's death in 1751 . Access to London 's skilled artisans was also important in this period as Harrison developed and made his new designs . <p> It 's also noteworthy that , thanks in part to Graham 's support , relations between the Commissioners and John Harrison were positive and supportive for 25 years . Even his son William conceded ( in a letter to Stephen Demainbray ) that ' Till about the year 1761 , we had no difficulties to encounter besides those which nature threw in our way ; for until the Invention was brought to maturity , we were happy in the uniform countenance and protection of the Board of Longitude . ' What strikes me is the length of time this support went on as Harrison tried to get his timekeepers to work to his satisfaction so that they could be tested formally . <h> Manfacturing dissent <p> Beyond 1761 , relations between the Harrisons and the Commissioners were far more difficult . In William Harrison 's words , ' no sooner was it evident that we had succeeded , than by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has ever since acted , as if it had been instituted for the express purpose of preventing our Invention from being made useful to mankind . ' <p> William Harrison was no impartial witness , but his words ( in the same letter to Demainbray ) do convey the frustrations of what became very difficult dealings in resolving the success of his sea watch , H4 , and how it might become a navigational instrument available to all . This was a very different climate -- a new set of Commissioners discussing a changed agenda as H4 went through the Barbados trial and tests at the Royal Observatory , and the Board of Longitude began to worry about questions of replication . In this altered climate , the Harrisons and their supporters ( including James Short and others ) moved to publication and lobbying as part of a public appeal for what they saw as due reward under the 1714 Act . <p> Their strategies finally paid off in a parliamentary Act ( 13 Geo. 3 cap . 77 ) that awarded John Harrison ? 8750 ( ? 1250 short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it took the Harrisons and their supporters years of publication and work behind the political scenes to make this happen . <p> With this abbreviated version of John Harrison 's story in mind , it would be interesting to think about some of the questions one could ask today . How easily could an ' outsider ' gain such direct access to scientific experts and opinion-formers ? Can one imagine someone like this having 25 years of support before the anticipated solution was ready for testing ? And how might the move to public appeal through publication and lobbying work in the 21st century ? Maybe we 'll find out over the next few years . 
@@2593234 <p> Towards the end of last year Lisa Rodrigues , a longstanding chief executive of a large NHS mental health trust , was driving home from work when something harrowing happened . " I was getting some terrible stomach pains . I could n't see properly . I wanted to crash my car . I really had to try hard to stop myself doing that . " She made it home safely but says she " cried for three days and three nights " . <p> Rodrigues was in the midst of the first serious episode of clinical depression she had experienced in almost two decades but it was especially significant , she says , because the crisis point occurred weeks after she had made the decision to " come out " about her history of mental health problems . <p> That someone in such a senior management position in any organisation decides to talk openly about living with depression is rare and Rodrigues , 58 , whose most trying times were in her teens and early 20s , acknowledges that speaking out was difficult . As she talks about her work and career , the last 13 years of which have been as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mental health , substance misuse , learning disability and prison healthcare services , she exudes the fervour of someone determined to bring her own experiences to bear . <p> She says , as retirement approached , she realised that talking about being in a demanding , senior position with a history of depression could have value . " I was just about to leave the NHS and that I wanted to talk about the fact that being a leader does n't mean to say that you have to be perfect , " she says . <p> The idea that living with a mental illness would exclude someone from a job they were capable of doing needs to be challenged , she suggests . " My experience of learning to manage my own emotions and deal with what I 've just dealt with -- I think I 'm a better person for it without a doubt , " she adds . <p> Reactions to her coming out were mostly encouraging , but some people commented that she " was the very last person " they would have expected to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not on antidepressants are you ?

" If you 've got cancer and you come forward for treatment nobody judges you . To be frank I would be dead if I had n't taken antidepressants because I was so low . " <p> She argues that , despite some progress in recent years , it is stigma across society that is a primary cause of negative attitudes and also affects behaviour and the way mental health services are funded and organised . <p> " Why is it that mental health services in this country only get 12% of the resources that we have available , given that it is at least 25% of the disease burden ?

" We 've got the benefit changes affecting patients and so too the increase in prices for things and also the changes in housing benefit . So they 've got a triple whammy . When we are seeing them they 're more ill and tend to stay in hospital longer .

" For the next third of my life I will be campaigning about this stuff , " she replies . " I do n't want to be running it . I want to write about it .

@@2593236 <h> I 'm Sorry I Have n't A Clue What 's Wrong With Samantha <p> Last week it was announced that four sad people with no sense of humour , no discernable social skills , no life , no experience and no self-awareness had complained to the BBC about the lovely Samantha . For those of you who do n't listen to Radio 4 , ( shame on you ! ) , Samantha is the non-existent scorer on the epic long-running comedy panel show I 'm Sorry I Have n't A Clue . She appears in name only and her gentle but often slightly risqu ? exploits are relayed each week for the listener . <p> I 'm Sorry I Have n't A Clue is one of those things that makes Britain great . It 's a bastion of Britishness ; a quirky , eccentric , wonderful piece of radio that injects joy and happiness into the lives of 2.5 million Brits each week - and it has being going since 1972 . I 'm Sorry I Have n't A Clue demonstrates that the British are unique . Only we can truly understand the humour of a fictional ' game ' based on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can truly love a beautiful phantom woman called Samantha . <p> Jack Dee who took over from the legendary Humphrey Lyttleton as host in 2009 has threatened to quit the show . The other panellists are equally unhappy and may not continue if details of Samantha 's wonderfully varied life can no longer be revealed . The complaints to the BBC state that Samantha is demeaning to women . I 'm yet to find a woman who believes this - so I suspect the complainants were men . If they were men then , hey , get a life ! It 's people like you that ruin it for the rest of us ! <p> I 'm Sorry I Have n't A Clue is just a small part of BBC Radio 4 's long proud history of gentle comedy with added smut . It all started with an iconic wartime show called ' It 's That Man Again ' or ITMA which ran from 1939 to 1949 and kept people laughing on the Home Front as the bombs fell around them . Half the UK population listened to the show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every week by Mrs Mopp the cleaner was : ' Can I do you now , Sir ? ' You do not need a smutty mind to understand the roar of laughter this generated each week . <p> The late 1950s saw another gem , The Navy Lark , a sit-com based around life on a Royal Navy Frigate and starring Jon Pertwee and Leslie Phillips . This double-entendre-filled romp included episodes with titles such as ' Stuck Up The Inlet ' . In 1965 Round The Horne was launched , and gentle smut was liberally applied over every episode . But it really pushed boat out with its two incredibly camp resting-actor characters , Julian and Sandy , played by Kenneth Williams and Hugh Paddick . Now before you read the example quote from the show below , bear in mind that at this point homosexuality was still illegal in the UK : <p> The 1970s saw Hinge and Bracket , basically two lovely old ladies who happen to be played by Patrick Fyffe and George Logan . Example quotes from the show include : <p> HINGE : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " COUSIN EVELYN : " He was caught playing cards with his privates . " <p> Roll on to 1972 and we have I 'm Sorry I Have n't A Clue ; a panel show that took elements of all these previous hit shows and others including the faux na ? f The Men From The Ministry and the epically brilliant Just a Minute and created one of the most innovative pieces of radio that has ever been produced anywhere in the world . <p> Regardless of one 's smug-tolerance levels , who in their right mind can object to any of the following ? <p> " Samantha , ca n't be with us today as she 's away helping an elderly neighbour clear out for a house move . This morning she sorted his box room and later she 's going to join him in the attic to have a good rummage in his trunks . " <p> " In her spare time , Samantha likes nothing more than to peruse old record shops . She particularly enjoys a rewarding poke in the country section . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admire the contestants in the caber competition , and perhaps have a go at tossing one or two herself ... " <p> And let 's face it , if the show ever got canned we 'd not only lose the lovely Samantha and the talents of all the great panellists over the years , be losing a whole history of comedy gems . Here are just a few : <p> Barry Cryer : " You 've been turning this back , you little clock-teaser ! " <p> So , suffice to say , I 'm with Jack Dee on this one . Samantha goes and I go too . <p> And with that , as the late , great Humphrey Lyttleton once said : " As the great tit of time nibbles through the gold top of eternity , and the unseen mouse droppings of fate nestle in the Crunchy Fruit and Nut muesli of destiny ... " ... I bid you farewell .

@@2604234 <p> A quiet change is sweeping over global health . Surgery , previously an exclusive service for rich urban dwellers , is now being acknowledged as a human right . It is an exciting time for global surgeons . The neglected stepchild of global public health is slowly but surely being accepted into the primary healthcare family . <p> In 2009 , I worked as a medical officer in a primary health centre in rural India . On a bright Saturday afternoon , a lady was brought in with severe abdominal pain and fever . With the limited resources I had , I made a probable diagnosis of acute appendicitis and referred her urgently to a bigger hospital , located five hours away . Unfortunately , the rains had washed away the roads and she could not be transported . The lady died from a completely treatable condition . I will never forget how frustrated I felt that day , especially knowing that this was a common story in rural areas globally . <p> The World Health Organisation ( WHO ) estimates that approximately 2 billion people do not have access to surgery . According to a report published in 2008 , only 3.5% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The burden of disease caused by treatable surgical conditions amounts to 401 million disability-adjusted life years ( DALYs , a measurement of the burden of the disease ) , more than that caused by malaria , tuberculosis and HIV/Aids together ( 214 million DALYs ) . Since DALYs represent the number of healthy years lost due to disability or death , these figures translate into huge economic losses . <p> In 2007 WHO director-general Dr Margaret Chan included essential and emergency surgery in her agenda to improve primary healthcare . Ever since , global surgery has been gaining ground . This was most clear in January 2014 , when World Bank president Dr Jim Yong Kim outlined the need for globalisation of surgery , calling it the " indivisible , indispensable part of healthcare " . <p> There is resistance to considering surgery a part of essential health services , mainly due to a perception that it is complex and expensive to establish and practice . No doubt the initial cost of establishing a surgical practice is high . However , multiple studies globally have confirmed that essential surgery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact , in some countries it has been estimated that the cost per year of a life saved through surgery is comparable to that saved by the measles vaccine . So the economic benefits alone can outweigh the initial investment . Pioneering setups such as that in Narayana ( Hrudalaya ) Health Groups in India , established by Dr Devi Shetty , have repeatedly demonstrated that unit costs come down the more surgery is practiced . <p> The other major barrier in globalisation of surgery is lack of human resources . Surgical training is long and labour-intensive . Once surgeons are trained , most of them establish their practices in urban areas or leave the country altogether , creating a vacuum that is often filled by unskilled professionals . This can be partly addressed by scaling up training , incentivising surgeons to work in areas with the most need and by delegating simple procedures to non-physicians . In 2005 WHO established the Global Initiative for Emergency and Essential Surgical Care , with the goal of reducing essential surgery-related morbidity and mortality . It has made available toolkits , reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimum standards and technologies necessary to establish surgery as a part of primary healthcare practice . <p> Moulding evidence-based practices into achievable and sustainable goals at the local level is the key step . Pilot projects that can be scaled up have been the backbone of all public health practices . Global surgery will be no exception . Now what is needed is for governments and donors worldwide to recognise and invest in national health systems to integrate essential and surgical healthcare into primary care practices . <p> With the right will , the right policies , right research and a multi-sectoral approach , providing safe and quality surgery as a primary health service is an achievable goal globally . <p> Sristi Sharma is a physician from India and a graduate from Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health .

The deal built on the previous relationship that involved DRG repping NRK 's scripted formats .

@@2604240 <p> The growing clout of asset managers could present risks to market stability , according to a report by the Bank of International Settlements ( BIS ) . <p> The report argues portfolio managers are evaluated on the basis of short-term performance while revenues are linked to fluctuations in customer fund flows . " These arrangements can exacerbate the pro-cyclicality of asset prices , feeding the market 's momentum in booms and leading to abrupt withdrawals from asset classes in times of stress , " read the report . <p> It warned growing concentration in the asset management space could weaken the market 's ability to deal with stress . " Another concern arising from concentration is that operational or legal problems at a large asset management company may have disproportionate systemic effects , " it read . <p> Nonetheless , the same paper is not wholly negative and points out asset managers can bring about market stability by " strengthening market based financial intermediation ( which ) can provide a complementary channel to bank-based funding for businesses and households . In fact , the growth in asset management company 's portfolios mirrors the rebalancing of funding of the real economy away from banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a strength to the extent that one might compensate for supply problems in the other , " read the report . <p> The $60 trillion asset management industry is facing a number of regulatory challenges with industry experts expressing alarm that some large firms could be labelled as systemically important financial institutions or SIFIs . The Financial Stability Oversight Council ( FSOC ) , the US government agency mandated under Dodd-Frank to monitor systemic risk , has proposed that some asset managers including hedge funds , be designated as SIFIs in what could lead to further heavy-handed regulations . <p> FSOC is reportedly assessing whether Blackrock and Fidelity in particular should be classed as SIFIs . Critics point out that the failure of an asset manager would most likely only hurt its investors while a bank default would harm depositors , borrowers and others dependent on a source of liquidity . If the FSOC adopts a tough approach , it could see large asset managers subjected to bank-style capital , leverage , liquidity and reporting rules at a time when operational costs are rapidly mounting for the industry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shadow banking system . A consultation paper by the Financial Stability Board ( FSB ) and the International Organisation of Securities Commissions ( IOSCO ) recommended " materiality thresholds " to identify SIFIs . The FSB and IOSCO set a threshold of $100 billion in assets and an alternative threshold between $400 billion and $600 billion gross national exposure for hedge funds it deemed as SIFIs . <p> Both the Alternative Investment Management Association ( AIMA ) and Hedge Fund Standards Board ( HFSB ) have both opposed the FSB and IOSCO findings and have reportedly suggested the US definition of a major swap participant under Dodd-Frank be used to identify SIFIs instead . <p> Hedge fund surveys conducted by the UK 's Financial Conduct Authority ( FCA ) and its precursor the Financial Services Authority ( FSA ) have long said hedge funds individually are unlikely to pose a systemic risk although one paper in 2012 warned a rapid fire-sale of hedge fund assets in distressed market conditions would impact liquidity and efficient pricing , which could potentially be a systemic risk . Long Term Capital Management ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990s is often cited as evidence that hedge funds pose a systemic risk , although managers ' use of leverage has diminished markedly since then . The FCA , for example , found the median leverage at most hedge funds to be 4.2 times their Net Asset Value ( NAV ) . <p> While hedge funds should not be deemed SIFIs , the largest managers are gaining the lion 's share of investor assets , which could lead to concentration risk . The FCA 's survey of hedge fund managers in March 2014 found the 20 largest hedge funds in the UK controlled 82% of the $470 billion in assets managed out of the country .

@@2612234 <h> Close encounters of the 3D kind : the resurgence of post-converted 3D <h> Native 3D vs post converted 3D : the results may surprise <p> Shares <p> The process of converting 2D film to 3D movies has a reputation for turning out an inferior product - mainly because the first filmmakers to use this process made such a bad job of it . <p> Clash of the Titans has been widely regarded as such a botch job ( due to a studio 's insistence on 3D and a director having no time to make the post production process work ) it was felt that true 3D was the only way forward for the technology . That was until James Gunn spoke out . <p> Gunn is the brilliant director of the upcoming Summer blockbuster Guardians of the Galaxy . He cut his directing teeth on the subversive and hilarious horror fare Slither and is well known for his honesty about the filmmaking process . <p> In a recent Facebook post he proclaimed that though Guardians of the Galaxy was a post-converted 3D movie , the end result may actually surpass native 3D . <p> " 3D conversion was once far inferior to shooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology has allowed us incredible control over the 3D effects , making it equal to or in some cases greater than shooting in 3D , " said Gunn . <p> Guardians of the Galaxy 's post-converted 3D ' better than native 3D ' <p> A bold claim indeed but his thoughts marry up with the way the movie industry is going . Take the visual effects of Oscar winner Gravity . They were post-converted into 3D but the movie 's makers believe it is a true 3D movie because of the techniques they used . It seems that 3D in post is fast becoming not just the acceptable face of 3D in movies but the preferred one . <h> The changing face of 3D <p> " I think it 's changing with a lot of filmmakers. 3D conversion and native 3D filming are both seen as viable tools by the film industry , " said Tim Bennison , Chief Operating Officer of Gener8 , a stereoscopic 3D conversion company . <p> " I think the conversation is changing from ' conversion is bad , native 3D is best ' to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' For example , a recent trend is hybrid native-converted 3D films for which individual sequences are pre-planned to either be shot native 3D or converted , within the same film , depending on the needs of the production . " <p> Before Bennison became part of Gener8 , he worked at videogame studio Radical Entertainment , where he oversaw several award-winning videogames including Prototype . With so many CGI heavy movies being released now , this was perfect grounding for working in the 3D post-conversion business . <p> Gener8 worked on the production of Godzilla , among other movies <p> " At Gener8 , we are the only major conversion company that uses a ' virtual native 3D ' process , " he notes . " We reconstruct a CGI 3D version of every frame of every shot using our proprietary technology . We can then ' film ' the shot virtually by rendering it with a synthetic two-lens camera rig , which simulates the optics of a real native 3D rig . We then finalise the shots by removing optical artefacts using proprietary computer vision techniques . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect . On Prometheus for example , even I ca n't tell which shots were natively-filmed and which shots were converted by Gener8 . " <h> Are you a post convert ? <p> Not everyone is convinced , though . There are a number of filmmakers out there that believe 3D should be shot using 3D cameras . A recent example of this is Amelie director Jean-Pierre Jeunet . His latest film , The Young and Prodigious T.S . Spivet , has been shot natively in 3D and he has strong words about badly post produced efforts . <p> " I think Hollywood is killing 3D , " he said at the 3D Creative Summit in London back in March , pointing a finger at the World War Z and explaining that fast action just does n't suit the 3D format . <p> Bennison believes that , despite Jeunet 's reticence , the perception of 3D in post is changing and it is thanks to vast improvements in technology . <p> 3D in post is getting a whole lot better , reckons Gener8 <p> " Anyone who loves 3D film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creative improvements we are making in the 3D conversion process , " he said . <p> " You might be surprised how complementary conversion and native 3D can be to support the creative vision of a film . We are hearing from more and more directors that they would never consider doing 3D with having conversion as at least part of their toolbox . " <h> Faking it <p> According to Real Or Fake 3D , there are 25 " real " 3D movies that have been launched throughout 2014 , those that have been rendered natively or shot on 3D , compared to just 11 that have been post converted . <p> Expect more " real " 3D films to be made too . IMAX has just released a new 3D camera that 's easier and lighter for filmmakers to use - the fruits of its footage can be seen in the new Transformers movie.With native 3D becoming easier to shoot , just how will post-produced 3D survive ? The answer seems to lie in working with directors through the entire production process , regardless if the camera has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3D camera to film Transformers <p> " Clearly when a movie is planned from the start to be 3D , the result is better , " said Bennison . " What we 're seeing now is that pretty much all movies with a 3D release are planned properly from the start of pre-production , and we are directly involved in this planning . <p> " We 're seeing two scenarios when we work with the client . One approach is we work with a stereographer employed by the film production who collaborates with our Stereographic Supervisor on creative direction for the 3D , as well as approving individual shots . <p> " The other approach , which is becoming more common , is the Director or Executive Producer works directly with our Stereo Supervisor on setting creative direction , and relies on us to approve shots to theatrical final quality . " <p> Many would argue that many movies post-produced in 3D do n't actually need the effect . This may well be the case for some , but Bennison believes that for this perception to change we just need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the script ; a punctuation mark that moves beyond the screen . <p> " 3D is just one of the many tools at the disposal of the film maker and definitely is not necessary for all films . But there is a lot of scope to explore the possibilities of 3D to enhance storytelling in a much wider variety of film genres than we 're currently seeing . <p> " The 3D effect should ebb and flows with the action , in front of the screen and behind the screen , just like the music ebbs and flows . No one would argue that music is not instrumental to storytelling . I would argue that properly-planned 3D can have a similar supporting role in storytelling . " 
@@2612235 <h> What is FGM ? Everything you need to know about female genital mutilation <p> More than 125 million women are thought to be currently living with the consequences of FGM Rex <p> A report published by MPs this week stated that medical professionals who fail to report that girls in their care have suffered female genital mutilation ( FGM ) should be prosecuted . <p> The procedure , which is believed to have affected about 170,000 women and girls living in Britain , has been illegal since 1985 , but the first prosecution only occurred this year . <p> As the world works to stamp out this abuse , here 's everything you need to know about FGM . <p> What is it ? <p> Female genital mutilation , sometimes referred to as female circumcision , incorporates a number of procedures that intentionally alter or cause injury to the female genital organs without medical necessity . <p> What do the procedures entail ? <p> There are four major types of FGM as identified by the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) . These are : <p> 1 . Clitoridectomy : partial or total removal of the clitoris . <p> 2 . Excision : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labia ( lips that surround the vagina ) , with or without removal of the labia majora ( larger outer lips ) . <p> 3 .

Other harmful procedures to the female genitalia for non-medical purposes , including pricking , piercing , incising , scraping and cauterizing the genital area . <p> Who is at risk ? <p> FGM is mostly carried out on young girls sometime between infancy and the age of 15 , although adult women are also affected . The practice is mainly found in 29 countries in Africa and the Middle East , where more than 125 million women are thought to be currently living with the consequences of FGM . <p> In Africa in particular , more than three million girls are estimated to be at risk of being cut each year . <p> Who carries out the procedure ? <p> In many communities where FGM is prevalent , there is a traditional circumciser . However , more than 18 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the trend towards medicalisation is increasing . <p> What are the health risks ? <p> The WHO states that there are no health benefits to FGM -- removing and damaging healthy female genital tissue interferes with the natural function of women and girls ' bodies . The health consequences can be high-risk and vary from immediate problems to long-term , damaging effects . <p> The initial procedure can result in severe pain , shock , bleeding , tetanus or sepsis ( bacterial infection ) , inability to urinate , open sores in the genital region and injury to nearby genital tissue . <p> But girls are also at risk of abnormal periods , recurrent bladder and urinary tract infections , cysts , pain during sex and lack of sexual pleasure , infertility , childbirth problems and new-born deaths .

During Ramadan , Muslim people only eat two meals per day , once before sunrise ( sehar ) and one after sunset ( iftar ) . <p> Should all Muslims fast during Ramadan ? <p> The Islamic law states that the ' sick ' can be exempt from fasting for one or all 30 days and give money to the poor , but some Muslims with diabetes may not perceive themselves as being ' sick ' and will choose to fast .

Though extreme poverty remains widespread , the MDGs have made a huge contribution , particularly in public health , where dramatic progress has been made . <p> With 2030 as the target date , the SDGs will focus on ending extreme poverty worldwide .

Then it is time to take a deep breath and brave the full effect of being up 356m ( 1,168ft ) with no handrail and on a grated metal walkway where you can see everything below . What a thrill , walking out onto the platform ! The view was stunning . The edge was so close , but I was n't bothered as much as I had expected . I was fully strapped in and going no further than the rope allowed . I was the first to have my toes poking out over the edge , looking straight down .

There is nothing to equal being pushed to your personal limits . Next I was hanging over forwards , even standing on tiptoes . The 30 minutes that I was up there seemed to fly by , but I was certainly buzzing by the time I made it back down to ground level . Participants do n't leave the EdgeWalk empty handed .

She thrust down her fan , behind which she had been coquettishly giggling with a courtier , rose from her throne and strode towards the woman who had dared to enter her chamber . <p> And when Queen Elizabeth I reached the Countess of Leicester she soundly boxed her ears and screamed : " Get out ! " <p> The new countess fled and was never to appear at court again . Her crime was to be the second wife of the man Elizabeth adored . <p> Lord Robert Dudley had tried for years to marry the captivating and tempestuous Queen and now , fed up and resigned to the fact she would never consent to the match he had tried so ardently to bring about , he had married a young relative of Elizabeth 's called Lettice Knollys .

And their open flirtation nearly cost Elizabeth her crown . <p> " Many believed them to be lovers in the fullest sense and Elizabeth soon became aware of proliferating rumours that she was no virgin at all and that she had secretly borne Lord Robert children . I use the word affair and it certainly caused a lot of gossip , " adds Weir . <p> During the course of her research Weir found eyewitness reports and diplomatic accounts , much of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not improved when Dudley 's first wife Amy Robsart was found dead at the foot of a flight of stairs in 1560 .

" But few believed him innocent and there were even whispers that the Queen had been an accomplice . Soon however Dudley was back by her side and with daily access to his Queen thanks to his job in the royal household . <p> But although Elizabeth loved Dudley she certainly did not want to marry him , or any other man . The reason , suggests Weir , goes back to a childhood that would have been considered highly dysfunctional in modern terms . Elizabeth hated the idea of marriage . <p> Joseph Fiennes and Cate Blanchett as Dudley and the Queen in the 1998 film Elizabeth POLYGRAM <p> There were rumours that she was no virgin at all <p> This is understandable when you consider that her father was Henry VIII and her mother was his second wife Anne Boleyn whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her stepmothers did n't fare so well either .

" She lived on her nerves and at one time a dozen ambassadors were paying court on behalf of their masters . Two foreign princes kept at it for more than 13 years . " There was more to her flirtation than mere coquetry . <p> " In part Elizabeth was using her flirtatious nature to protect her kingdom and keep friendly with other monarchs who might make war on her , " says Weir .

" This would have given him national influence while a son may have made her position on the throne look weaker still . And Elizabeth was determined not to be sidelined . <p> This helps explains why she famously played up all the qualities in herself that were manly . Weir agrees she was certainly ahead of her time in that regard but there was more to her than an early feminist streak . <p> Like her mother Anne , Elizabeth liked to tease men . " They both had sex appeal and charisma and she had inherited a certain French charm from Anne 's time at the French court . She was witty and loved music and dancing . " <p> But Dudley was the only man who raised her feelings to the ardour of true and long-lasting love , both at its passionate outset and its comfortable later coupling .

Encouraged by the amazingly knowledgeable and enthusiastic Innika ( another West Australia export ) we ordered six sharing dishes : each was a blissful discovery .

Black pepper soft shell crab tempura had to be eaten with the fingers . Truth to tell , there was more tempura than crab here , but the batter was fabulously delicate , burnt with a soy and honey sauce . The oddest dish by far was ( deep breath ) Nasu Dengaku sticky miso grilled aubergine with candied walnuts -- six fat , boiling-hot aubergine wedges cooked with miso , murin , sugar and sake in a bain-marie until their insides had melted almost to liquid .

From what I saw , there was a small area where Kimi 's car did punch a hole through the Armco ; this meant that if another car had hit that spot , it could have peeled back a large section of guardrail by " hooking " the edge of the hole with its bodywork , both resulting in a major repair job to replace several meters of barrier , and having a good chance of impaling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where we 're used to delays to fix safety barriers , the stewards made the right call in halting the race to fix the Armco ( and the track workers did a spectacular job of getting it done quickly ; an hour 's delay to fix a section of Armco barrier is about the quickest I 've seen ) .

@@2620237 <h> Armillo review : a good example of Nintendo 's growing presence in the indie game market <p> Developed by Fuzzy Wuzzy Games , Armillo is a 3D platform-puzzler fortified with plenty of action . From the central premise of rolling at speed through to the frequent freeing of small creatures from their prisons , it 's unmistakably inspired by the early Sonic games , fused with elements from Super Monkey Ball . <p> An invasion of his homeworld sees our hero set off across galaxies to set the universe to rights , and controlling Armillo on this journey feels refreshingly natural from the outset . Rolling through courses , smashing obstacles and collecting blue orbs will be comfortingly familiar for any gamer , and while following the collectibles and speed arrows will usually show you the path to the level 's end , there are a commendable number of extras planted on each world that keep things captivating for multiple playthroughs . <p> Collecting more orbs allows you to spend them in the game 's shop , acquiring added health segments and extra lives that become necessary as the difficulty curves upwards on later planets . <p> There are clever plays on perspective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the inevitable fire/ice levels . Some levels revert to two dimensions , where the game 's slightly imprecise jumping mechanism does become problematic . In addition to this , the game also suffers from frame rate drops , mainly when the screen gets busy . Hopefully these issues can be patched in the future . <p> It 's interesting to see the Wii U scoring a timed exclusive with Armillo , a move that emphasises Nintendo 's growing presence in the indie game market - a good example of how small developers can use an effective digital distribution model to bring their titles to greater attention . Armillo typifies a lot of what is best about indie development , but perhaps retains some of the flaws inherent in its retro inspirations.

The oil and gas sector , centred on Aberdeen , has been buoyant all the way through the recession , so much so that the city has appeared at times to be in its own economic bubble . The picture on employment in oil and gas should also remain strong in years to come , partly due to firms taking on more skilled engineering staff to help them reach the reserves of oil and gas in the North Sea that are increasingly hard to tap . <p> Loading article content <p> So why is Chevron laying off staff ?

Not only is the firm offering new jobs , but the creation of its new centre , which will work on the design and building of production facilities for companies working in oil and gas and other industries , is an encouraging sign in a sector that needs to grow further . The jobs at Doosan Babcock are the kind Scotland needs if its manufacturing sector is to thrive . <p> As far as the bigger picture on employment is concerned , however , there are still two persistent problems that the news from Doosan Babcock will do little to solve . <p> The first is underemployment , which existed before the recession but has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands of Scots wanting to work more but unable to do so .

Content marketing is the process of a brand 's deviation from self-serving messaging in order to provide relevant and valuable information to their consumers . Like content marketing , Gossage 's vision saw brands chartering communities built on like-interests , galvanising their advocates through incentive . <p> While his theory eventually proved successful , the conversation -- and message -- Gossage was referencing has become wildly diverse and Orwellian in nature due to the way in which Americans consume personalised media .

Their process , beautifully documented here , involves extracting popular forum topics and assembling them into a coherent , and often visual , post . While brands do n't share the flexibility in content , the same mining process can still be used . <p> For instance , start building keyword lists that define your brand 's service , product or value .

This allows Upworthy to determine which headline drives the best engagement before officially publishing a post , in some cases even testing headlines once that post has gained traction . Over time , that testing leads to greater insights on what resonates with your audience . <p> While Buzzfeed and Upworthy make great case studies to boosting traffic , it 's important to distinguish quality versus quantity , and in content marketing 's case , readers versus traffic .

Thankfully her case was thrown out , but her arguments illustrate the chronic weakness of any suggestion that we must allow the burka to be worn in public . <p> First , there is no religious requirement on Muslims to don the burka ; second , the burka is not a feature of Pakistani culture , where 90 per cent of women do not wear it ; third , there is no unqualified human right to wear whatever we want in public . In every developed society , personal freedoms have to take account of wider social mores . <p> The French ban has proved to be legally sound as well as sensible . I have long believed that the same measure should be introduced here in the UK to prevent community separatism and social apartheid . And , like the ECHR , I see no basis for the pretence that there is any religious sanction for the burka @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ custom originating in ancient Persia and Byzantium , more than 1,000 years before the birth of Islam . It was upheld by male aristocrats because of social snobbery rather than religion , since they did not want their womenfolk -- wives , daughters , sisters or mothers -- to be seen by the peasantry . <p> According to Dr Hargey , everyone in Britain , including Muslims , should oppose the insidious spread of the burka , which he says imprisons women , threatens social harmony , fuels distrust , has grave health implications and is a potent security risk <p> Nor is there any evidence in the Koran to support the wearing of the burka . Indeed , the Holy Book stipulates that men ' should lower their gaze ' when meeting women to avoid lecherous staring ( verse 24 , chapter 30 ) . So logically , if women were fully covered up there would be no need for such an instruction . <p> Some Muslim clergy claim that the burka is religiously necessary . They assert this because the Prophet Muhammad 's wives allegedly hid their faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their theological misrepresentations on the Koran but on the subsidiary and suspect hadith ( a collection of books containing the reputed sayings of Muhammad , written 250 years after his death ) . <p> ' It is forbidden for Muslim women going on pilgrimages to Mecca to cover their faces . So if such a pre-Islamic practice is banned in Islam 's holiest site , why on earth would it be required on the streets of Britain ? ' <p> In any case , this is a wilful misreading of scripture . In fact , verse 32 of chapter 33 in the Koran explicitly states that ' the Prophet 's wives are not like other women ' . So there is no reason to emulate them . <p> Just as revealingly , it is forbidden for Muslim women going on pilgrimages to Mecca to cover their faces . So if such a pre-Islamic practice is banned in Islam 's holiest site , why on earth would it be required on the streets of Britain ? <p> The truth is that there is no theological foundation for these separatist face masks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the leading institution of Muslim theology in the Islamic world , declared that the burka has no spiritual authenticity . <p> Theology apart , there are many other compelling arguments against the burka . It badly undermines social cohesion by inhibiting effective interaction between Muslims and non-Muslims in the public realm . There can be no meaningful exchange with people if you can not even see their faces . <p> Moreover , the burka is an affront to the concept of gender parity in the UK . <p> If I tried to wear a ski-mask on a bus or at a bank , I would quickly be told to remove the item or leave , or be arrested . Why should the same rules not apply to Muslim women ? <p> Dr Hargey 's proposals for a nationwide prohibition would deal with all types of facial covering , including balaclavas <p> The demand for equal rights has always been central to the feminist cause , and in this case feminists should be calling for men and women to be treated equally . Either everyone has the right to mask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge implications for security , after several cases of terrorists and criminals using the burka to evade detection -- a particularly worrying development given the explicit , bloody threats of militant extremists . In our troubled world , there can be no absolute right to anonymity in public . <p> ' We can not continue to accept the creeping Arabisation of Islam in the UK and consequent destruction of our cherished British freedoms . A stand must be made now ' <p> Another concern is the health risks , for full coverings mean a distinct lack of exposure to sunshine . One recent study of 203 burka-clad women in the United Arab Emirates revealed that all but four were deficient in Vitamin D. <p> If that can happen in a land of blazing heat , how much worse will be the problems in often damp , dark Britain ? Our society is already seeing rises in rickets and other bone-related diseases for the first time since World War II . <p> Supporters of the burka talk about freedom of choice -- yet it is not women who are being given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That is not empowerment but imprisonment . <p> The burka is just another weapon in the jihadist arsenal of misogyny , like forced marriage , female genital mutilation and sexist discrimination . It should have no part in British society , where women are supposed to be treated as equal citizens . By tolerating it , we are allowing a form of gender apartheid to grow in our midst . <p> All of us , Muslims and non-Muslims alike , have a duty to challenge the religious hardliners who have cynically exploited British traditions of tolerance and individual liberty to pursue their own twisted sectarian agenda imported wholesale from the Arab Middle East . <p> A start could be made by forcing our politicians to debate the issue by gathering sufficient signatures for our historic anti-burka petition . <p> We can not continue to accept the creeping Arabisation of Islam in the UK and consequent destruction of our cherished British freedoms .

Businesses will also be assessed to determine whether consumers are given the possibility to withdraw consent to cookies at any time , and their compliance with data security obligations and protection of sensitive data stored in cookies will also be monitored , it said . <p> Businesses may be issued with sanctions if they are found to be in breach of the law , CNIL warned . <p> " CNIL is giving businesses every chance to comply with the ' cookie law ' requirements , " Paris-based data privacy expert Annabelle Richard of Pinsent Masons , the law firm behind Out-Law.com , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that forceful with companies regarding their compliance with the EU 's Privacy and Electronic Communications ( e-Privacy ) Directive since those rules were implemented in France , and indeed is waiting nearly a year since it issued guidelines to help business comply before following up with a concerted compliance monitoring scheme .

Other tools provided explain how the rules apply to different types of cookies and allow website operators to make use of template coding for their own sites , " Richard said . <p> " With this new warning about the forthcoming compliance monitoring scheme , businesses are being given a last chance to get compliant .

@@2658238 <p> Jos ? Saramago submitted the manuscript of Skylight to a Lisbon publisher in 1953 . Receiving no response , and apparently never seeking one , he was plunged , says his wife Pilar del Rio in her introduction , " into a painful , indelible silence that lasted decades " . He did , however , make a reputation as a journalist and editor before he returned to writing fiction in 1977 . In 1989 , having published three novels , he was at work on a fourth when the publisher to which he had sent Skylight wrote to say that they had rediscovered the manuscript and it would be an honour to print it . Saramago went at once and brought it home . His wife tells us that he never read it and said only that " it would not be published in his lifetime " . We must assume that he said nothing about what was to be done with it after his death . <p> An old humiliation might be at the root of his neglect of the manuscript , or perhaps , given his late second start , he did n't want to spend time on a return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think his wife 's decision to publish it now was sound . Not only does it illuminate the slow development of a radically original artist , but it is an interesting novel in its own right . The translator is the irreproachable Margaret Jull Costa . <p> Had the manuscript been accepted , and successful , would Saramago have kept the fine indifference to opinion that let him gradually discover his own incomparable idiom , style and subject matter ? There 's no telling . <p> Paragraphed and punctuated conventionally , Skylight follows a familiar fictional formula : a set of characters thrown together in one place at one time . In this case it 's a small working-class apartment house in Lisbon around 1950 , and six flats , 15 people , 10 of them women . Their lives are fragile , frugal , hard . Adriana and Isaura just manage to support their mother and aunt . In the evening , all four women listen with yearning intensity to Beethoven on the radio , while young Claudinha next door plays jazzy ragtime . Claudinha 's parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish wife loathe each other . Brutish Caetano and diabetic Justina , haunted by the loss of her child , go past hatred into open violence . <p> The explicit sexuality of the book ( which may have kept it from being considered for publication in Salazar 's Portugal in 1953 ) is remarkable now only because it is so compassionate . Saramago 's sympathy with the two sisters whose sexual desire can find no outlet is deep and subtle , as is his respect for Lidia , the kept woman who , while despising her keeper , respects her own professionalism in the most despised of professions . By a stunning reversal of erotic power , Saramago even manages to redeem the tiresome , porny cliche of a woman responding to rape with passion . <p> Frustration , moral squalor , insecurity , all at close quarters , inevitably breed competition and malice . Moving from character to character , the loosely plotted story includes a good deal of mean-spirited evildoing , quite in the tradition of Balzac and the naturalists . It also includes dry humour , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visionary : <p> " Then they had supper . Four women sitting round the table . The steaming plates , the white tablecloth , the ceremonial of the meal . On this side -- or perhaps on the other side too -- of the inevitable noises lay a dense , painful silence , the inquisitorial silence of the past observing us and the ironic silence of the future that awaits us . " <p> The strongest character in the book is Silvestre the cobbler . In later Saramago novels careful , honest workmen like him will appear , always significant , always wearing their significance lightly . Silvestre is married to Mariana , " so fat as to be comical , so kind as to make one weep " -- a thoroughly good marriage of calm-souled , generous people . The reactionaries who now control his country crushed Silvestre 's fierce social and political hopes , but not his spirit . He is a patient man , and his patience , his contentment , come across as far more than mere accommodation to defeat . <p> On the edge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lodger , Abel . He 's about the age of the author of the book , 31 or 32 , and it 's hard not to read him as to some degree a portrait of the artist as a young man . Purposefully avoiding close connection or commitment to anyone or anything , Abel appears a literary type of his time : the young man who holds himself aloof , guarded , perceptive , inherently superior , essentially joyless . Though he wins his arguments with Silvestre , Abel strikes me as being not as old -- nor as wise -- as he thinks he is . Are his existentialist poses a bit self-indulgent ? Silvestre earned his disillusionment the hard way , staking himself on committed radical action . Abel is n't going to waste his life on illusions . But where will his non-commitment take him ? Is he a realist reserving himself to act when action can succeed , or an idealist denying his own paralysis ? <p> In their last argument , Abel gets the last word , in fact the last words of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love has not yet arrived . " In the final silence after this statement , I sense an unspoken refutation or qualification , which is the fact of Silvestre 's life , a hard-working , responsible life built , in the most modest , limited , practical way , on love .

This puts pressure on their neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unprotected when their head is catapulted forward . This means that it 's vulnerable to the great force it 's being subjected to . <p> In a rear-facing car seat , your child is flung into the back of the seat and the force of impact is distributed along the whole back of the seat . Their neck , spine and internal organs are n't subjected to the stress of the force and are much more protected . <p> In a forward-facing seat your child 's neck is subjected to a force equivalent to 300kg-320kg , while in a rear-facing seat , the force on the neck is equivalent to 50kg . <p> Getting it right is vital for your baby 's safety , comfort and for your ease of use .

@@2663230 <p> A new law adopted by the Senate has ended months of uncertainty over reforms to France ? s simplified business set-up the auto-entrepreneur . <p> While some see the Pinel Law as a missed opportunity to clamp down on employment abuses , it has been greeted by auto-entrepreneurs as a modest victory after months of uncertainty . <p> Almost a million people have signed up to the scheme since its introduction under the Sarkozy government . For many expats it offers a straightforward way to test a business with a minimum of red tape and up-front costs . <p> The biggest advantage is that , unlike conventional business set-ups , social contributions are calculated according to turnover , with no minimum charge . Over half of all new start-ups are launched via the scheme , which involves maximum turnover levels before you have to change to one of the other conventional business models . <p> However , it has had its critics , not least established artisans who saw themselves as facing unfair competition from auto-entrepreneurs . Detractors also claim it has failed in its primary aim , to help small businesses to grow , with only around 5% of auto-entrepreneur startups developing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different status . <p> Another issue is the rise in ? concealed employment ? with some companies allegedly putting pressure on individuals to work as auto-entrepreneurs in order to avoid paying their social contributions . <p> In response , sweeping government reforms were outlined last year in a draft bill put forward by Sylvia Pinel , the then junior minister for trades . They included a proposal to limit the number of years auto-entrepreneurs could stay in the system and to cut the turnover threshold to just over half its current level . Both proposals were eventually rejected , and the new law , adopted by the Senate on June 5 is a tamer version of the bill . <p> Here we outline the main points : <p> Are the changes definitive ? Yes . The Loi Pinel is expected to come into effect on January 1 , 2015 . <p> How are existing firms affected ? Many elements , such as the limits on annual turnover ( ? 32,900 for trades and services , ? 82,200 for sales of goods ) stay the same . As before , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not hit these limits over a two year period ? in which case you must switch to a ? classic ? regime . <p> With regard to the tax Cotisation Fonci ? re des Entreprises ( CFE ) , which replaced the old taxe professionnelle , the Pinel Law confirms the 2014 Finance Law ? s abolition of the three-year exoneration auto-entrepreneurs previously enjoyed ( apart from for the set-up year ) . <p> Auto-entrepreneurs ? body the F ? d ? ration des Auto-Entrepreneurs says the latest rules mean the tax applies to all auto-entrepreneurs , which Evo ?

The Federation insists that CFE for auto-entrepreneurs should be at a percentage of turnover or else risks being punitively high for those earning small amounts . A working group on the issue meets this month . <p> Less controversially - a tax for frais de chambres consulaires ( towards running costs of the chambers of trade or of commerce ) will mean a slight rise in charges paid from January 2015 , of 0.044% of turnover for services , 0.015% for selling and 0.007% for artisans .. <p> All artisan auto-entrepreneurs will also be required to register at their chamber on the R ? pertoire des M ? tiers ( RM ) and those involved in selling will have to register with the equivalent Registre du Commerce et des Soci ? t ? s ( RCS ) . The requirement previously only applied to artisans , and only if the artisan work was their main activity . <p> Auto-entrepreneurs will be have to provide proof of professional insurance , in sectors where it is obligatory , notably the assurance d ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned on devis ( quotes ) and factures ( bills ) , as must artisans ? qualifications . <p> The law provides for an optional support scheme to help business owners once firms reach 50% of the turnover ceiling . Details of this are due later this year . It also provides for optional end-of-year social charge top-ups for those who have not worked enough to build up a full four quarters of pension rights . <p> I plan to become an auto-entrepreneur . What changes for me ? If you are an artisan , you will have to attend a four or five-day training course when you enroll , intended to help get your business off to the right start . As for other artisans , it will be compulsory and you will have to pay for it . <p> What about people registered under other small business set-ups ?

No . Some types of activities are not allowed , for example , lawyers , finance companies , hire companies and estate agents . People with revenue from royalties ( artists , writers , software designers etc. ) are also excluded . <p> What are the main pros and cons ? The auto-entrepreneur is relatively easy to set-up and run and it is compatible with a salaried job . <p> An important downside is that you will pay tax and charges on any expenses you invoice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you should look into classic business set-ups . <p> Business experts agree : choosing the right set-up is crucial <p> The Franco-British Chamber of Commerce held a conference in Paris recently on the auto-entrepreneur scheme , the first of a series of events aimed at small businesses and start-ups .

There are similarities in both achievements . <p> The German football team is strong because their national league promotes the development of indigenous talent rather than importing costly foreign players . The lower wholesale electricity price in Germany results from developing indigenous renewable power resources . <p> In contrast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive foreign-owned , nuclear power . The German football authority implemented its new youth development scheme in 2000 . That same year the German government introduced feed-in-tariffs to support the renewables . <p> In football , the power a player applies to the ball and the timing of the kick are crucial . If national electrical power demand is to be met then the timing of the power supply is vital . <p> The importance of teamwork was apparent to all who watched Germany win 7-1 against Brazil 's talented individuals . It is less well known that an experiment in Germany in 2006 demonstrated how wind power , solar photovoltaic ( PV ) power and biogas electricity generation could work together to satisfy the German electricity demand all year . <p> Indigenous resources lead to lower wholesale electricity prices . <p> Electricity costs more during the day when demand is high and expensive generators supply the extra electricity . In Germany , as in the UK , the daytime demand for electricity is highest around noon , summer and winter , when lunch is being prepared . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in both countries . As we will see , PV power output is highest at noon when the sun is highest in the sky . It is close to the peak in the daytime electricity demand . <p> In Germany in 2007 the wholesale cost of electricity was 30% higher at its maximum around noon than at night , as can be seen from Figure 1 ( above right ) . This difference has steadily declined as the amount of PV power connected to the grid has increased . <p> The fall is less is winter , as expected because the sun does not get so high in the sky at noon , but the wholesale price has been falling in winter too . Electricity from PV and wind costs less than from conventional generators when it is supplied . There are no fuel costs and only small operational costs . <p> This trend has continued . Thanks , primarily , to the renewable contributions , the yearly average wholesale price of electricity on the German grid declined from 2011 to 2013 . <p> It 's all about timing <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand for electricity in Germany can be seen from Figure 2 ( above right ) .

The operators of the German grid managed to keep all the lights on in Germany all week , whatever nature threw at them in terms of the yellow and olive contributions . <p> They managed to do so by adjusting the height of the grey area that represents the contribution of the conventional electricity generators . <p> The maximum of the yellow solar contribution is close to the peak in demand .

On Monday , Tuesday and Good Friday the solar contribution was low due to cloud cover , but the wind provided more power , as expected . Wednesday was a still , sunny day when wind power made its smallest contribution , but the solar contribution was high . <p> Weather forecasts can do a good job in predicting the amount of cloud cover and the strength of the winds so grid operators have a good idea what to expect . <p> Biogas electricity generators provide the ideal back-up to wind power and PV power .

Biogas supplied 17% of the power and only around 5% of electrical storage was necessary . <p> If the biogas comes from one of the many forms of waste there are three other advantages : the source is indigenous , the electricity is in general cheaper than from natural gas and has a far lower carbon footprint . <p> Biogas from waste often avoids the methane ( a far worse greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide ) emitte to the atmosphere were the waste left to rot . <p> Could the UK achieve these results ? <p> The UK 's onshore wind , PV and biogas from waste resources are similar to Germany 's .

The conservatives also plan to oppose onshore wind turbines in their 2015 election campaign . <p> The government announced in the Queen 's speech that it would be giving even more support to fracking natural gas . Given the uncertain yield , fracking is likely to give more expensive electricity than biogas . It will definitely have a far higher carbon footprint than biogas from waste . <p> The renewables are very popular with the electorate . The government 's own survey showed that public support for solar photovoltaic ( PV ) electricity stands at 85% and onshore wind at 70% , while fracking is only supported by 29% . <p> The simple truth - with lots of renewables , prices fall <p> The popularity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wholesale price of electricity in Germany is falling - and customers are the beneficiaries . <p> The public is most concerned about the retail price of electricity .

' We 're only arguing about 10 per cent . ' <p> The Hochhausers developed a unique relationship with Gosconcert , a branch of the Soviet cultural ministry .

It was there , watching the news on television , that Rostropovich learnt the Soviets had taken away his passport . He would not return to Russia for 16 years . ' And then they welcomed him back as a great Russian hero , ' Victor says , shaking his head . <p> It was their friendship with Rostropovich that led , in 1974 , to the Russians declaring the Hochhausers personae non gratae .

And of course they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next they cut off relations . ' <p> Stripped of their principal sources of business , they turned instead to China . They had already brought the Chinese Acrobats of Shanghai to Britain in 1973 , and in 1975 they took the London Festival Ballet to China -- the first appearance by a Western company since the Cultural Revolution . <p> It was not until 1991 , following perestroika that the Hochhausers were able to return to Russia . <p> And were they welcomed with open arms ? <p> Lilian laughs . ' No . Very diminuendo . We had to use the old charm again . ' <p> Ironically , their biggest star in the years they stopped doing business with the Russians was the man they had failed to present in 1961 . Following his defection , the name of Rudolf Nureyev , Victor says , ' could not be mentioned ' in Soviet circles . ' He was a traitor , ' and to have promoted him in Britain would have effectively ended their relationship with the Russians . <p> The moment the Soviets cancelled all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next 14 years they would work with him every year , presenting a gala of ballet , Nureyev and Friends , at the London Coliseum . <p> ' But not impossible , ' Victor interrupts .

But he never cancelled a single performance . And always sold out . ' <p> Who , then , I wonder , was the most difficult ? <p> ' Richter . ' Lilian says . <p> The Hochhausers first presented Richter in London in 1961 . The critic Neville Cardus dismissed his playing as ' provincial ' , but he would be more widely acknowledged as one of the greatest pianists of the 20th century . He was the first performer the Hochhausers booked after resuming business with the Russians in 1991 . <p> Victor nods . ' But when he played , ' he says , ' every ? thing was forgotten .

They hire the venues and pay the performers , and their expenses , out of their own pocket . <p> They are famously thrifty -- when Victor was awarded the CBE in 1994 one wag noted that it must stand for ' Ca n't Be Expensive ' , and they have been criticised for their high ticket prices . Their answer is always the same : they have never received a penny in subsidies ... and the best does not come cheap . <p> To bring the Mariinsky to London for the summer season costs in the region of ? 3 million . ' You 're talking about bringing 235 people , ' Victor says . ' The Bolshoi last year , 270 people . The hotels ... very expensive these days . The transportation . The visas . The fees , of course .

There have been countless concerts of popular classics ; Gracie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Vienna . <p> Critics of the Hochhausers say that their taste is too conservative , that they err on the side of familiar favourites . ' There are many things we 'd like to be a bit more innovative with , perhaps , ' Lilian admits . ' But it 's not within our remit . It comes back to the question of subsidy . You can be innovative if you 've got money to back it up . In ballet in particular people generally do n't like to be challenged with new things . We could put on the Mariinsky for three weeks performing just Swan Lake , and sell every ticket , but that would n't be right . This season is n't all absolutely sure-fire -- the Balanchines . But it 's interesting to do new things . ' <p> Nowadays the Royal Opera House season is their principal interest , although Lilian organises three or four other concerts a year for charity .

I did n't go hunting for one , but it might be the sort of vapid consumer psychology I sometimes adopt : if I ca n't do something but like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surely it would be big hugs all around if I got to drink my coffee from a cheery , huge-font mug . <p> Until recently I thought I was huggable , and very able to give good hugs too . But a couple of months ago I was in my mother 's kitchen and she was upset . I wanted to say that everything would be all right by putting my arms around her and letting her head rest on my shoulder . I could picture comforting her , but when I tried to jolt my body into action I found I was too self-conscious to actually go through with the hug . I said , " It 's all right , " instead , from a distance . I thought of my sister 's ease in the same situation . They have always been so tactile with each other and I wondered if I had once been like that , and , if so , when hugs began to feel awkward .

Perhaps this is not something that many parents and their adult children do , but the fact is , on that occasion I really wanted to . <p> I think of my own daughter , and how I behave with her . There are plenty of occasions when I 'd like to hug her , such as when she 's down . I dish out the usual meaningful but predictably dull advice . She 's a teenager and I understand how my concern -- whether physical or verbal -- can often be seen as highly irritating . But sometimes I know that she wants to be held , and I 'm the one who should be offering . The last time she was upset , I hugged her and her arms stayed by her side . But eventually her rigid body softened , and everything did feel decidedly better for a while afterwards . <p> Now that I 'm looking at all of this , I have to question why I mistakenly thought I found physical closeness in relationships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I started having sex , I knew I could meet a man and within a couple of hours be lying next to him totally naked .

I though that friendship had to be an immediate transaction : I 'll tell you something and you 'll help me , and then you tell me something and I can pay you back by helping you . <p> I did n't realise that the reciprocation could be delayed or that , in fact , sometimes the person who does the helping gains just as much as the person who is helped .

And this is useful , because I 'm beginning to understand that real intimacy demands an overcoming of fear and awkwardness ; it requires an increased level of trust and confidence . It 's arduous work indeed . <p> The male-on-male embrace is becoming increasingly common among politicians , and men in general . But for many it 's tricky to get right .

@@2671237 <h> Diana Vishneva and Vladimir Shklyarov , who take the lead roles in the Mariinsky 's first night of Romeo and Juliet , deliver captivating performances , says Mark Monahan <p> The Romeo and Juliet with which the Mariinsky Ballet launched its three-week residency at Covent Garden is essentially the first balletic version there ever was , the same one that opened in St Petersburg in 1940 , just two years after its first-draft premiere in Brno , Czechoslovakia . In that respect alone , given how many subsequent productions there have been , it is a fascinating spectacle . And yet , the question is inevitable : how does Leonid Lavrovsky 's compare to the one that for almost 50 years now been such a favourite with Covent Garden audiences , that of Kenneth Macmillan ? <p> It is , if one is honest , hard not to find fault with the Russian rendering . Its pas de deux have neither the subtlety , erotic charge nor reckless abandon of MacMillan 's , the fight scenes lack his venom , and the closing scene has an inappropriate dash of optimism . Pyotr William 's designs -- elegant as they are -- suffer by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monday night the Mariinsky 's orchestra took a primary-coloured and often hasty approach to Prokofiev 's masterpiece of a score that tended to favour the more abrasive passages . <p> Is that because there 's so much to cram in ? Quite possibly . Even with these frequently over-heated tempos , the Lavrovsky version is some 15 minutes longer than MacMillan 's , with less good-natured gadding about from Romeo , Mercutio and Benvolio in Act II , but a prolonged Act III bedside ensemble , longer soliloquies for Juliet and an entirely unfamiliar one for Romeo as he , exiled in Mantua , receives the fateful news of his wife 's supposed death . <p> So why was Monday night 's performance so stirring ? Simple : the dancing . In Diana Vishneva , there was the potentially irksome prospect of 38-year-old pretending to be 14 . And , although Vishneva 's jewel-like face appears magically unaffected by time 's passing , in her very first appearance with her nurse she nevertheless cut rather too noble a figure to be flitting around in quite so girlish a fashion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was stupendous . Blessed with a flawlessly classical line , physique and technique , and displaying a uniquely sculptural and lyrical approach to phrasing , this long-established star also has a spectacular jump and yet barely needs to leave the ground to give an impression of floating . In Act I , after a serene but appropriately measured encounter with Paris , her first meeting with Romeo led to her unleashing a stage-devouring but -- in time-honoured Mariinsky fashion -- entirely tasteful sequence of skips and jet ? s that took the breath away : seldom can rapture have looked more seraphically vivid or beautiful , and there was already a strong sense of a character with rich inner life . <p> Vishneva also rose to the many challenges of Act III , most memorably , though by no means only , in her reintroduction to Paris . Her Juliet 's resolve visibly stiffening by the second -- her body in Verona , but her heart and soul clearly in Mantua -- she played this duet like a pas de trois involving her , Paris and an invisible and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a subtly chilling one too . <p> She was also , in fellow principal Vladimir Shklyarov ( 10 years or so her junior ) , blessed with a sympathetic and supremely athletic Romeo , one with whom she also had instant and indelible chemistry .

However , Biden 's deputy counsel , Jessica R. Hertz , instructed the Air Force not to hand over the information to him , Kessler claims . <p> ' " They are covering up , " ' Kessler says an Air Force officer told him . ' " We spent a lot of time compiling the records , but Biden 's office said logs for each flight would have to be consulted . This is a smokescreen to delay providing any records as long as possible . " ' <p> Kessler called the vice president 's office 's actions ' unprecedented ' and contradictory to the president 's order that his administration should ' apply a presumption of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like President Nixon 's cover-ups , it is an effort to direct government officials to hide personal abuse , ' he writes in The First Family Detail . <p> Kessler says he eventually received the information he was seeking from the Air Force and found out that Biden 's trips to and from Delaware from the start of his first term as vice president through March of 2013 cost $979,680 . And that amount is only for the fuel and maintenance of Air Force Two . It does not include the cost of fuel for Marine Two or the salaries of the helicopters crew . <p> Over the same time period , Kessler says the Air Force told him Biden flew back and forth from Wilmington to D.C. 225 times . Those trips actually required a total of 400 flights , though , because of what Kessler calls ' deadhead ' trips - return flights when Biden was not on the plane . <p> The investigative journalist also found out that the total Air Force Two costs from Biden 's personal trips in fiscal year 2012 were $288,080 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andrews to play golf with Obama cost the aforementioned $12,406 . <p> Kessler 's assertion is backed by similar reporting from long-time White House reporter Keith Koffler last year . Koffler estimated on his White House Dossier blog that Biden 's weekend trips were running taxpayers $13,200 just for the Air Force Two flight costs . <p> In his report on Biden 's non-stop travel to Wilmington , Koffler also questions the need for Biden to visit his home there so often . <p> Noting that Biden has family in Delaware and is a regular at an exclusive golf course in the area , Koffler points out that ' in an era of soaring debt ' Biden was choosing ' to spend thousands of taxpayers dollars to accomodate a personal predilection . ' <p> ' Millions of American work in cities that they do n't call home , but few can afford the expense of returning to their ancestral grounds regularly , ' Koffler wrote . ' And none can rest their heads on pillows at the beautiful vice president 's mansion at the U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending is that the president a put him in charge of the administration 's Campaign to Cut waste in 2011 and claimed Biden would ' hunt down and eliminate misspent tax dollars in every agency and department across the federal government . ' <p> Biden then told supporters of the administration in an email that he was the ' new sheriff in town , ' Kessler noted . <p> In The First Family Detail author Ronald Kessler claims that Biden regularly travels to to Wilmington on Friday , returns to the D.C. area to play golf with President Barack Obama on Saturday , then flies back to Wilmington for the remainder of the weekend . The president and vice president are pictured here at the Fort Belvoir Golf Club on Father 's Day in 2009 <p> While Kessler and the Secret Service agent he spoke with characterized Biden 's gas guzzling golf trips with the president as occurring frequently , a report from The Hill last month said the vice president had not played together for nearly a year . <p> The last time Obama was known to have gotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 2013 , The Hill stated . <p> Furthermore , Biden has said multiple times throughout his vice presidency that he would prefer to take the cheaper , Amtrak train service between Wilmington and D.C. like he did when he was a Senator , but the Secret Service wo n't let him because it ' gives too many opportunities for people to interact with me in a way they would n't like to see . ' <p> It was only after last year 's budget cutting sequester that Biden was able to convince the Secret Service to allow him to take the train again . <p> ' I was able to say , " Look guys , I 've got to take the train now -- it 's cheaper than flying . " So I get to take the train again , ' Biden said at a National Association of Attorney 's General event in February of 2013 . <p> Still , Kessler says , the onus is on Biden for taking so many trips on the taxpayer 's dime knowing just how much they were costing . <p> ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way for Biden to make the trips , the question is why the sheriff who is supposed to cut out government waste thinks it is appropriate to take such frequent trips for personal reasons , ' Kessler writes in The First Family Detail . <p> Likewise , the Secret Service agents and Air Force officers assigned to Biden 's detail ' express outrage at what they consider an abuse , ' he said .

" It 's not uncommon for people to be killed on the river but more often it happens when they venture deep into the forest to collect firewood , crabs or honey . " <p> Joseph Vattakaven , of WWF-India , says : " The Sundarbans is a unique habitat that 's very harsh for tigers and people . These conditions leave the tigers very little prey -- mainly spotted deer and wild boar -- and more than anywhere else in the world they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many people have died in the hundreds of villages that lie scattered across the Sundarbans , a maze of swamp , islands and mangrove forests described by Amitav Ghosh , in his novel The Hungry Tide , as " the trailing threads of India 's fabric , the ragged fringe of her sari " . <p> Official estimates are sketchy and are generally thought to greatly underestimate the reality because so many of those killed simply go missing . Often the victims are there illegally and relatives fear a fine or the loss of their fishing permit . <p> An unsuccessful scheme to scare off the animals with masks <p> In recent years , tigers and humans have been increasingly thrown together , as climate change combines with years of forest subsistence to put resources under increasing pressure .

This makes them more vulnerable to tiger attacks , while the tigers are forced to come out of the forest because they are finding less prey . <p> Belinda Wright , a tiger conservationist and founder of the Wildlife Protection Society of India , who also lives in Bali village , says : " You ca n't walk through the forest . You have to crawl -- human beings become four-legged animals and so the tigers treat you like one of their prey . Over the years people have become completely dependent on the mangrove .

Whenever someone goes to fish or collect honey they stage an elaborate farewell because it might be their last trip . People pray for their safety . <p> " Everyone knows someone who has been killed by a tiger -- every village has lost at least one person . And on top of the deaths there are many that have been marked , bitten , scratched -- it is common for people to show their wounds .

The idea was that the tiger would attack , get an electric shock and associate that feeling with humans , making them less likely to strike again . <p> A male Bengal tiger is released deep in the forest after wandering too close to villages <p> " I 'm not sure that one worked , " says Mr Vattakaven .

But a more robust recovery than expected - and in particular a sharp drop in unemployment - now means a rate rise is on the cards for either late this year or early 2015 . <p> This would make it the world 's first major central bank to raise rates since the end of the financial crisis , despite Britain taking longer than most countries to return to its previous level of output . <p> Carney is unlikely to want to say much more on the exact timing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to emphasise his longer-term message that borrowing costs will increase gradually and peak at a level well below the pre-crisis norm . <p> " We expect some ambiguity about whether it is the fourth quarter or the first quarter next year .

@@2693233 The imperialist carve-up of Ukraine : where does the left and anti-war movement stand ? <p> The imperialist carve-up of Ukraine is leading to a stand-off between Russia and Western imperialism on a scale not seen since the Cold War writes Fred Leplat . But it has also exposed the deepest divisions within the left for a considerable period of time . Some of the lines of argument are reminiscent of those during the war following the break-up of the former Yugoslavia in the early 1990s. 1 <p> Most of the left does not describe Putin and his regime in Russia as being progressive . But there is reluctance to denounce , sometimes silence , and even support for Russia 's annexation of Crimea and intervention in Eastern Ukraine . The recently launched Ukraine Anti-Fascist Solidarity campaign2 only opposes UK , NATO and Western involvement but not Russian intervention in Eastern Ukraine . <p> This is in stark contrast to the Ukraine Socialist Solidarity campaign whose basic aims are " to support and build direct links with the independent socialists and the labour movement in Ukraine ; ( and ) to support the right of the Ukrainian people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the Western imperialism " . 3 <p> Left Unity and the Socialist Workers Party4 , have rightly opposed the attempt by Britain and the USA to seize the opportunity of the crisis in Ukraine to expand yet again NATO 's reach and ratchet up the threat of war . But they have also condemned Russia 's attempt to annex as much as possible of Ukraine . <p> Putin 's ambition <p> Left Unity stated5 in March : " Whether under the flag of US , NATO , Russia or the European Union , military intervention only ever makes the situation many times worse . So it is in Ukraine . The West 's hypocrisy in condemning Russia for breaking international law is breathtaking : nevertheless , Russian troops hold no solution to the crisis . " And concluded with the call for : " No foreign intervention in Ukraine -- whether political , economic or military ; Democracy and equality for all the people of Ukraine " . <p> Putin has been explicit in expressing his ambition to annex parts of Ukraine . Following the agreement on the 17 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the EU after the flight of former president Yanukovych , Putin declared that " Kharkov , Lugansk , Donetsk and Oddessa were not part of Ukraine under the Tsars . God only knows why they were transferred in 1920 " . Their transfer followed the defeat of the counter-revolutionary generals Denikin and Wrangel and the recognition of national rights for all Ukrainians by the new Soviet Union . Subsequently in 1954 , Khrushchev also transferred the Crimea to Ukraine . The annexation in March 2014 by Russia of the Crimea with its naval base in Sebastopol is part of Russian imperialist consolidation of its regional geo-strategic interests , just as is its backing for the murderous Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria which allows it a naval base in Tartus . <p> Imperialism has repeatedly attempted to intervene in mass movements to try to subvert them for its own objectives , whether it be in Europe or elsewhere . The popular mass movements for democracy in Hungary in 1956 and that of Prague in 1968 were supported by Revolutionary Marxists from the New Left and Trotskyist tradition . Communist Parties opposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support for the ruling Communist parties in those countries and the USSR 's " buffer zone " of states . <p> Maidan 's mass movement <p> The Maidan of late 2013 was a mass movement at the base of society , mobilising at times hundreds of thousands . It combined revolutionary aspirations of democracy and against the corruption of oligarchs and Yanukovych , reactionary features of nationalism as well as illusions that joining the EU would bring prosperity and democratic rights . Yanukovych had originally been tempted in 2013 by the EU 's financial bail-out of a bankrupt Ukraine , but was then brought back in-line by Putin with a better offer as the latter feared the loss Ukraine from Russia 's strategic " buffer zone " . His downfall was the result of the Maidan mass movement , not a Western organised " coup " . <p> In the absence of a strong left , the far right -- including the fascists of the Pravyi Sektor -- was able to steer the Maidan movement away from a progressive outcome . The election of Poroshenko as president confirms the balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nationalist , neo-liberal government which includes supporters of the far-right . There has been no mass movement on the scale of Maidan in Crimea and eastern Ukraine where the events have been described as a " gangster-police putsch , presented in ' people 's ' wrapping " . 6 <p> We have to take mass movements as they are , understand their contradictions and the forces involved , rather than dismiss them as being manipulated by imperialism if they do not fit into our schemas . Chris Nineham , a leading member of Counterfire and the Stop the War Coalition writes off the Maidan movement as having been " co-opted " and therefore that " denouncing all interventions equally and calling for support for the Ukrainian revolution , as some on the left are doing , is worse than meaningless " . 7 <p> Revolutionary Marxists can not be neutral in the current civil war in Ukraine . In the first instance , we should oppose our own government 's intervention and defend the sovereignty of Ukraine . But we also support the working class struggle for democracy , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Russian as well as Western imperialist intervention . Part of the crisis in Ukraine , is that of the unresolved national question left by Stalin and then the collapse of the Soviet Union . As the Fourth International recently put it : " In Ukraine , a left that leaves the national question to the nationalists will condemn itself to failure in advance . In the nationalist camp there are already currents emerging that are taking advantage of the marginality of the socialist left , and wish to appear in the eyes of workers as an alternative to capitalism " . 8 <p> The left and imperialism <p> The approach of Counterfire , along with the Communist Party of Britain and Socialist Action , 9 is that today the major threat of war comes from Western imperialism , in particular the USA as it is the major military and imperialist power in the world . Furthermore , NATO 's expansion eastwards in Europe and its military exercises are a dangerous escalation reminiscent of the eve of World War 1 in 1914 . Some believe that a " uni-polar " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multi-polar " world of rival states. 10 The conclusion of this approach is that while Putin 's regime is not nice , at least Russia and China are a counterweight to US hegemony . Therefore the only thing that matters today for socialists is to stop our own government 's drive to war and NATO expansion . <p> Criticisms of Russia and China are seen as a distraction as these countries are possible progressive allies of the left as they are not such dangerous war-mongers as the US and for some , capitalism has not been restored . This is a resurrection of a form of " campism " which infected parts of the left , in particular the Communist Party and the Labour left , during the existence of the Soviet Union . <p> While socialists should obviously in the first instance oppose their own imperialist government they should also oppose imperialism in general against attacks on working people and smaller nations and states across the globe . This means not just opposing NATO expansion and interventions , but also the annexation of Crimea by Russia and the carve-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Today , capitalism is a global intertwined and integrated system under US hegemony11 in a way which it was not in 1914 . The two world wars of the 20th century were mainly wars of inter-imperialist rivalry to gain or maintain control of areas of the world . The outcome of these wars was the establishment of the USA by far and away as the major power in the world , ruling the capitalist system through its massive economic and even greater military power , and through institutions such as the World Bank , the IMF and NATO . This global capitalist system has further expanded with the restoration of capitalism in Russia and China , but this does not mean that inter-imperialist rivalries and the threat of regional wars are no longer on the agenda . <p> Regional interests <p> The form of US hegemony in operation today means that weaker states are allowed to pursue their own imperialist ambitions and regional geo-strategic interests , including through military interventions conditional on them at least not challenging the main thrust of US interests ; something which is delicate to achieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain extent be at the expense of US imperialism . If they step out of line , they become " rogue " states that have to be subdued militarily as in the case of Iraq , or sanctions imposed such as for Iran and now Russia . To maintain weaker states within the framework of US imperialism , the latter has to carry out a lot of sabre-rattling . This is a dangerous game , as any incident such as the accidental downing of MH17 in Ukraine , or of the Iran Air plane by the US navy in 1988 killing 269 people , can rapidly escalate into a full military confrontation , the dynamics of which may no longer be in the hands of US imperialism and its allies . But sabre-rattling should not be confused with a dynamic towards inter-imperialist war like that leading to the two world wars . This is not the nature of the period today . <p> As long as Russia remains within its regional geo-strategic sphere , Western imperialism ( i.e. the USA and NATO ) is not greatly concerned by Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced are so far symbolic -- mainly against individuals -- and there are deep divisions on extending them because of arms and gas deals , and because of the globalisation of the capitalist system . Sanctions that hurt Russian capitalism also affect Western capitalism . <p> This explains why US imperialism is not worried about Russia backing Bashar al-Assad in Syria with a continuous supply of arms . There is a coincidence of interests between both countries as neither wants Bashar al-Assad to fall . The collapse of his regime would revive the stalled " Arab spring " , threatening not just Russia 's naval base in Tartus , but also the US attempt to rebuild its credibility in the region and possibly overturning Syria 's " peaceful co-existence " with Israel . <p> Co-operation between the USA and Russia goes back to the fall of the wall in 1989 . Gorbachev then did not object to the re-unification of Germany and its integration within NATO in an implicit exchange for foreign investments and a lowering of the cost of the arms race . The co-operation goes back even further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet Union under Stalin and US imperialism . Then revolutionary movements were held back and subordinated to the needs of the Soviet Union 's foreign policy . The " building of socialism in one country " meant an accommodation with imperialism . <p> Putin is no Castro <p> This view of a global integrated capitalist system under US imperialist hegemony , albeit with a hierarchy of imperialist states , is at odds with those socialists who see US imperialism as the main danger and other imperialist states as lesser evils and who therefore believe that we have entered a period " of global conflict that is leading the world towards the violent chaos we witnessed one hundred years ago " . 12 <p> Unfortunately , there are no mass socialist revolutionary upheavals such as those of Russia , China , Cuba or Vietnam which required massive military intervention to crush them . Neo-liberal austerity is being rolled out across the world with little resistance , destroying many of the gains of the working class and introducing new relations of production . <p> Those who see US imperialism as the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and some even allow themselves to be used by pro-Russian nationalists . They believe these nationalists when they proclaim their support for the working class against Western imperialism and their fight against the " Nazi " regime in Kiev imposed by a coup . <p> John Pilger , a respected investigative journalist , writes that " What is certain is that Barack Obama 's rapacious , reckless coup in Ukraine has ignited a civil war and Vladimir Putin is being lured into a trap " and that " Moscow 's inevitable response ( to Washington 's putsch ) in Russian Crimea ( is ) to protect its Black Sea fleet " . 13Once you believe that there has been a coup and not a mass movement , albeit with a strong nationalist and neo-liberal character , then you can believe anything including Russia 's right to annex Crimea . <p> Pilger writes in a later article14 that " the leaders of these obstructive nations are usually violently shoved aside , such as the democrats Muhammad Mossedeq in Iran , Arbenz in Guatemala and Salvador Allende in Chile , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Congo . All are subjected to a western media campaign of vilification -- think Fidel Castro , Hugo Ch ? vez , now Vladimir Putin " . Comparing Putin to Chavez and Castro stretches political credulity . <p> But Pilger goes further when he carries on in the same article that " having masterminded the coup in February against the democratically elected government in Kiev , Washington 's planned seizure of Russia 's historic , legitimate warm-water naval base in Crimea failed . The Russians defended themselves , as they have done against every threat and invasion from the west for almost a century " . To believe that Washington had planned to seize Russia 's naval base in Crimea makes us wonder whether Pilger has lost all his senses . <p> But it gets even more incredible when he writes further in the same article that " for the Germans , it is a poignant irony that Putin is the only leader to condemn the rise of fascism in 21st-century Europe " . Evidence abounds that Putin works with the far right and fascists in Russia and across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Front National in France was welcomed in the Duma and met the Speaker of the Duma and Deputy Prime-Minister. 15 Pravda openly acknowledges Russia 's support for the fascists in the European Parliament 16 . Nazis are allowed to march in Moscow alongside Stalinists on the 1st May . 17 <p> Such an article by Pilger flies in the face of facts , supports Russian imperialist annexation and paints Putin as an anti-fascist . Such rubbish should be condemned and it is extraordinary that it was posted on the Stop the War Coalition website without comment . <p> " If we have to pick a side ... " <p> Unfortunately , Pilger is not the only socialist supporting Russia . Eamonn McCann wrote earlier in the year " if we have to pick a side over Crimea , let it be Russia " because " in this instance Russia has more right on its side than the West " . 18 Socialist Action views the events in Ukraine as a struggle between Russia and imperialism19 , obviously implying that Russia is not imperialist . John Pilger 's nationalist references to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view that " German monopoly capital is clearly preparing for economic expansion into Ukraine " . 20 Socialist Appeal and Workers Power are also covering up Putin 's imperialist land grab by cheering on the struggle against Kiev-based fascism . <p> What is worrying is that Russian nationalists and reactionaries are working with some on the left in Russia and elsewhere to cover-up what is the Russian imperialist grab of parts of Ukraine . The latest event was an " international conference " entitled " The World Crisis and the Confrontation in Ukraine " held in Yalta , Crimea ( formerly part of Ukraine , now annexed by Russia ) on July 6-7 . The aim of the conference included the creation " an international network of support for the movement for the creation of Novorossiya " . 21 . The conference was organised by Boris Kargalistky , a Russian socialist , and with some Russian far right or fascist currents .

It is also an error to invite Boris Kargalitsky to address the NATO counter-summit in Cardiff at the end of the August . <p> The divisions over Ukraine , and over Syria , have grave implications for the anti-war movement .

His downfall was the result of the Maidan mass movement , not a Western organised " coup " . <p> In the absence of a strong left , the far right -- including the fascists of the Pravyi Sektor -- was able to steer the Maidan movement away from a progressive outcome .

Can you say who burned thoase proples to death , Fred ? Unlike the LO you will not be banned if you blame the Maidan fascists for it . And such faith in US Imperialism , not for a moment would they consider grabbing Russia 's base in Crimea . And the votes taken , why are those not even mentioned . I must say it is sad to see you falling for the US/UK/EU propaganda like this .

Merging policy on the welfare state , TTIP , trident , Scotland . <p> Working class gains are ebbing away fast , and with TTIP that can only continue , so workers in Britain voting Labour remains the main obstacle to socialism in Britain . <p> Breaking the working class from the Labour party should be the priority to four international in Britain . <p> Socialists should not be placing equal signs between Putin and the legitimate struggle of the people of eastern Ukraine to defend their language and social rights from the far-right , pro-imperialist regime in Kiev . Too many British comrades endorse or remain silent on the claim that the eastern movement is just an extension of the Kremlin . Here 's some analysis that does n't do this : http : **32;1126;TOOLONG <p> The complication is that there is no one movement in Eastern Ukraine . There 's a reason why the principal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principal opposition , the Donetsk People 's Republic : because that republic and its militia are Russian-staffed and funded . Of course no-one says they are simply an extension of the Kremlin , any more than pro-Soviet Afghan government was . But it 's simply mistaken to say that the language rights of Russian-speakers are threatened , or that the conflict is a struggle over neo-liberalism . If it were primarily that , why would Putin be supporting it ? <p> ' In this extraordinary context , critics are opening up two crucial debates : first , is BRICS anti-imperialist as advertised , or potentially inter-imperialist as the Ukraine battleground portends , or merely sub-imperialist where it counts most : in the ongoing global financial and climate meltdowns ? ' <p> I would like to see discussion on the question of whether Russia is imperialist as opposed eg to sub-imperialist . <p> Simply asserting that the Maidan had " mass support " can be used to justify almost anything , particularly if you do n't examine its social composition , political motivations and the international support it was receiving . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A class analysis of the Maidan shows it was nothing nothing like the Hungarian Uprising in 1956 , or " Solidarity " in Poland ( prior to Martial law ) -- both of which were dominated by organized workers . But these were notably absent from the " Maidan " , which was essentially " Orange Revolution , Mk II " . <p> 60% of the protestors were middle class ; professionals , entrepreneurs , and managers . ( Kyiv International Institute of Sociology ) <p> While opposition to repression and the resignation of Yanukovych were its most popular demands , the political objective was to secure the signing of the EU Association agreement with the EU . This was supported by 71% of the protestors questioned . <p> Achieving this objective required the transformation of the Maidan Camp into the Maidan " Sich " -- a term with allusions to a traditional Cossack Military camp . It also alludes to the " Sich " riflemen , which fought against the Red Army in 1918 and in which many influential right wing Ukrainian nationalists served . No amount of participation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a silk purse . <p> Nor is it true that the Maidan ever had majority support throughout the country . Polls conducted in February indicated it was supported by 40% of the population as a whole , but only 8% in the East . Only in the Western Ukraine was there majority support ( 80% ) <p> A disproportionate number of protestors in Kiev and casualties in the " Heavenly Hundred " came from Lviv , Ivano Frankivsk and small towns in Western Ukraine which are strongholds of Svoboda . In recognition of this , " Svoboda " received several cabinet positions in the new government . Kerry , Ashton , Nuland and Hague all rushed to Kiev to support this government and secure their political objective -- the Association Agreement . <p> It remains to be seen exactly how Putin will jump , but the Kremlin was far more decisive about securing its military bases in Crimea , than it has been about defending the civilian population of the Donbass . <p> Kagarlitsky 's position ; that the Kremlin would ultimately betray the autonomists in the Donbass still retains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move left under the pressure of events . <p> His latest article throws a bucket of cold-water over the much of the drivel written ( invented ? ) by Guardian hacks and the people on the left who follow their every word.http : //links.org.au/node/4008 Funnily enough , I 've never seen Kagarlitsky being interviewed on RT !

He awoke from his lovely Kubla Khan reverie , he informed her in a subsequent billet-doux , to be confronted by " stern realities in the shape of Kitchener and Winston " . <p> For Asquith , the Great War was an unpleasant interruption to playing golf and " spooning " with Venetia , 26 years his junior . Having thrown the nation into the maw of global conflict , the Liberal government was decidedly lukewarm about fighting it . <p> " Squiffy " Asquith made just one good call in between the tippling and the spooning and it was enough to prevent catastrophe . He appointed Field Marshal Horatio Herbert Kitchener , 1st Earl Kitchener , as Secretary of State for War .

He had ended the war in South Africa by covering the veldt in concrete and barbed wire . <p> Kitchener was the national mascot , the imperial warhorse . On the announcement of Kitchener 's appointment on August 5 , 1914 , the newspapers hailed him as " the popular choice " and heartily congratulated the government . <p> When Kitchener sat down for his first Cabinet meeting , the others around the table were aghast ; the Field Marshal announced that he intended to base his calculations on a war lasting three years , that sea power alone would not determine the outcome and that Britain needed a mass army . <p> Like Churchill , Kitchener would have preferred conscription to raise the mass army but the Liberals were deeply averse to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that every freeborn Briton had the right to eschew military service . <p> Kitchener 's bright idea , which was satisfactory to politicians and military men alike , was a mass army of citizen volunteers . Something certainly had to be done ; the German army marching through Belgium had 2,200,000 men bearing arms , while the British Expeditionary Force rounded up to fight it was 80,000 strong . In the words of official war historian Sir James Edmonds , the British Expeditionary Force was " incomparably the best trained , best organised and best equipped forth to war " . But it was tiny . Even General Sir Henry Wilson , director of military operations , called it " our funny little army " . <p> On August 6 Parliament approved the raising of a " New Army " of 500,000 volunteers , aged between 19 and 30 , for " three years or the duration of the war ; whichever the longer " . <p> Contrary to received wisdom , the men of Britain did not then rush to the recruiting office , stand on tiptoe and puff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men had jobs or obligations too important to be simply dumped .

After all , the British royal family , aka the Saxe-Coburg-Gothas , were about as British as frankfurters . <p> The figures on recruiting tell a fascinating tale . Initially enlistment was modest , with just 8,193 men , mostly from London , volunteering between August 4 and August 8 . To raise the enlistment rate , men had to be induced into volunteering . And quickly . For a man whose greeting to journalists was " out of my way , you drunken swabs ! " , Kitchener was a surprisingly savvy PR manipulator .

This is odd . Sculptures are often characterised by their weight and their rigidity . Not so here . This one looks rigid -- but it is not . Perhaps , in the course of time , it will evanesce or melt away . What is more , because of the way its base seems to taper , it looks slightly raised up off the lawn as it leans , perhaps with even a hint of tragedy .

He sources images from the web , and then refashions them on screen , transforming them into geometrised versions of the original image . He drags the image away from its origins until it is transformed into something part-remembered , part-forgotten , part-imagined . Once he is satisfied with this newly conjured virtual presence , maquettes are made , in three dimensions , and from there , the sculpture itself . So nothing begins out in the world . <p> Why should we value them though ? We value them for the challenge that Ziegler is throwing down to his forebears . Starting back to front as he does , he is admitting into sculptural practice a lightness of being , a strange sideways shift of fabrication , elements of play , teasing and transience , which also challenge us to think about how we remember objects , and what in fact we remember of them when we think we remember them very well . There are few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own best cherished images of that which we think we know so well . So much looking is to do with our own conjuring . Every time one of Ziegler 's pieces shivers in the wind , its appearance -- and therefore its character as an object -- changes slightly .

Few think or talk better than American political commentator Charles Krauthammer . If you do n't already do so , be sure to adopt the habit of reading Krauthammer 's columns and watching his videos , most easily available at National Review Online . <p> Krauthammer makes most British commentators seem juvenile . His learning and clarity of thought lead to insight and brevity of expression . <p> Here he is , for example , destroying Obama 's naivety over the Ukraine : <p> " Obama says Putin is on the wrong side of history , and Secretary of State John Kerry says Putin 's is " really 19th-century behavior in the 21st century . " This must mean that seeking national power , territory , dominion -- the driving impulse of nations since Thucydides -- is obsolete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human nature that transformed the international arena from a Hobbesian struggle for power into a gentleman 's club where violations of territorial integrity just do n't happen . " <p> He is an informer rather than a performer . Not for Krauthammer the " more radical or compassionate than thou " posturing of the Guardianista hereditary caste of pundits . He takes the trouble to understand historical and political challenges and as a consequence speaks because he has something to say , not because he has a column to file . <p> Consider this article on the Gaza crisis . Krauthammer does not condescend to the Palestinians by treating them as a homogenous bloc . He describes the various factions and ambitions within the Palestinian and wider Arab world and elucidates the power play by Hamas against its rivals . <p> He explains why moderate Arab opinion is against Hamas , and highlights how useful idiots in the West have been played like a fiddle in the interests of Arab extremism . <p> Though empathetic to the challenges faced by the Israeli leadership and mindful of the interests of moderate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American interest . That is how it should be . <p> Such nuance and understanding is almost absent from mainstream British media commentary on the Middle East , with a few honourable exceptions such as Roger Boyes and Mark Urban . <p> Global responsibilities bring a global perspective . Krauthammer achieves a moral seriousness in part because he is informing the political class of a hyperpower -- a class that can bend global events to its will . <p> Krauthammer 's early adulthood was spent as a Democrat . A graduate of Harvard Medical School , he began his political career writing for the left-wing New Republic and speech writing for Walter Mondale . Now he is perhaps the centre-right 's most accomplished commentator . <p> It is tempting to argue that , like many of the best conservative writers , Krauthammer moved from left to right as he got to know more about how the world works . <p> But Krauthammer says the Democrats left him , and not vice versa . He was a great admirer of Senator Henry ' Scoop ' Jackson , a Democrat Cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Soviet Union . As time passed Krauthammer saw that such clarity of vision was losing ground among the Democrats and so the sagacious and the silly parted company . <p> Krauthammer first attracted wide attention as a realist in the 1980s when he coined the term the " Reagan Doctrine " , under which strategy the US did not merely " contain " the USSR but instead sought to test and weary the Communist Empire through proxy mini wars . <p> It worked . <p> Krauthammer also first articulated the concept of a post-Cold War " Unipolar Moment " ; a few decades of US hegemony where the US could shape events substantially by acting unilaterally . Whether the US uses such power wisely ( or at all , in Obama 's case ) is of course a matter for the elected politicians . <p> It would be wrong to see Krauthammer as a party man .

In all likelihood , he rarely has to " think on his feet " because he has been through the various scenarios a dozen times before the interviewer even knew there was an issue . <p> His manner -- " Here are the facts : take them or stay ignorant " -- is a glorious contrast to the stuttering , victim crouch of the likes of , say , Britain 's Tessa Jowell ( and a hundred others ) , who punctuates each sentence with a dozen " errrms " and " hmmms " as she gropes towards the party line and safety and vacuity . <p> Why are we stuck with third-raters while the US has pillars of wisdom like Krauthammer ? <p> Do n't worry about it .

" brigade have been out in force , incredulous that less enlightened souls should be surprised by such news in 2014 . <p> But people have every right to be shocked . <p> For Frank Maloney was not a bohemian artist known for his tapestries and ceramic vases , he was a Millwall-supporting " geezer " from Peckham who fought and won ferocious battles at every level of the hardest , most destructive game , from small hall amateur boxing to the glitziest prize fights in Las Vegas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frozen out of the heavyweight division by Lewis and Maloney , called the little man in the Union Jack suit a ' mental midget ' .

So if some people giggled , that is entirely understandable , because it was all so far-fetched and discombobulating . <p> And while the majority of the reaction on social media consisted of regurgitated jokes and mickey-taking , there was almost no revulsion or anger . This suggests that although we have a long way to go , we are heading in the right direction . <p> There was also plenty of support from high-profile boxing figures , including Lewis and another of his old fighters , Julius Francis . Indeed , so effusive has the support been that some - including Maloney - have registered their surprise that such a ' macho world ' was capable of such understanding . <p> But the phrase " the macho world of boxing " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Maloney 's announcement , is more than a little bit condescending .

The only rule most boxing clubs have is that you respect the rules and respect each other , whether you 're black , white or whatever . With the emphasis on " whatever " . <p> Boxing has a long , although not always glorious , tradition of racial integration .

The film is based on the novels by Kyril Bonfiglioli , specifically 1999 's The Great Mortdecai Moustache Mystery . It sees Mortdecai traversing the globe in an effort to recover a stolen painting rumoured to contain the code to a lost bank account filled with Nazi gold . <p> The trailer shows a luxuriously moustached Depp travelling to Los Angeles , described as " a terribly vulgar place " and taking part in traditional aristocratic pastimes such as shooting peasants ( no typo ) .

In a strange way , her dancing with them is maybe a modicum ' better ' than Taylor tunnelling out from underneath these legs and looking up with this smirk , like ' Is n't this wacky ?

@@2733231 <h> Symphony guide : Tchaikovsky 's Sixth ( ' Pathetique ' ) <p> Forget , first of all , its mis-translated moniker . Tchaikovsky 's final symphony might be about death , but it 's the piece he termed ' the best thing I have composed ' and is a confident and supremely energetic work <p> Portrait of Tchaikovsky ( 1840-1893 ) - his Sixth Symphony changed at a stroke what a symphony could be . <p> Let 's get this clear : Tchaikovsky 's Path ? tique Symphony is not a musical suicide note , it 's not a piece written by a composer who was dying , it 's not the product of a musician who was terminally depressed about either his compositional powers or his personal life , and it 's not the work of a man who could go no further , musically speaking . It should n't even be called the Path ? tique , strictly speaking , with its associations of a particularly aestheticised kind of melancholy . Tchaikovsky himself , having supposedly approved his brother 's Russian word ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ( " Patetitceskaja " ) for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in English ) , and having decided against calling the piece " A Programme Symphony " , sent his publisher the instructions that it was simply his Sixth Symphony in B Minor , dedicated to his nephew Bob Davydov . That 's how the piece appeared when Tchaikovsky himself conducted the premiere in St Petersburg on 28 October 1893 . It was only in its first posthumous performance , three weeks later , that it was called the " Path ? tique " , a moniker that has stuck ever since . <p> Instead , the Sixth Symphony is a vindication of Tchaikovsky 's powers as a composer . It is the piece that he described many times in letters as " the best thing I ever composed or shall compose " , a work whose existence proved to him that he had found a way out of a symphonic impasse , which represented a return to the heights of his achievement as a composer -- away from what he thought of as the numbing , written-by-numbers populism of his ballet The Nutcracker or the trivial " pancakes " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- and brought a deep , personal satisfaction that he had n't felt in years . Having recently sent the score of the Sixth Symphony to his publisher , his brother remembered " I had not seen him so bright for a long time past " . <p> And yet the Sixth Symphony is about death . It 's the fulfilment and tranfiguration of a programme that Tchaikovsky had sketched for a Symphony in E Flat Major that he discarded in 1892 ( whose first movement he reworked as his Third Piano Concerto ) . " The ultimate essence ... of the symphony is Life . First part -- all impulse , passion , confidence , thirst for activity . Must be short ( the finale death -- result of collapse ) . Second part love : third disappointments ; fourth ends dying away ( also short ) . " While that is n't a precise description of what became the Sixth Symphony , in the broadest sense of a symphony whose final image is of musical , emotional , and physical collapse -- as it is in the Sixth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection . It 's also the closest we have to a revelation of the programme behind the Sixth Symphony , which Tchaikovsky told his beloved nephew Bob was there in the music , but which would remain a secret . <p> But frankly , there 's no need for the divulging of anything more programmatically specific . That this is a piece about a struggle between the life-force and an inevitable descent to an exhausted physical and emotional demise is obvious to anyone who has heard it and lived through it . This symphony finally faces the fate that stalks Tchaikovsky 's Fourth and Fifth symphonies ( the motto themes of both symphonies stand for the destiny of their symphonic heroes ) but which their frenetic , bombastic concluding movements attempt to dodge . In the Sixth , Tchaikovsky meets that inexorable descent head-on , and in so doing he creates a new shape for the symphony , in one of the most audacious and boldest compositional moves of the 19th century . That slow , lamenting finale turns the entire symphonic paradigm on its head , and changes at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : instead of ending in grand public joy , the Sixth Symphony closes with private , intimate , personal pain . <p> Which might have some saying : Exactly ! That 's why this symphony is a reflection of Tchaikovsky 's autobiography ! He must have been depressed/suicidal/about to become the victim of an anti-homosexual secret court ( one of the more recent and most ludicrous theories behind Tchaikovsky 's death on 5 November 1893 , nine days after he had premiered the Sixth Symphony ) to have composed this ! And there 's more : the Russian Orthodox Requiem chant even makes a blatant appearance in one of the most dramatic coups-de-th ? ? tre in the first movement ! You see ? He knew he was dying ! <p> To which the only possible rejoinder is : I 'm afraid that 's nonsense . To take some examples from elsewhere in musical history : many of Rachmaninov 's pieces are haunted by the Dies Irae plainchant , that symbolic intonation of impending fate , and yet even after writing a piece called The Isle of the Dead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of intimations of mortality , but he kept going for decades after dreaming of his own execution in his Fantastic Symphony ; Beethoven did n't expire after just after he faced the limits of human mortality in the Missa Solemnis ; and even Mahler remained alive just after he had just crossed the border into silence at the end of his Ninth Symphony . In fact , if every composer , author , painter , or poet had died after making their greatest works about death , none of them would have been around for very long . It is pure , tragic coincidence that Tchaikovsky should die of cholera a few days after conducting the Sixth Symphony at the age of just 53 -- a piece , to reiterate , that he actually composed in good mental and physical health -- but that 's all it is . We do this symphony a terrible injustice if we only see and hear it through the murky prism of myth , story , and half-truth that now swirls around accounts of what happened in the composer 's final days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between a stubborn life-energy and an ultimately stronger force of oblivion that ends up in a terrifying exhaustion , but what makes the piece so powerful is that it 's about all of us , not just Tchaikovsky . And that 's because of how Tchaikovsky makes the musical and symphonic drama of the piece work . So when you 're listening to the performances below , hear instead how the cry of pain that is the climax of the first movement is a musical premonition of the inexorably descending scales of the last movement , and how the second movement makes its five-in-a-bar dance simultaneously sound like a crippled waltz and a memory of a genuinely sensual joy . Listen to how the March of the third movement creates a seething superficial motion that does n't actually go anywhere , musically speaking , and whose final bars create one of the greatest , most thrilling , but most empty of victories in musical history , at the end of which audiences often clap helplessly , thinking they have arrived at the conventionally noisy end of a symphonic journey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the real finale , that Adagio lamentoso , which begins with a composite melody that is shattered among the whole string section ( no single instrumental group plays the tune you actually hear , an amazing , pre-modernist idea ) , and which ends with those low , tolling heartbeats in the double-basses that at last expire into silence . <p> That silence was its own kind of victory for Tchaikovsky . He knew this piece marked a new high-watermark in his confidence as a composer , and that he had re-invented the symphony on his own terms , and for so many composers who came after him . Mahler , Shostakovich , Sibelius , and many others could not have composed the symphonies they did without the example of Tchaikovsky 's Sixth . It 's just a terrible fluke of fate that this was his last symphony , and not the beginning of what could have been his most exciting creative period as a composer . <p> Paul Kletzki/Philharmonia Orchestra : apologies for the sentimentality , since it 's hard to get hold of now , but this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I grew up with , and which still defines the piece for me -- it might for you , too .

@@2733233 <p> Will Pooley was working as a nurse on the Kenema Ebola unit in Sierra Leone , one of the two main clinics in the country working with patients before he contracted the virus . Jo Dunlop , a freelance journalist , met him on several times as she reported on the crisis . <p> It was a brutal week at Kenema hospital when I met Will six weeks ago . The slowly diminishing nursing staff were reeling in the wake of the death of their respected colleague and friend , Sister Mbalu Fonnie , who became infected with the virus after treating patients on the Ebola ward . Her death closely followed that of seven other nurses who worked on the ward . A few days later , the much-loved Dr Sheik Umar Khan , Sierra Leone 's only haemorrhagic fever specialist , would also test positive with the disease . <p> Will finished his shift late the night we met .

They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were forced to make the painful decision to leave the 45 Ebola patients unattended as no one had turned up for the night shift . They both needed a break to gather their strength so they could do it all again the next day . Will was rattled by the dilemma of having to leave the patients alone . " We gave them water and paracetamol and then we had to walk out . Patients are dying the most horrible deaths , I 'm expecting to find several corpses tomorrow morning . " <p> Will spoke of the traumatic situations he was confronting each day on the ward . His accounts were unadorned and honest , and he explained some of the practical struggles of dealing with so much death when you have such limited resources . He described patients dying in front of him and then being unable to find help to shift their bodies , which meant leaving bodies lying next to other patients . <p> He talked about everyday life at the heart of the Ebola outbreak . There were people up , walking and recovering , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughter . He described women in recovery , saying : " They were sitting around singing songs , you would n't see that on a ward in England , you would n't see people singing like that . " <p> Will , who arrived quietly without the backing of an international organisation , spoke of his determination to perform a role that so many simply refused . " I know it 's the easiest situation in the world to make a difference , in nursing terms I 'm not particularly experienced , or skilled , but in this situation I can really make a difference and make things a lot less bad . " <p> I continued to check in with Will through text messages and a few phone calls . I was worried for his safety and I wanted him to know that he had not been forgotten . He always remained buoyant despite the overwhelming challenges he no doubt faced . There were rumours of the Red Cross turning up to provide more staff and logistical support from M ? decins sans Fronti ? res ( MSF ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week later .

Staff training and a restructuring of the unit were improving conditions in the hospital for both patients and health workers . Will assured me : " It 's a lot safer , it 's a lot cleaner environment for the patients and the staff . " <p> Will described how patients who receive a negative test result after recovering from Ebola are showered , given a fresh set of clothes , a certificate declaring they are Ebola-free and a small amount of money for the ride home . Relatives usually gather to meet them and there are emotional outpourings of thanks to the hospital staff and God . It 's a beautiful moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into an otherwise dark situation . " It 's great , it 's great , seeing them walk away after some of them have been in a terrible state and seeing them on the wards and thinking they 're probably going to die .

" <p> Will was flanked by a group of upbeat young women who had all been discharged and were keen to take a photograph before they said goodbye . He was clearly popular among the patients and he was fond of them . " They were all together on this one ward , " he said pointing to the women , " It will be so quiet in there now . " <p> It was not only the patients who held Nurse William in high esteem but his colleagues as well . Yoko , the tough Sierra Leonean nurse , spent a lot of time on the ward alongside Will .

Photograph : Guardian <p> The last time I saw Will he told me : " At the start , especially , I could feel the weight of the horror that is the inside of the Ebola ward but you quickly get used to it . I do n't go on to the ward each morning with that same dread of the corpses and blood that I did to start with . It has become a bit routine now . " <p> The issue of personal safety and that of his colleagues was a concern for Will . But the possibility of becoming infected just did not seem like an option for him . He assured me at one point that " the PPE that we wear protects you against Ebola , full stop really . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistakes and everything is done properly then you will never catch Ebola when you are working . " <p> He also said that he did not take the same risks that his colleagues had taken . " I operate very differently to local nurses .

So I 'm protected by circumstance in some ways and also I 'm a lot more afraid than the local nurses so I take more precautions . " <p> When the small and close community in Freetown heard of Will 's positive test result on Saturday it was a devastating blow and cruel reminder of what we all know -- those most at risk of catching Ebola are health workers . <p> Many , like Yoko at the Ebola unit , were shattered by the news but hopeful for the treatment he will receive .

Not so in France , where the purging of hard-Left ministers by Fran ? ois Hollande has fuelled the CAC 40 .

He is hardly likely to be as radical as he should be . France needs an economic revolution , undoing not just Hollande 's original set of policies but also tackling the legacy of decades of economic blunders ; rearranging the deckchairs to buy time and slow the exodus of capital and talent is not a sustainable solution . <p> The idea , which Hollande still holds , that the eurozone 's problems are being caused by an excessive focus on reducing budget deficits is a nonsense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too tight and most economies are in dire need of a radical supply-side revolutions . <p> The other problem is that the French far-Left will now become even more vocal , led by former ministers who no longer have anything to lose .

It is hard to see any of this changing any time soon , despite Macron 's arrival .

By the end of July , there were 1,245 Syrian refugees in Brazil , displacing Colombians as the largest refugee community . Brazil has nearly 6,600 refugees , of whom 1,169 are Colombian . But it lacks a comprehensive policy to assist them , as Uruguay is trying to put together . Brazil recently signed an agreement with the UNHCR to ensure refugees have access to public services such as healthcare and education , and job opportunities .

Not so this time around . <p> Each have a newly installed manager who lately made 10 changes for a domestic fixture and suffered defeat at a much smaller club . Neither have any place in the Champions League and -- even at this mewling stage of the infant season -- both have fans calling for the board to quit . Mind you , there are differences , too . <p> United can spend the equivalent of 80 per cent of Celtic 's annual turnover on a single player , but Celtic will have European football until Christmas at the earliest . Nevertheless , it is a singular non-achievement not to make the Champions League group stage after two bites at the cherry and to fail to win four consecutive qualifiers in as many weeks . <p> And who would argue that Ronny Deila and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ League group stage had they been forced , like Legia Warsaw , to make a hazardous trip to Kazakhstan such as they survived by the odd goal in five last year ?

The chief executive is practised in these circumstances , so there will be no revelations and no revolutionary pledges . <p> Deila will stay and be given time to assemble his squad and impose his vision . The cracked business model of Scottish football will be invoked as will the virtues of financial prudence . <p> And -- since Lawwell rarely misses a chance to post a little message about relative fortunes -- the Celtic support might be reminded of the fact that , although it ended in frustration and failure , their team spent Tuesday evening contesting a place in the most alluring of all club competitions while the erstwhile rivals from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Queen 's Park at Airdrie . <p> Nevertheless , the question posed by the dissenters among the Hoops support is , how could achievements have plunged from the high of beating Barcelona in the Champions League in November 2012 to the nadir of being dumped from the same tournament by a dreadfully defended goal by Marcos Tavares for a Maribor team whose home gates last season averaged 3,000 ? <p> Lawwell can assert that the difference in resources between Maribor and Celtic is paralleled by the financial gulf between Celtic and Barca and that such upsets happen in football . <p> All the same , the decline in effectiveness in a squad which reached the last 16 of the Champions League 18 months ago -- by which time Chelsea and Manchester City had departed the tournament -- was flagged in last season 's group stage , when Celtic finished bottom of their section with only one win to show for six outings . <p> Fraser Forster , Gary Hooper , Kelvin Wilson and Victor Wanyama have gone for substantial sums , with only Virgil van Dijk representing similar quality for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the same drop in standard would have been permitted had Rangers still been viable contenders for the Scottish title and therefore also Scotland 's place in the Champions league qualifiers . <p> Deila has to take some responsibility for the qualifying debacles . Against Legia in Warsaw he persisted with open play while a man down and he set Celtic up for a sucker punch at home to Maribor with both the nature and timing of his substitutions . <p> To be fair , had Deila ordered Celtic to hold on to their away-goal advantage on Tuesday he would have prompted derision from the crowd without any certainty that the defence would have held out . It can also be stated that it took Neil Lennon two seasons to make inroads in Europe -- and he was also aided by a walkover victory in a lost tie when Sion fielded ineligible players . <p> Deila , though , does not have the alternative of a competitive domestic league to occupy his players or the fans . He must decide swiftly if Efe Ambrose , Kris Commons , Leigh Griffiths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans . <p> He needs to identify a goalscorer for the Europa League and a means of cementing his back line .

There was a clear topic of conversation -- the future of Sam Burgess , the Slammin ' Sam star of Australian rugby league , who is bound for Bath in mid-October with an eye on breaking through in time for the 2015 Rugby World Cup . <p> Ford initially regarded the muscle-packed , hard-hitting , 6ft 5in and 18st league forward as a perfect fit for a union No 8 . England saw him as an inside centre . Where once there was seemingly a difference , now there is agreement . Burgess will be schooled as a centre . <p> Did England put Bath under pressure , even though the owner of the West Country club , Bruce Craig , is footing the reported ? 270,000 transfer fee from South Sydney Rabbitohs for the three-year deal ? <p> " No , not at all , " Ford said . " We will decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him and he is our player . I still think long-term Sam will make a fantastic No 8 . That is my gut feeling . <p> " But if he has got any chance of playing for England at the World Cup , it is going to be at inside centre . He has got to learn the game . That is easier to do from No 12 . He can see the field , not worry about line-out issues or scrum laws . Clubs get a rugby league player and try to turn them into a rugby union player . They sign him for his qualities and then try to change him . <p> " We wo n't do that . It does n't make sense . Sam did what he does again in midweek for South Sydney -- 31 tackles , 28 carries , two tries .

Burgess is a force , a rallying point , a warrior and a leader in league . That is what England want , Bath , too . <p> Burgess , 25 , was lured to Australia in 2010 by Russell Crowe , the Hollywood actor who co-owns the Rabbitohs . " Rugby league in Australia is special , " Ford said . " They have the mindset that they are better than us . So when you go there to play , you are not as confident .

' " <p> Burgess is a mature figure , a perspective shaped by the trauma of nursing his father , Mark , through the terminal illness that claimed his life at the age of 45 . During his four years in Sydney he has met every challenge head on . <p> One player at Bath knows him better than any , the man whose No 12 shirt he will be gunning for at club and country , Kyle Eastmond . <p> " He is a friend of mine and I 've known him since I was 12 , first played against him for Lancashire Under-14s against Yorkshire , been in every national training camp all the way through , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was always a standout player .

" <p> Another Bath player , fly-half George Ford , is also acquainted with Burgess . " Sam was at Bradford Bulls and I was making the decision whether to go to Bradford or Leicester , aged 16 , and he came to the house with England and Bradford coach Steve McNamara and basically said : ' Sign for Bradford , we 've got a young team , it 's going places .

@@2742235 <h> Top 10 Players In Desperate Need Of A Deadline Day Transfer <p> With the transfer window due to close this coming Monday evening , Pies thought we 'd turn our beady eye to those players ( mostly Premier League-based ) going slightly stale around the edges at their current clubs who really need to be agitating for deadline day moves before having to hold their peace again for another six fallow months . <p> Without further ado , let 's get going ... <p> 10 . Javier Hernandez ( Man Utd ) <p> Down at the bottom of the sub 's bench , among the Powells and the Keanes , there mopes a tiny sad-eyed striker , he be the littlest Pea . <p> Chicharito looks well and truly fed up with his lot at United , with his managers evidently unwilling to trust him as a first-choice striker due to his lack of defensive gumption . <p> In the grandest tradition of out-and-out strikers , all Chicha wants to do is loiter on the edge of the six-yard box all game and steer the ball across the line with whichever part his anatomy suits . <p> Sadly , that does n't seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lone forwards expected to muck in and defend from the front -- which just is n't in Hernandez 's DNA . <p> He 's a nailed-on 20-goal-a-season poacher if deployed on his terms , but he 's never going to get that kind of leeway at United it would appear . <p> 9 . Loic Remy ( QPR ) <p> His definitely has his foibles , but Remy is a proven Premier League goalscorer -- which , once indelibly marked on one 's CV , goes an extraordinarily long way these days . Just ask Steven Fletcher . <p> We 're frankly astounded that Remy began the season back at QPR , with it all going decidedly quiet on the potential suitor front since Liverpool pulled out of an ? 8.5million move over concerns a long-standing issue with the French striker 's heart back at the end of June . <p> Remy could definitely do a job ( even if it is just on an auxiliary basis ) for any top-half side -- a top-half side like , say , Arsenal . <p> 8 . Micah Richards ( Man City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has played under 800 minutes of Premier League football since May of 2012 . <p> That 's roughly eight-and-a-half games ' worth of league football in the last two-and-a-bit years . Amazing . <p> You ca n't blame City for keeping him on because of his agreeably beneficial nationality and home-grown status , but you 'd like to think that Richards ' maintains a sliver of professional pride which is crying out for first-team action . <p> Eh , maybe he 's perfectly happy where he is ? It 's his career to do with as he pleases . <p> 7 . Daniel Agger ( Liverpool ) <p> A classy , fully-developed , ball-playing defender who is routinely courted by Barcelona , it seems strange that Agger is almost the archetypal Rodger 's centre-back but still ca n't seem to dislodge the happy-go-lucky Mamadou Sakho in the Liverpool manager 's affections . <p> With Dejan Lovren 's ? 20million arrival over the summer forcing the Dane down another rung on the pecking order , it seems that the writing is on the wall for him as far as his Liverpool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reds fans would be heartbroken to see the man with " YNWA " tattooed across his knuckles walk out the door with his bindle slung over his shoulder . <p> Who knows , maybe the myriad injury niggles are starting to conspire against him ? <p> 6 . Tom Cleverley ( Man Utd ) <p> Much-maligned as the embodiment of United 's flaccid central midfield , Cleverley has suffered the slings and arrows of outrageous banter for not proving to be a like-for-like replacement for Paul Scholes as originally billed . <p> Indeed , we can only imagine that being told how shite you are and how flawless your predecessor was on a daily basis ( at both club and international level , we might add ) may have affected Cleverley 's confidence over the past couple of years , with a fresh start at a less demanding and more moderate club definitely the way to go for the 25-year-old . <p> With Aston Villa and Valencia both reported to have had ? 8million bids accepted this afternoon , it looks like Louis van Gaal feels the same . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for one moment do we think Ben Arfa is an entirely innocent party in his ongoing exile at Newcastle , but it 's plainly clear that the French winger is never going to play for the club again as long as Alan Pardew and his cronies are in charge . <p> Unreliable , delicate , petulant , aneurysm-inducingly inconsistent and also capable of match-winning scintillas of jaw-dropping genius in equal measure ; such is the innate conundrum of the luxury flair player -- though , with Remy Cabella now poised to take up that mantle at St James ' , there 's a danger that Ben Arfa will be forgotten about entirely if he does n't unclench his fists and move on . <p> 4 . Lukas Podolski ( Arsenal ) <p> Arsene Wenger claims he has no intention of letting Podolski go before the window shuts on Monday evening despite the German forward 's bit-part status at Arsenal being further compounded by the marquee acquisition of Alexis Sanchez . <p> No doubt a decent hand to have knocking around as back-up , Podolski 's work rate , application and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wenger sees him as anything other than a useful sub to have on hand given he spends more time on the Emirates bench than anywhere else . <p> He 's better than that , surely . <p> 3 . Danny Welbeck ( Man Utd ) <p> The fact that Welbeck is a local-boy-done-good has endeared him to the United faithful since he broke into the first-team picture as a teenager in 2008 but the club are in dire need of a top-to-bottom , multi-million pound renovation and , when it comes down to brass tacks , the 23-year-old Longsight lad just ai n't quite on the level ... not yet , at least . <p> With Angel Di Maria already coming in as a super stellar signing to bolster United 's forward stable , Welbeck 's 2013/14 career prospects at Old Trafford have already been exponentially weakened . <p> With the England national side suffering an unprecedented dearth of quality strikers , Welbeck needs to be playing regularly in his favoured position for someone -- and you feel that is n't going to be his beloved boyhood club . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a summer appraisal would be the best option ? <p> 2 . Radamel Falcao ( Monaco ) <p> We do n't for one iota imagine that Falcao regrets agreeing to his ? 350,000-a-week , tax-free move to Monaco , but it saddens both us and a great deal of others to think that one -- if not the -- best striker in world football is wiling away his days in front of nobody in a European ' B ' league week after week . <p> Rumours are that Real Madrid ( and possibly Arsenal ) are haggling over a ? 20million deal that will see the Colombian move to the Bernabeu on loan for just one season . <p> Obnoxiously extortionate ? Yes , undoubtedly so -- but this is the abstract , irrelevant world of professional football so who cares ? <p> 1 . Fernando Torres ( Chelsea ) <p> If the whispers on the wind are to be believed , it appears that the negotiation of a compensation pay-off with Chelsea is all that stands between Torres and a much-needed move away from these shores . <p> AC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to flee Chelsea , that transfer fee , the Premier League and its guffawing hordes at least a year later than he really should have done . <p> We 'll never see Torres operating at the level he peaked at during his mercurial middle years at Liverpool , but we choose to believe that there 's still a salvageable striker in there somewhere . <p> Agree/disagree ? Any other names you want to throw into the hat ? Let 's have it ... <p> I would love Richards , Hernandez , Podolski and Agger at Saints . Wages would be a problem though , not to mention the fact that they probably would n't want to come . Then again Cambiasso has gone to Leicester so who knows what the f is going on on planet football .

@@2746237 <h> Hegemony Rome : The Rise of Caesar PC review <p> Here is my dilemma with Hegemony Rome : The Rise of Caesar : it 's boring as hell ; but it 's also irresistible . <p> What do you make of a game that seems to exist in a state of quantum superposition , both dull and exciting , mediocre and brilliant ? Why is one of the best games ever made about the Roman Empire also one of the least sexy ? <p> The Romans define Empire for most westerners . Hell , every successive European empire could not help embracing some of its trappings . They either overtly claimed the mantle of Rome , as the Holy Roman Empire did , or they clad themselves in Neo-Classicism meant to evoke their illustrious predecessors . Napoleon even gave his regiments imperial eagles . <p> Against all of this weight of history and popular memory , Roman rule can feel a little inevitable . Gladiator gave voice to this in its opening scene , as two Roman generals watch a German tribe emerge from the forest and scream a challenge to the assembled Roman legions . <p> Hegemony Rome : The Rise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is not about serried ranks of crimson-cloaked legionaries and the weaponized Stoics leading them . It 's not about the roar of the crowd at the arena , or the Machiavellian maneuverings of geriatric senators trying to rule the world without being changed by it . <p> It 's about the details of Roman conquest . It 's about battles won because one side still had food and the other did n't , about how infrastructure pumps the blood of an empire but also saps it of vitality . It 's about having too many enemies and too few friends , and never enough money or manpower to deal with both . And it 's about the sheer absurdity of waging war across hundreds of miles with armies that can only move at the speed of foot , where the distance between two fronts can be a nearly a season 's march . <p> Victory is far from inevitable . It requires a lot of planning and patience . Maybe too much . <h> Where 's my abacus ? <p> Hegemony is a very slow game . Things can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real-time strategy game where you 'll have only seconds to react when an enemy army appears on your flank and begins moving to strike . But that flank attack might be happening all the way down in Toulouse while the nearest reinforcing army is wrapping up a campaign outside Antwerp . In that case , you have to get your troops moving on a 15-minute real-time walk to the new battlefield . Hope you brought a book . <p> And yet Hegemony keeps you busy with details , even when nothing seems to be happening . You must constantly make the rounds of your holdings , ensuring that your conquered cities are still enjoying Pax Romana , that all your lumber camps and gold mines are fully staffed by workers or ( far more likely ) slaves . Are your armies up to full-strength ? Who needs to be shifted off the front , and are your native auxiliaries loyal enough to Rome to stand and die for it against their ethnic kin ? <p> This workload is never-ending , and it just gets larger as your empire expands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Except , like a lot of the strangely compelling sim games , Hegemony 's fascination with process and detail ends up being deeply satisfying . You construct new supply lines and depots to keep your armies well-fed and motivated as they go to war . You shut down old forts and supply lines that no longer serve a purpose . You slowly shift your armies into position , trying to guess how many troops you 'll need for the job . After all , there 's always an unquiet frontier that needs some more soldiers policing it . Your cavalry rides into the enemy countryside , scouting for cities , armies , and paths of attack . Finally , when the forward supply depots are fully stocked and you invasion force is assembled , you march . <p> Then a bunch of Germans come and attack your somewhere else while your back is turned and you have to do it all over again , in the other direction . <p> Screw this game . It 's awesome . <h> The forest for the trees <p> This is all taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life has conditioned us to lose sight of what distances actually meant in the pre-industrial world , but Hegemony Rome makes you realize just how much territory there is between Spain and Germany , and how difficult it is to control when you can only move at the speed of march . You can be zoomed all the way in on an Aquitanian battlefield , watching lines of infantry drawn up for a clash while cavalry skirmish on the flanks , and then you pull back the camera . <p> The units become tiny and resolve into counters . The battlefield vanishes into a parchment map of the entire province , with cities and supply lines criss-crossing it . Then you scroll back farther and the province shrinks to the size of a fingertip , and you are seeing the map of France from the Channel to the Alps , from the Pyrenees into Germany . What you can see with your line of sight is nothing but tiny pockets of illumination . The rest of the map is darkened , unknown territory . <p> Somehow , by fighting battles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those provinces and those supply lines , you are supposed to conquer all that territory . You 've been playing for 10 hours and you 've hardly begun . <p> That often leaves me feeling like I 'm sitting down to a banquet . The road to conquest stretches out before me , full of knotty supply problems , proud armies in-waiting , do-or-die battles on distant frontiers . <p> But then I think about how much of this game is really whack-a-mole . How the AI rarely seems to mount a coordinated campaign against you , but instead forces constant policing and the re-taking of old ground . How the core problems rarely ever change , just increase in size and amount of work they take to solve . Instead of supplying one legion you 're trying to stockpile enough food for 12 of them . Instead of pacifying one Gallic city , you 've got to tamp down resistance in eight of them . Thank God you can pause the game , or the workload would be completely unmanageable . <p> The campaign even exacerbates these problems because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get attacked every ten minutes by the same group of Belgians , but you ca n't cross the magic line to go put a stop to their shit once and for all . Instead , you just deal with the constant harassment . <p> Yet there is also something brilliant about this . So much of Roman foreign policy was really just yelling , " Ow ! Quit it , " again and again until finally some Romans lost their tempers and exterminated an entire tribe . <h> Divide and conquer <p> But you ca n't do it all at once . This is something else that contributes to Hegemony 's slow pace . Something that comes through in Caesar 's commentaries is the fact that the Gauls never understood , until it was far too late , just who it was they were dealing with . They viewed the Romans as yet another tribe , a strong one that could be manipulated and exploited to settle internecine conflicts . <p> Diplomacy in Hegemony is not as nuanced as it could be , but there 's an elegant simplicity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy peace and allies . But gold is not a storable resource . It is a current . Every new army and every new peace treaty diverts some of the stream and reduces the amount of cashflow you have available . So you have to think about what peace treaty will the most valuable , headache-curing one , which tribes are better off guarded but ignored , and which ones you need to conquer immediately . <p> Get it right and slowly , piece by piece , Gaul will fall under your sway . Get it wrong and your frontiers will collapse as your overstretched armies get crushed by an onslaught of enemies , and you 'll have to fall back to a safe position . Then , after licking your wounds , you 'll have to rebuild . <p> I 'm not sure you could ever prise the good things in Hegemony apart from the bad . A better AI with a finer grasp of the game 's objectives might help , but it might also be beside the point . Hegemony is about making the player the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who ca n't think beyond the next river , or the next valley . <p> More importantly , all this slow , grinding detail is what makes Hegemony such a brilliant treatment of Roman warfare . There may not be another game that has understood the subject so well , and that makes it well worth exploring . You want to be a great Roman general ? Then count your food , count your money , and count your enemies . If you 've done the math right , then you 've already won before the battle is even fought . <p> Still , I wish I did n't feel like I was on autopilot for so much of the time , or that the correct strategy was so one-size-fits-all . When Fraser and I talked about the game on Three Moves Ahead , I was much more forgiving of it , but after 25 hours , my admiration for its treatment of Roman warfare is starting to fade into impatience with the rote processes it imposes on me . Hell , that mission the forces you to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of level design . <p> There is much to be said for Hegemony Rome , and sometimes simple problems do become more interesting if taken to a larger scale . But a truly great strategy game should never be this repetitive , even if the Romans did like their conquests nice and methodically predictable ..

@@2757240 <h> 1 ) Roberto Baggio ( Fiorentina to Juventus , 1990 ) <p> There have , of course , been plenty of controversial transfers down the years . It 's inevitable that with such free movement of players , every now and then the odd one moves between rival clubs and causes a bit of a stramash on the terraces . After all , football fans will boo pretty much anyone and anything , as those who heard Arsenal fans pour derision on Gonzalo Higua ? n for having the temerity to sign for someone else last summer will testify . When you 're getting it in the neck for making a basic career choice that does n't really have much serious impact on anyone 's daily life , you know you 're in something of a rum business . Still , under normal circumstances even the most controversial transfer merely causes some light frothing and heavy swearing from the assembled masses , and unless things get too unpleasant we can all soak up the boos and invoke the famous old " sticks and stones " maxim . <p> Not in the case of Roberto Baggio 's transfer from Fiorentina to Juventus , mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , pretty fond of their golden boy , bought as a kid from Vicenza and nurtured into one of the brightest young talents in Italy . This was partly because he was a brilliant young player , but also partly because the club helped usher him back to fitness following a career-threatening knee injury , suffered just days before his move from Vicenza was confirmed . He was one of their own , but by the time the 1990 World Cup loomed into view the big dogs of Serie A had taken notice , and being the dog with the loudest bark in Italy Juventus simply had to have Baggio , offering a world-record fee of 16bn lire ( around ? 8m ) to snare their man , who said he felt " compelled " to accept the transfer . This was n't just a smaller club 's best player being sold to a bigger club , of course , because while most people in Italy disliked Juventus in the way that people generally do n't like the biggest clubs in any one country , Fiorentina fans despised them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stemming from a rather spicy title race back in 1982 . <p> The Scudetto was desperately close , and on the last day of the season the two clubs were level on points , Fiorentina travelling to Cagliari and Juventus facing Catanzaro . As has often been the case with Juve , refereeing decisions turned out to be key in the afternoon 's events , with Fiorentina 's Francesco Graziani having a goal questionably ruled out on their way to a frustrating 0-0 draw . Meanwhile Juventus were awarded a late penalty which Liam Brady slotted away in his final game for the club , earning them their 20th league title . While on this occasion there was little serious suggestion that there was something truly askew , Fiorentina fans did n't exactly take the whole thing in their stride , convinced that some sort of skullduggery had taken place . " They have stolen our championship , " said the captain Giancarlo Antognoni afterwards , a sentiment common with the club 's fans who adopted the slogan " it 's better to be second than be thieves " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move on , Turin was n't exactly their favoured destination . The animosity had been further fuelled by that year 's Uefa Cup final against , would you credit it , Juventus , in a tie again decided in the Old Lady 's favour thanks to refereeing decisions that were ... debatable . When Baggio 's transfer was finally confirmed shortly afterwards , the frustration spilled over into outright violence , with fans rioting on the streets and laying siege to the Fiorentina headquarters for three days . In the end 50 people were injured , but Baggio 's move went through and the resentment merely grew . <p> As a postscript to the story , when the two teams faced each other the following season Baggio refused to take a penalty , ostensibly on the grounds that the Fiorentina goalkeeper , Gianmatteo Mareggini , knew his game so well that he could predict where the kick would go . He did n't help matters with his new supporters when he was substituted later in the game , and picked up and kissed the badge of a Fiorentina scarf that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling right , " Baggio later said of the incident . " Suppose I miss the penalty kick ? People would say I do it on purpose . Often I allow team-mates to take my penalties so they can have goals , but no one talks of that . The Italian press blew this out of proportion . I picked up a scarf , and they bust my chops . " NM <h> 2 ) Bryn Jones ( Wolves to Arsenal , 1938 ) <p> Usually when people discuss transfers that cause something of a commotion , the unrest and unpopularity is located among the people , the paying spectator who allows tribalism and woofing partisanship to get in the way of logic and good sense . There are few things more impotent yet cathartically satisfying than laying into a man we have never met and probably will never meet with the sort of verbal barrage that would make a docker blush , all for some perceived slight that has offended our terribly delicate footballing sensibilities . Of course it 's ludicrous , but when did being a football supporter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game does not often extend to the lofty and morally pure halls of the Houses of Commons , mind . As we know , politicians usually only concern themselves with sport when there 's a photo opportunity to take advantage of , a zeitgeist to grab on to , or when there 's something to be outraged about . In 1938 , the latter opportunity presented itself , when Arsenal paid the whopping sum of ? 14,500 for Wolves forward Bryn Jones , breaking the British transfer record . This caused a hand-wringing debate in Parliament over the question of whether it was right and proper . It was not long after the depression , and with war looming , it seemed wrong for that much money to be spent on something as frivolous and vulgar as a footballer . One wonders what the paroxysms of outrage would have been like had the transfer of Bernab ? Ferreyra , the Argentinean forward for whom River Plate paid Tigre a stonking ? 23,000 six years earlier ( holding the world transfer record for some 20 years ) , happened in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objection seems to have been raised in the corridors of power when Arsenal broke the record 10 years earlier , since on that occasion they nearly doubled it to bring David Jack to Highbury . <p> And this was all before Jones revealed himself to be one of the bigger wastes of money in the history of wastes of money . Purchased by Arsenal to replace the great Alex James , who had retired a year earlier , it all started pretty well for the Welshman after he scored on his debut , but from that point on he tanked . His career would be interrupted by injury and the war , but he would score just seven times in 71 appearances , his modest personality and preference to withdraw himself from the limelight blamed for his failure to adequately replace James . If there is one thing that the transfer of Jones has taught us though , it is that there is nothing new under the sun , not least people complaining about the amount of money in football . NM <h> 3 ) Harry Kewell ( Liverpool to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more financially ruined than Ol ' Gil from the Simpsons , but the years in which Leeds United " lived the dream " produced memories that will last for years . Whether that compensates their fans for the administration , drudgery and humiliation that would follow is a point of debate , but part of the joy of that late ' 90s team was that it was young and vital , a side comprised not just of big money buys but also players genuinely loved by the fans , from those brought through the youth team such as Gary Kelly and Alan Smith , to " the Chief " Lucas Radebe . Among that number was Harry Kewell , who had joined Leeds from his native Australia aged 15 , and who rose through the ranks to be one of the most sought-after players in the top flight . <p> So when the financial house came tumbling down and Leeds had to sell off anything that was n't nailed down ( and a few things that were ) , Kewell should probably have been one of the first and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his value decreasing , until Liverpool arrived with a bid in the summer of 2003 . Even then Kewell hardly helped his club , allegedly threatening to allow his contract to run down and leave for free the following summer unless Leeds agreed to a deal in his favour . All of which meant Leeds , scrabbling around for all the money they could get , received only ? 3m for a player valued at ? 40m three years earlier . Kewell 's agent Bernie Mandic breezily justified this by claiming his client " could have pocketed the entire ? 5m or whatever the figure would have been at other clubs " had he left on a Bosman . Kewell later displayed an Olympic-standard lack of self-awareness by claiming he " left on good terms " , something that would either cause mirth or spitting ire when his name came up in that particular corner of West Yorkshire . It 's therefore probably fair to say that plenty of bridges had been burned at Elland Road by that point , and short of removing the head from the Billy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty creative for his relationship with Leeds to get worse . <p> As it turned out , Kewell got very creative a few years later when his contract at Liverpool expired and he had his pick of clubs to join . In a move that could be best described as spicy , Kewell chose Galatasaray as his new employers , an interesting choice given that two Leeds fans , Christopher Loftus and Kevin Speight , had been stabbed and killed in Istanbul before a Champions League game between the two sides in 2000 . " When I decided to join Galatasaray , obviously there were a few Leeds fans who were disappointed , " Kewell shrewdly observed in 2010 , displaying a flair for the understatement to rival that produced by his left foot in his Elland Road heyday . <p> Kewell claimed his intention was to try to bring the two clubs closer together , choosing 19 as his squad number " out of respect " , because that 's the one he wore in his early days at Leeds . " I felt that it might be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all started and I was hoping that , in a small way , it would help the healing process of the tragedy , " he claimed in an open letter to Leeds fans after joining Galatasaray .

NM <h> 4 ) Alfie Conn ( Tottenham Hotspur to Celtic , 1977 ) <p> The relationship between Rangers and Celtic fans was not always toxic . Why , back in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , players used to move between the clubs with little ado . And there were occasions when the rival clubs ' supporters would happily band together for joint-pursuits , such as when they combined to attack the police following the news that extra-time would not be played in the tied 1909 Scottish Cup final replay . But gradually , with sporting , economic , social and political changes , co-operation became less common and poison seeped into much of their interaction with each other . Alfie Conn found this out long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post-War player to cross the Glasgow divide and , even if his switch did not provoke as much bile as Johnston 's would more than 20 years later , it came as an enormous shock . Conn had been a Rangers hero , a member of the victorious 1972 European Cup Winners ' Cup team and a scorer in the Ibrox side 's win over Celtic in the following year 's Scottish Cup final . He was a swashbuckling , long-haired winger with sideburns that recognised no master and he was loved by the Rangers faithful . He was admired by Tottenham Hotspur , too , so they lured him to London . After three seasons there , rumours began circulating that he was set to rejoin Rangers . Their fans were excited . Then he signed for Celtic . <p> " What 's it all about Alfie ? " bawled newspaper headlines at the time , because printing the chorus of any other Cilla Black track would have been bizarre . Celtic fans were overjoyed , Rangers fans appalled . Conn explained that his eagerness to work under Jock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ besides , Rangers had not bid for him . " When Stein asked me , I did n't hesitate , " he said years later . " Several people warned me against it but it was only after I signed when I flew back to Glasgow , with all the press and TV , that I realised it was bigger than I first thought . That 's when it hit home . It was n't easy hearing the team that used to cheer for me throwing insults but at least it kept the city talking . " <p> Conn 's career at Celtic was hampered by injuries and loss of form , though the winger did not believe that those reasons were enough to explain why Billy McNeill , who replaced Stein as manager in 1978 , never picked him for an Old Firm match . Stein had not always picked him either , but Conn said he was puzzled by his non-selection under McNeill . " I always seemed to get dropped for that game , " he said in 2006 .

But the important thing to note is that the transfer left a lot of people peeved and many folks still argue about it now . In 1949 Di St ? fano was on the books of River Plate in his native Argentina but when a player 's strike was called , he , like others , went to a breakaway Colombian league that was beyond the realm of Fifa and so its clubs did not have to pay transfer fees -- but did pay players big bucks . Di St ? fano won three league titles in four years with Los Millionarios until Colombia rejoined Fifa and the rogue league had to fall into line . Di St ? fano suddenly wound up without a club and incurred heavy losses from the sudden sale of his property in Bogota . But he still starred for Los Millionarios in their final European tour , producing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That aroused the interest both of Real and Barcelona . <p> Real agreed a fee with Los Millionarios . Bar ? a agreed one with River Plate ( who still held his official registration ) . Everyone agreed it was a proper pickle . So the Spanish Football Federation stepped in and decided that Real and Bar ? a should share the player , with Di St ? fano playing a season for Real , then one for Bar ? a , and so on . There was such an outcry from Barcelona members that the club 's president was forced to resign for accepting the decision . Their mood was not gladdened when , four days after the decision , Di St ? fano turned out for Real and scored a hat-trick -- against Bar ? a . Later that season Bar ? a tore up their claim on the player , who thus stayed at Real for another 11 seasons , during which he delivered performances that ensured he is still remembered as one of the greatest players of all time . Quite what convinced the Catalans to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with many Barcelona fans decrying the influence of General Franco , though Sid Lowe shows in his book , Fear and Loathing in La Liga , that Bar ? a dithering played a big role too . PD <h> 6 ) John Robertson ( Nottingham Forest to Derby 1983 ) <p> Brian Clough loved John Robertson , the left winger who shone during Nottingham Forest 's golden years -- memorably scoring the only goal in the 1980 European Cup final -- and he was hailed by his manager as " the Picasso of our game " . Peter Taylor admired him too , and three was company because Clough and Taylor were a happy couple , having shared in each other 's success at Derby County before they paired up again at Forest . In 1982 Taylor retired from football . Six months later he was persuaded to work again , back at Derby . And when he then sought to sign Robertson behind Clough 's back , Ol ' Big Head blew .

@@2771230 <p> Cameron , in setting out the government 's plans to impose further immigration controls , wrote that " while most new jobs used to go to foreign workers , in the past year more than three quarters have gone to British workers . " <p> He said the Office of National Statistics ( ONS ) figures from which Cameron 's claim was drawn related to net changes in employment , not " new jobs " . He pointed out that the chair of the UK Statistics Authority ( UKSA ) had previously stated publicly that it was inaccurate to describe net change in employment as " new jobs " . <p> It was wrong for two reasons . First , the net change in the number of people in employment is not the same as the numbers who move into employment ; it is the difference in the flows of people into and out of employment . <p> Second , the number of people in employment , and the number of jobs in the economy , were not the same thing : an individual may have more than one job , or share a job . <p> The UKSA chair had confirmed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of new jobs ( or the proportion of those that were filled by UK nationals ) based on the ONS figures . <p> Portes also noted an analysis of statistics by the London School of Economics ' Centre of Economic Performance ( CEP ) , which found that immigrants had never accounted for the majority of all new jobs generated in the UK . <p> According to the PCC ruling , the Telegraph initially defended Cameron 's claim on the grounds that the public would understand an increase in employment as " jobs " . <p> The ONS figures showed that between 1997 and 2010 , 53% of the rise in employment was accounted for by foreign nationals . Over the last four years , in contrast , nearly 70% of the rise in employment had been accounted for by UK nationals , rising to 76% over the last year . The point being made , therefore , still stood . <p> After Portes supplied a copy of his correspondence with the UKSA , however , the newspaper offered to clarify the matter . It offered a wording that stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used for his analysis refer only to net changes in the number of foreign and British people in employment ; it is not possible on this basis to determine the number of ' new jobs ' " . <p> This was accepted by Portes as a reasonable resolution to his complaint , but the newspaper - following objections from Downing Street - withdrew it . It then offered to publish the following correction in its corrections column , in print and with the online article : <p> " Our item ' We 're building an immigration system that puts Britain first ' ( July 29 ) , stated that while most ' new ' jobs used to go to foreign workers , in the past year more than three quarters have gone to British workers . <p> We would like to make clear that the Office of National Statistics data on which this was based track net changes in employment , not ' new ' jobs .

" It acknowledged that there was a balance to be struck between presenting potentially complex statistics in a manner that was comprehensible to readers , and ensuring that the meaning of the statistics was not distorted . <p> In this instance , however , the commission concluded that the statistics to which the prime minister referred had been significantly misrepresented : there was a significant distinction between the numbers of people in employment and the allocation of new jobs . <p> While the commission reached this conclusion independently from the UKSA , it was relevant that the organisation , which is formally charged with ensuring good practice in relation to official statistics , had previously made public its position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpreted in this way . <p> The commission concluded that in publishing the claim the Telegraph had failed to take care not to publish misleading information , which placed it in breach of clause 1 of the editors ' code . <p> The paper was therefore required under the terms of the code to publish a correction . While the commission expressed significant concern about the newspaper 's withdrawal of an initial offer of correction that had constituted an appropriate and sufficient remedy to the breach of the code , it concluded that the subsequent correction it had proposed was sufficient to remedy the code breach . <p> It clearly identified the inaccuracy and adequately explained the meaning of the statistics . There was no requirement for the newspaper to refer to the separate CEP analysis , which suggested a contrary interpretation to that originally ( and baselessly ) made in the article . <p> The PCC concluded that newspaper should now publish the correction in order to avoid a breach of the code .

This body , long an expression of working-class solidarity with the Union and the Protestant values felt to underpin it , is expected to easily mobilise 10,000 people . <p> Jim Murphy himself is unlikely to be pleased at being lumped together with Orange Scots . When the march was announced he branded the Order as " unsavoury " and its initiative unhelpful . He is on a campaign tour which he has dubbed " 100 towns in 100 days " , and in Musselburgh on Monday I heard him talk about his own family 's roots in Donegal , Ireland and the far from smooth reception that ancestors got , presumably from anti-Catholics , as they tried to make their way in Scotland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Protestant fears and suspicion slowed the progress of Catholics who arrived in Scotland from Ireland to toil in the mines and build much of the country 's infrastructure , I share some of Jim Murphy 's reserve . <p> But I am still prepared to emit two cheers for the Orange Order , because of what I know of the recent history of Scotland . It is one of the puzzles of the deadly Ulster conflict that it had so little impact on its closest neighbour . In some of the most populous areas of Scotland , the communal tensions which wreaked such prolonged havoc in Ulster were faithfully duplicated . <p> One important explanation is the role played by Orange officials in defying hotheads who wished to smuggle arms to Ulster and even open up a new front in Scotland . It would have been easy to court cheap popularity by playing along with the militants . But during very tense times in the Seventies , the leadership kept them at bay . They cooperated with the authorities and even had discreet contact with the Catholic Church to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Ulster was n't further internationalised . <p> Its uniformed marchers beating drums and trilling flutes as they regularly march in Scotland 's cities during the summer months , sometimes present a stern and disharmonious image . But Scottish Orangeism is a force for moderation . <p> Along with the Catholic Church , it ensured that the raw social emotions which make Lowland Scotland one of the most volatile urban settings in the Western world , were not channelled into overt political conflict . Now the Catholic Church is retreating into itself , buffeted by falling numbers and clerical scandal . A vacuum has opened up among working-class Scots proud of their " rebel " Irish heritage . During this marathon referendum campaign , It has been increasingly filled by Yes Scotland , the SNP 's independence front . Ultra-leftists and strongly anti-British separatists have won over a large number of Irish-minded Scots , particularly middle-aged men . Some of them have been among the ugly crowds of Yes supporters who have tried to howl Jim Murphy down on his speaking tour . <p> Scottish Catholics are now splintered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times , the prospects for this downscale community 's survival as a coherent entity are bleak . The Orange Order is weathering these stormy times better . It gains inspiration from the 16th-century Reformation in which Scotland played a lead European role . But its Protestantism is pragmatic rather than confrontational . This is in tune with the fact that a great many Orange members are not regular churchgoers . Nevertheless , they still share an understanding that personal freedom and a system of law that elevates the individual over the state was shaped by the struggle against rigid Catholic hierarchy . <p> The Catholic Church has had troubles aplenty in Scotland , not least the sex scandal which drove Cardinal Keith O'Brien into premature retirement . But these woes have not been added to by the Orange Order . Its feisty monthly publication , the Orange Torch , has remained tight-lipped about the Church troubles which have made press headlines and brought gleeful attacks from militant secular forces . <p> Not for many years has the Orange Order attacked the existence of Catholic schools in Scotland which are paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outright , Orange leaders appear to recognise that by emphasising faith and morality in the curriculum and not an ethical free-for-all , these schools are attempting to do a lot of good in a troubled age . <p> So I , a Scottish Catholic historian , believe the Orange Order deserves to march through Scotland 's capital five days before the fate of the Union ( and perhaps much else besides ) will be decided . It has earned its rally through the good sense and moderation it has displayed during some turbulent times . If it regards Catholicism as a long-term problem then that is sad but it is largely its own affair . In an age of uniformity , in which laws are used to sometime outlaw legitimate differences of view , this is a tenable position to have . <p> Indeed when I see Catholic church leaders keeping a foolish silence in face of an independence drive which threatens to impoverish many ordinary Catholics , will probably result in the abolition of their schools , and is sure to place secularists in key positions of power , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a point about his Church . <p> If the Orange Order were to abandon its march , it would be a victory for the intimidation that increasingly has marked this campaign . The vandalised No placards across Scotland , the damage to cars with Better Together stickers , the mobbing of Jim Murphy 's rallies , and the bile that has coursed through social media from ultra-Nats , reveals a toxicity in the Scottish atmosphere that will be slow to disperse . If Edinburgh 's Orange march is a gesture of resistance , then this Catholic will definitely be there to cheer on fellow citizens who today are defending British civilisation . <p> Tom Gallagher is the author of The Illusion of Freedom : Scotland Under Nationalism , ( Hurst Publications , New York University Press , 2010 ) .

@@2774232 <p> To open any volume of David Kynaston 's history of postwar Britain is to experience the next best thing to time travel . In Mr Kynaston 's books the reader is drawn into a kaleidoscopic recreation , artfully weaving together diaries , letters , newspapers and increasingly , as the project reaches the 1960s , television programmes . These telling fragments form a richly textured whole . This week , the sixth volume appeared , covering events from the opening of the M1 in 1959 to the Beatles ' first recording session with George Martin in 1962 . A unifying theme is the demolition of 19th-century urban landmarks -- from the Gorbals to the Euston Arch -- and their replacement by tower blocks and shopping centres . T Dan Smith , not yet disgraced , bestrides the end of this volume . Mr Kynaston 's sequence is a dazzling achievement . The good news is that , at this rate , he still has six more volumes in him before he arrives at journey 's end in 1979.

Although Symbian was in hundreds of millions phones , and for years powered the most-bleeding edge mobile tech , Android today is everything Symbian set out to be : creating a rich platform for modern smartphones and tablets , on which other industries built their services . And that 's what makes this story interesting - much more interesting than if it had been a roaring success .

With Nokia putting huge resources behind Series 60 , Symbian 's share of the smartphone business rarely dipped below 60 per cent . It was practically the only game in town for creating rich devices for many years - without it ever being a consumer brand , as Android is today . <p> The the sheer volume of detail in David Wood 's book might overwhelm the casual reader .

" Could we have made a better decision - or done things differently ? " , he often asks . These counterfactuals probably help give us the most comprehensive account of the real dilemmas players in the mobile industry faced over the past two decades anyone has put to ( e- ) paper , as they pick out trends that are important but not obvious today . And Wood is so brutally candid and honest , nothing is spared . <p> Reading it , I was often left wondering how Symbian produced anything at all - let alone survived for so long .

Symbian was unable to deliver platform software on time for years - delays are the recurring motif of the book . It required device manufacturers to undertake painfully expensive integration , because the parts needed to make a Symbian phone did n't fit nicely - there were multiple UIs . The base ports ( code for a specific hardware ) , Wood writes , were immature or buggy . There should have been nice , off-the-shelf reference implementations - Linux at the time had hundreds .

" We had our handy , blame-defecting explanations " Wood writes . <p> Looking back at emails at another , particularly fraught period when Nokia - which had the biggest bet on Symbian - wanted some clarity from the company , Wood notes : <p> " I see only an intensely pragmatic attitude from the Nokia Calypso team , which elicited only faltering responses from the Symbian side .

@@2776238 <p> At half-time in this entertaining 2-2 draw , with Manchester City leading 1-0 and looking a finely tuned champion team , it will have been tempting for some to draw a neat and rather damning conclusion from the two key moments in the opening half-hour . First , Danny Welbeck had the opportunity to mark his Arsenal debut with a goal but instead hit the inside of the post . Then , 15 minutes later , Sergio Ag ? ero opened the scoring with his first chance , producing as if by way of riposte a sublime , almost dismissive close-range finish . At which point the narrative looked alluringly simple . There you have it : natural goalscorer versus natural athlete , predator versus omnivore , cut-throat razor versus all-round Swiss army knife . <p> And yet this would be wrong on several counts . First , it undervalues slightly the genuinely rare class of Ag ? ero 's finishing skills . Second , it drags Welbeck into the broader weaknesses of this lop-sided Arsenal team , whose lack of midfield solidity under pressure -- for all the fire and vigour of this performance -- was the real key to Ag ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Welbeck did bring to this team here , the unrelenting aggression and mobility through the centre that had been lacking from recent supine encounters with the top four and that was key to Arsenal 's second-half revival . <p> Welbeck may not have scored or assisted directly either of Arsenal 's two goals . He may have looked short on precision near goal at times . But alongside the excellent Alexis S ? nchez who is -- never mind the score , the opposition or the time of the day -- always up for a fight , he played a full part in the high-pressing aggression with which Arsenal wrenched their way back into this match . <p> These lunchtime kick-offs have , of course , provided some traumatic experiences in recent seasons , but as Wenger pointed out beforehand Arsenal have n't been losing these matches -- and indeed collapsing with all the resistance of an underdone meringue -- because of the time of day , but because of a lack of bite and mobility in the rump of the team . This point of weakness was there still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the way Mart ? n Demichelis was able to head City 's equaliser direct from a corner . But there was still much that was encouraging here , not least for Arsenal 's debutant , who started as a lone striker in a 4-1-4-1 formation . <p> First , though , that early chance . Welbeck did the first 97% brilliantly . Running on to David Silva 's poor back pass , he sprinted away from City 's defence and produced a lovely dink on the run , perfect in every way other than actually finding the net . Perhaps , in a game of this magnitude he should simply have put his foot through it ( " Maybe ... " Wenger said afterwards , sighing ) . And indeed Welbeck has some history with inappropriate dinks , having tried something similar against Bayern Munich in April . But this is to fall a little for the operetta of the occasion . He has also scored with similar finishes in the past . And it was , notwithstanding the width of the post , still a moment of encouraging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ero . The Argentinian always seemed an apt point of goalscoring comparison for Welbeck , dismissed rather curtly by Louis van Gaal in midweek as simply not up to United levels . Ag ? ero , on the other hand , is n't just a top striker : he 's the top striker , if you take the bald stats as your measure , with the best goals-per-game ratio in Premier League history and a habit of finding slivers of space in even the most compact defence . <p> Here Ag ? ero made his decisive intervention just before the half-hour . Naturally the simplicity of his finish -- sliding the ball past Wojciech Szczesny from eight yards as though Arsenal 's goalkeeper were simply there to retrieve it from the back of the net -- will provide an easy point of contrast with Welbeck . But it would be wrong to dwell too much on this . In fact the goal stemmed from a more central Arsenal weakness : the absence of a genuinely high-class defensive midfielder . Mathieu Flamini allowed Ag ? ero to run away from him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . Flamini delayed tracking back , judging incorrectly that the ball was going out , and was then unable to cut out the cross . City 's fans , who know their man , were already starting to celebrate as the ball reached Ag ? ero . <p> If Ag ? ero provided for an hour an example of the levels of all-round centre-forward play any striker would hope to reach , Welbeck 's most vital qualities were his vigour and aggression that contributed to Arsenal 's second-half surge . Manuel Pellegrini was adamant afterwards that Welbeck had fouled Vincent Kompany in the buildup to Arsenal 's second goal , but an accusation of strong arm tactics is in itself a change of tone . All that is required from here -- as ever -- is a goal or two . But as Welbeck left the pitch to generous applause the sense of promise was clear enough .

Since then they have brought in Radamel Falcao from Monaco and Daley Blind from Ajax , and have Luke Shaw and Marcos Rojo ready for debuts . Danny Welbeck came on as a substitute at Turf Moor , little realising he was playing his last game for United . Tyler Blackett 's appearances look likely to be limited by the availability of Rojo and Blind , while there may not be too many United games in the foreseeable future where Ashley Young , Darren Fletcher and Juan Mata all start . It means Van Gaal has two obvious options on Sunday against QPR ... <h> OPTION ONE <p> Sticking with the same formation , the side could look like this -- now that Phil Jones is out injured .

@@2797232 <p> If you have ever had a discussion about NHS-funded IVF you may well have heard - or even said - the following : ' why IVF and not cancer treatment ?

This opposition is , of course , highly upsetting for the thousands of couples struggling to conceive . But now , worryingly , the widespread antipathy is spreading to commissioners , and worsening the so-called ' postcode lottery ' . <p> In England the national recommendations say that women under 40 should be offered three ' full cycles ' of IVF after two years of unexplained infertility . A full cycle is defined as one round of ovarian stimulation and the transfer of all subsequent fresh and frozen embryos . <p> Unfortunately , commissioners seem to view these recommendations as a sort of ? -la-carte menu from which they can pick and choose ; altering the definition of a cycle , the age requirements , the number of cycles available , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation a ' postcode lottery ' fails to convey the sheer scale and depth of the variation . <p> To give examples from the data : there are 211 CCGs in England , Fertility Fairness ' survey covers 210 of these .

Worryingly these figures show a reduction of five percentage points from the previous year in the number of CCGs who commission the recommended three cycles . <p> But such disparities are just the start . At least 60 CCGs ( 29 percent ) require couples to spend three years attempting to conceive , rather than the recommended two years . Conversely , at least seven CCGs ( three percent ) -- require couples to wait one to two years even when there is a diagnosed cause of infertility . To clarify , these couples will not conceive naturally in this period ; this is just an enforced waiting list . <p> What 's more the audit could only find 68 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there could be up to 68 percent of CCGs using their own definition .

However they count any embryo transfer as a ' cycle ' , including the transfer of frozen embryos . This means that a woman could receive less than even one ' full cycle ' of treatment ( properly defined ) by these CCGs , yet they report themselves as compliant with national guidelines . <p> It does n't end there . Women under 40 are supposed to receive three full cycles of treatment but in at least 18 CCGs ( nine percent ) the cut-off age for treatment is 35 .

Instead the point is that commissioners must change their dismissive attitude towards infertility . <p> There is no other disease that is perceived to be of such low priority that commissioners feel free to change even the basic definition of the treatment .

@@2829237 <p> Richard Ayoade has asked to be interviewed in the Imperial War Museum . To find him in the museum 's cafe , I have to walk through the main entrance , where I 'm forced to stare down the barrels of two 50ft naval guns . When I finally reach him , sitting round the back in the museum 's grounds , I ask whether this is some kind of interview power play . <p> " I 'm actually doing a Charlton Heston , announcing my support of the NRA , " he deadpans . " No , to be honest it just feels not terribly media-y here , and it 's quite close to my house . " <p> I 'm only a tad suspicious because these are unusual circumstances in which to conduct an interview . There should be plenty to talk about : Ayoade 's comedy career , including his Bafta-winning sitcom role as Moss , the socially-inept star of Graham Linehan 's The IT Crowd , as well as his two acclaimed films as a director , Submarine and The Double , which , alongside the recent output of Ben Wheatley and Edgar Wright , have made him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Ayoade 's latest work -- a book , Ayoade on Ayoade -- is an interview itself , in which two fictional versions of the man antagonise one another . <p> That might sound like a mildly amusing conceit for a traditional autobiography , but Ayoade 's actual life is almost entirely absent , his work barely mentioned . The book is more of a surreal and hilarious exercise in self-aggravation . For example , one exchange runs like this : " I read somewhere that you regard your Jewish identity as being important to you . " " It 's very important . It 's foundational . " " And yet you 're not Jewish . " " No . " " And you do n't find that problematic ? " " Not at all . I do n't think whether I 'm Jewish or not is really relevant to my Jewish identity . " " Would you call yourself a practising Jew ? " " I use to play guitar but I do n't really have time for it any more . " <p> As well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satirisation of the nature of interviews and the culture of personality itself . In one exchange , drenched in typical sarcasm , Ayoade asks himself , " What 's next for you ? " , to which he replies , " Eventually I 'd like to see the interviews replace the directing ... the prospect of needing to make a whole film before a stranger tapes my thoughtless utterances and uses them as the basis for a speculative , semi-hostile character portrait makes me very sad . " <p> If that 's his fear about our meeting , he does n't show it initially . In fact he 's quite forthcoming as we talk about cinema and comedy . He tells me lots about film I did n't know : the ways in which Woody Allen makes nods to Ingmar Bergman ; that the 1960 film Zazie Dans le Metro is useless for teaching yourself French , as Ayoade attempted as a teenager , because the titular character speaks in slang and purposeful mispronunciation . <p> Pretty quickly though , it 's obvious that though I am asking the questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask him about himself , he 's more evasive . He has a series of techniques for turning the conversation to other things . One is self-deprecation . When I ask him why he did n't write a more traditional book about his life he replies , " I do n't think I could have done . No one had asked me to write the book . I do n't think there 's any demand for my life story , or a supply . As an economic model , both sides are absent . " I point out that has n't stopped a host of people with far less to say . <p> When that does n't work , he tries to turn a specific question about his life into a general one about film , peppering it with relatively obscure references to pre-1960s cinema , of which his knowledge is spectacular , to keep things on his terms . <p> What he 's trying to avoid , he admits , is " the Faustian pact with the media to cannibalise my personality " . He 's not difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock band who 's rude for the sake of it .

" <p> He tells me about an improv game where the actor is auditioning for a soap commercial but knows the director is also casting for Hamlet , so the player has to drop hints about his capacity for Shakespearean gravitas while in the shower . " So , I guess the underlying current of interviews is , ' Think I 'm a nice person , here 's my product . Allow me to be self-aggrandising in a self-deprecating way ' .

He went to Cambridge where he studied law and joined the revered student comedy society Footlights . Being one of its few non-white stars and experiencing comedy success at such a young age all seems fruitful personal history from which to draw on in his work . But he remains distrustful of such biographical inquiries . <p> " There are plenty of examples of people where you 're able to enjoy the literature before interviews . Unless people go : ' Oh God , Chaucer , he needed to be humanised . If only I knew what made him tick , I could engage with him . ' " <p> One record that does exist of his beginnings in comedy comes from a documentary the local ITV station made about Footlights at the time . You can see Ayoade alongside a young John Oliver , both in fetching 1990s sweaters , walking along a windswept beach , apparently improvising .

Also , we were in this stage when we were just trying to be Chris Morris . Everyone spoke in that I 'M TALKING LIKE THIS voice , all the way through . And it 's documented in this awful video , it 's really humiliating . " <p> This local TV puff piece triggered a permanent unease with appearing in front of camera outside of a clearly demarcated performance . He did the interviews for his first TV shows in character , and says he constructed a sort of public personality for himself from then on . In person , with no camera on , you do n't get any of that slightly dumbfounded geekery you see when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were on Radio 4 . <p> Why is it so difficult for him to be himself ? " As soon as cameras are there it 's just different . It 's not being yourself . Your mother could have died that morning but they will say , ' Just be yourself , we have to film ' . Anything that 's not complete submission to the gaze looks kind of aggressive on camera . Reality stars are geniuses in that they have an ability to be completely undefensive . Joey Essex , for example , is completely open , so you like him . The villains are the defensive ones ; shyness can be interpreted as a kind of aggression : ' Who are you to care so much how you come off ? ' " <p> Three years after graduating , Ayoade won the Perrier award at the Edinburgh fringe for co-writing and performing in Garth Marenghi 's Netherhead , a show that became a cult Channel 4 comedy . He worked alongside the likes of Noel Fielding , Matt Berry and Rich Fulcher on shows such as The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional entertainment roles , appearing on panel shows and hosting Channel 4 's technology show Gadget Man , in which again , although presenting " as himself " , he plays a character -- a sort of overly-serious and over-enthused news reporter . Think Stephen Sackur doing a One Show segment . <p> But when Ayoade made the move into directing , something more than the humour and the front shone through . Both 2010 's Submarine , an atmospheric and honest secondary school romance in a small Welsh town , and this year 's The Double , in which Jesse Eisenberg plays both a nervous and ignored office worker and his confident , sexually successful doppelganger , are sensitive adaptations -- the former from Joe Dunthorne 's novel , the latter the Dostoevsky classic . Ayoade proved able to present young romance in a way that feels neither cliched nor overblown , and when things fall apart in his films it 's genuinely heartbreaking . I think few of his comedy contemporaries could have handled these stories so tenderly . Surely that ability to engage with the human condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To me , there 's not necessarily a distinct separation between something being funny and something being sad . It can be funny tripping over at a funeral at the worst moment , or getting annoyed if you ca n't find a parking space . Catcher in the Rye is the funniest book and the saddest book . You can juxtapose things , there are a thousand juxtapositions an A-level student could come up with . " <p> Sorry , your browser is unable to play this video . <p> The trailer for The Double <p> But not any A-level student could direct a film with that level of emotional maturity . Does he not draw on anything to tell those stories ? " Yes , but with a lot of things you 're not as outside of it as it might come across . You just go , I think this is funny or interesting or seems appropriate . Especially in a film , with the number of people doing it with you , the cameraman , and in this case the co-writer , the actors who might say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel right . " Quickly , it 's back to Bergman . " It 's like saying why is a close-up in a Bergman film seemingly better than a close-up in other films ? Everyone has access to those lenses and you could hire those actors , what is it ? It 's just something about him , at that time , with those people . " <p> Evade , self-deprecate , move it along . It kind of works , but I wonder if there is some onus on Ayoade to engage more with the world he works in . For example , does he not feel as one of the few black people on television , he might want to join recent calls for more diversity in television ? <p> " The thing is , what 's my mandate ? I feel you need to earn the right to weigh in on complex issues , and that right is probably not granted to you by being moderately efficient at imparting words so that they 're amusing . On some level , I ca n't get away from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monday ' . The danger is , you trivialise what you 're saying , because there 's a commercial element attached , you might have something to gain .

" What 's difficult is that you could probably have a frank conversation with someone you know well about sensitive issues , but it 's almost irresponsible to talk about those issues if you do n't know the format or how it might come across . " Is n't that being neurotic ? Surely there are some issues , particularly within the entertainment industry , that he would be uniquely placed to comment on . He does n't budge . " If we were just talking among ourselves , it 'd be much easier , but there 's a recording device , which turns it into a statement , something you have to have thought about , something you maybe even need to defend . This is the only difference between me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contract is : ' Let 's watch you ' . With performers or writers , the contract is , ' Show us the thing you 've thought about ' . It ca n't be , ' You 've really thought about this song Jack White , let 's hear it but also , what do you think about Chad ? ' He 's not the guy to talk about Chad . " <p> ' The elephant in the room of any interview is , consume this product ' ... Richard Ayoade . Photograph : Antonio Olmos for the Guardian <p> We continue in this combative vein for a while . At one point he says , " It 's hard to read Nigerian playwright Wole Soyinka without any knowledge of Yoruba culture , but it should n't be something you ca n't enjoy without a reading list , " and then trails off , realising he might have pushed the deflection too far . " That does n't feel like it 's going to be the pull quote , does it ? " <p> The thing is , when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relaxed conversation -- we talk a bit about grim bits of London and the tin-pot dictators who can be involved in student organisations . His unwillingness to ramble is n't a personality trait but a meticulousness , making sure that if he 's saying something , it 's the right thing , which is why he 'll steer conversation back to the area in which he 's sure and comfortable . <p> I 'd come to unpick Ayoade 's hysterical but slightly farcical book in which he interviews himself . Instead I added one more layer to the self-conscious mess . An interview about interviews to promote an interview where the interviewer is the interviewee , who hates interviews .

Wearing a grey suit and one of his " 12 or so " University of Hong Kong ( HKU ) ties , the 55-year-old Englishman sits back in his 10th-floor office and reflects on his new role . " I 'm happy about the way it 's gone -- in terms of the way I feel , in terms of the way I 've been received , in terms of my personal life , " he says four months into his tenure as HKU 's vice-chancellor and president . <p> While not dodging the fact that his appointment a year ago was greeted with a fierce backlash among students , alumni and staff , he plays the controversy down as though it were simply another occupational hazard . So how has he responded to the disapproval that included accusations from senior colleagues of being " ignorant and incapable " and of having " a complete lack of understanding " of China and Hong Kong ? <p> " I 've learned a hell of a lot in the last six months , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faculty of medicine and dentistry at the University of Bristol in the UK . " The politics here is complicated and rapidly changing , so you 've got to run to keep up . But I 'm enjoying it and so far it seems to be going OK . " <p> The political situation is certainly complex -- and now Prof Mathieson is " enmeshed " in it . Hong Kong is in the grip of a fierce dispute between Beijing loyalists and democracy activists who have brought areas of the city to a standstill with a campaign of peaceful civil disobedience . Occupy Central , one of the groups involved in the " umbrella revolution " protests , was founded by an HKU professor , while one of the movement 's student leaders is an HKU student . Hailing from Hong Kong 's former colonial power -- which never gave local people the vote -- Prof Mathieson is in a sensitive position . <p> He deftly steers through the topic of the territory 's universal suffrage , stating his support for democratic principles while refusing to align himself with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " , and warning that " getting to the goal is one thing , but the method of getting there can have unintended consequences ; people have to be very careful about that " . <p> As an English-speaking university in China , we 're fantastically placed to exploit the opportunities in the mainland <p> Beyond politics , Prof Mathieson finds himself head of an institution in an enviable position . Founded in 1911 , HKU is arguably the most venerable university in the Chinese territory , with a history and brand that Mathieson admits " must irritate the hell out of younger universities " . It is also healthily funded , he says -- when colleagues complain of being under-resourced , he feels " like saying to them , ' you should try working in the UK ' -- because actually the contrast is really striking " . <p> Perhaps HKU 's most striking advantage , however , is its role as an English-speaking university in greater China -- a unique bridge between the rising Asian giant and the established western academic order . This has helped generate fierce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3,400 spaces for 2013-14 , " we get the best students , so we 're in a great position : we are attractive to students and staff " , says Prof Mathieson . ( Government policy is that 80 per cent of undergraduate places must go to Hong Kong " locals " . ) <p> But the university 's biggest challenge , he says , is to avoid resting on its laurels . In recent years HKU has successfully manoeuvred the potentially wrenching change from a three-year to a four-year curriculum , built a new state of the art campus housing the faculties of arts , law and social science , and celebrated its centenary . <p> Prof Mathieson says the biggest danger now " is to avoid any kind of loss of momentum , to avoid any complacency based on 100 years of distinguished heritage and to seize the opportunities which face us now -- of which mainland China is clearly the major one " . <p> At a time when Beijing is extending its political influence over its territory , Prof Mathieson swiftly quashes the notion that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English-speaking university and embracing the future as Hong Kong becomes ever more assimilated into its mainland parent . <p> Heads on the block : pro-democracy activists have their heads shaved in protest at the Beijing government last month <p> " Hong Kong is part of China now and in 33 years will be even more a part of China , so that has to be the future . But I do n't think that 's at the expense of HKU being a global university -- the two are inextricably linked . Every university in the UK , and probably in North America and Australasia as well , wants links with mainland China . <p> " As an English-speaking university in China , with our heritage , 100-year history and links with distinguished universities around the world , we 're fantastically placed to exploit the opportunities in the mainland and I do n't want to be deflected by politics from achieving that .

" There 's going to come a time when they no longer need Hong Kong or HKU as a window to the rest of the world . I do n't know how long that period will be -- probably 10 or 20 years . The opportunity for us is now and if we do n't seize it , we 'll miss it . " <p> And HKU 's position in global league tables is under threat . It slipped two places to 28th in the QS World University Rankings 2014/15 , although its nearest rival , the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology , suffered an even greater decline , dropping six places to 40th . Among Asia-Pacific universities , HKU -- once regarded as the region 's premier institution -- was in second place but remained the number one in greater China . <p> Prof Mathieson brushes aside the notion that such rankings should dictate university policy . " We have to aspire to excellence in everything we do , " he says . " We have to pursue the initiatives we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we do everything successfully the league tables will follow , and if the league tables do n't follow then they 're not judging the criteria we want to be judged by . " <p> Competitors have also stolen a march on HKU in their links to business . Prof Mathieson admits initial surprise at the slowness with which the university seems to have built alliances with the corporate world , suggesting there should be a requirement " that we contribute more to society , we engage more with industry , we have more spin-out from our research " . <p> But with the territory 's days as an industrial hub long behind it , if HKU is to build relationships with industry , " we 're going to have to look outside Hong Kong , including the mainland " . To that end , it has embarked on a series of ventures with mainland organisations .

Media reports suggested with the hospital running at only a quarter of its capacity , HKU had already spent HK$200m ( $26m ) and stood to lose many hundreds of millions more over the next decade . <p> Prof Mathieson denies this , saying his " current understanding " is that the money will not be lost -- but he suggests the project was set up without the crucial goal to " augment our teaching and create new research opportunities that would n't otherwise exist " . While pulling the plug on the project " has to be an option " , he still sees " enough opportunity " to " remain engaged " . <p> The need for such partnerships , Prof Mathieson says , " is another reason why we should overcome the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because this is another area where we need to develop " . <p> As he sets out his plans to navigate HKU through the tricky waters ahead , Prof Mathieson hopes his critics will judge him on his " actions and on the outcomes " . <p> " Clearly , as soon as I do something stupid or make a big mistake , these people will probably come back , but I consider my job quite simple .

@@2834232 <p> Britain 's growing army of private landlords are battling to maintain returns in the face of rising property prices . An almost certain increase in mortgage rates over the coming months is n't helping . <p> As a result , many are turning to refurbishments as a way of boosting total profits . <p> The strategy involves buying run-down homes and swiftly increasing their value by undertaking a radical refurbishment . Lenders say more landlords are now hoping to buy property in need of major work cheaply , with the intention of undertaking drastic refurbishment - adding more rooms in the process - before putting it on the rental market . <p> In part this is because of a trend towards " HMO " investing , where multiple tenants live together in a single " house in multiple occupation " . As Telegraph Money has reported , this is generally seen as the highestyielding form of buying-to-let . <p> Refurbishment not only increases the value of the investment , landlords say , but also cuts down on long-term maintenance costs and attracts higherquality tenants who tend to stay put for longer . <p> But there 's a catch . While investors have their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affordability tests imposed on owner-occupiers - financing for a refurbishment project is harder to obtain . <p> Traditionally most investors wanting to refurbish would pay cash or , especially where they have large portfolios , raise mortgages on one property in order to pay upfront to refurbish the next . Once that project is complete they raise a loan against it , and so on . <p> But this process can entail multiple applications , booking fees , valuations and surveys - and even early repayment charges on the initial mortgage . <p> ' I would n't be able to borrow elsewhere ' <p> Hazel Clarke has been investing in buy-to-let properties for 15 years , and knows this problem well . She exclusively buys rundown properties to refurbish and rent . <p> " I always want to put my own stamp on a property , " she said . " I 'm horrified at the standard of the rental properties I buy .

@@2837238 <h> You are here <h> Driveclub : the Top Gear review <h> Read more on : <p> You wait all year for a decent next-gen racing game , and then four come along all at once . Following The Crew , Forza Horizon 2 and Project Cars , here 's Driveclub - a PS4 exclusive from the studio that bought you rather excellent and under-rated Motorstorm . <p> The game takes place around small clubs , each with no more than six members . Being a member of a club gives you access to special challenges and races , and the success of every individual benefits the club as a whole . So , for example , game director Paul Rustchynsky told TG.com that there are ten cars where once one member wins access to it , the whole club has it . Leave the club , and you lose the car . <p> From the main menu then , you have a few options . Besides Online , you can dive into Tour mode , or specify a single race , time trial or drift event and set the parameters yourself . There are a fair few races in Tour to keep you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your club . But so centered on social interaction is Driveclub , that without an internet connection , or indeed any online friends , the game 's appeal is severely limited . <p> So , we head online . In a mechanic similar to the likes of the recent Burnout games , every now and then a challenge will pop up mid-race , encouraging you to beat a random opponent 's or a friend 's score over a specified piece of track . The score might relate to drifting , or how closely you can stick to the racing line . You 're free to ignore them , but they do at least vary the car-to-car action . <p> These challenges earn you Fame Points - the scoring metric around which Driveclub is based . Mostly , you earn them without really trying . Travelling at high-speed , drafting , drifting and clean overtakes will all net a few hundred at a time - but start wantonly bashing into other drivers or cutting corners , and you may soon find yourself with only a few to your name . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the original roster to muck around with , including the usual suspects - everything from Golf GTIs to McLaren P1s . Fifty may not sound very many , especially given the hundreds on offer in the competition , but the team will be releasing an additional 38 cars as DLC - some of which will be free - over the next nine months . Jamie Brayshaw , Senior Community Manager at Evolution , told TG.com that each car takes nine man-months to model and build . That should give you some indication of just how good these things look . Which is very good indeed . <h> Related content <p> And those all-important physics ? They take some getting used to , but once you have , there is a welcome amount of difference in how the cars drive and react . An Audi RS6 feels very stable and solid , and a BAC Mono much pointier and trickier to control . The sense of speed makes the racing seem frantic and immediate , but too frequently you pick up a penalty for innocently falling off the track , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Bentley Continental . <p> You have five locations to race in : Canada , Scotland , Chile , Norway and India . Each location boasts 11 tracks - a mix of circuits and point-to-points . There are no real-world tracks in Driveclub , but that did n't stop the developers from rendering everything in excellent detail . Dynamic weather in the form of rain and snow will be added in the next couple of months ( we had a quick go , it already looks great ) . Elect to start a race on a sunny day , but pick rain , and you 'll have to wait for clouds to form before they start spitting . And once the rain stops , dry-lines will appear more quickly , in say , Chile than Scotland , because in Chile the ambient temperature is so much higher . It 's the most ambitious weather-modelling we 've seen yet in a driving game . <p> Weather is n't the only thing that 'll be added .

They can tweak the relative performance of cars , or alter how corner-cutting penalties are applied for example . Then there 's the DLC - 38 cars over nine months and a few tracks . All of the track and game updates - like weather - will be free . <p> Driveclub sits atop that pointy fence that separates your iRacings from your Need For Speeds . In Fame Points and clubs , you have the scoring system and social integration we 've seen so many times before , but in the stunning visuals and impressive attention to detail , you have a game that more closely resembles Forza 5 or Gran Turismo . They 've tried to make a game that appeals to all racing fans , and in that they have broadly succeeded . <p> But there are flaws .

And it scans your entire fingerprint when calibrating , rather than just the central part . <p> As such it 's able to be much more forgiving of fingerprints placed at an angle or non-centrally . I still experienced plenty of ' non-recognised fingerprint ' messages , but it automatically rescans without any extra interaction required within a fraction of a second .

It works without getting near the power button too .

It also reports a sharper rise in the cost of fruit and veg over the past decade compared to other types of foods . <p> This news story is based on research which looked at changes in the price of 94 food items in the UK in the decade from 2002 to 2012 . It found that in this period foods classified as healthier ( such as fruit and vegetables ) were more expensive per calorie than foods high in fat or sugar . The healthy foods increased more sharply in price over time , and in 2012 were three times more expensive on average per calorie than unhealthy foods . <p> Prices were assessed per 1,000 calories , as this is a standard way of assessing food poverty . However , as healthier foods tend to have a much lower energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foods , this measure may not always give a realistic comparison of different food choices you might buy . For example , you would need to buy and eat around 30 cucumbers to gain around 1,000 calories , compared to about one 200g packet of ginger nut biscuits ( about 20 biscuits ) . <p> Given the recent economic climate and also concerns about diet-related health conditions , this is likely to be of interest to policy makers , as well as the public . This sort of information could contribute to discussions about whether changing food pricing could motivate people to eat more healthily . <p> We have also calculated you can eat the recommended five a day of fruit and vegetables for as little as 50p a day ; the cost of a standard mid-morning snack . <h> Where did the story come from ? <p> This research was carried out by researchers at the University of Cambridge and the University of East Anglia . The study was funded by the British Heart Foundation , Cancer Research UK , Economic and Social Research Council , Medical Research Council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wellcome Trust , and took place in a UK Clinical Research Collaboration centre . One of the authors was funded by the Gates Cambridge Trust . <h> What kind of research was this ? <p> This was a time trend study , looking at how the costs of more and less healthy foods changed over time in the UK . They used two sources of routinely available UK government data , as they hoped their method could be a way to routinely monitor how affordability of these foods is changing over time . They say that their study is the first to use UK data to assess price trends by nutrient composition of foods . <p> The researchers report that diet related ill health has been estimated to cost the NHS ? 5.8 billion per year -- more than smoking , alcohol , or physical inactivity . Although consuming healthier foods is linked to better health outcomes , many people in the UK do not meet healthy eating recommendations . The researchers describe one survey which found that 39% of people rated price as the most important factor in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's healthiness to be most important . <p> So if healthier food is more expensive , this could be a significant barrier to people eating more healthily . <h> What did the researchers do ? <p> The researchers selected 94 foods and drinks and classified them as " more healthy " or " less healthy " based on their calorie and nutrient contents . They identified their costs from 2002 to 2012 , and compared the prices of the " more healthy " and " less healthy " foods over time to see how they differed . <p> Foods and drinks were chosen from UK Consumer Price Index ( CPI ) , which the government uses to track the prices of commonly bought and used goods and services every quarter to measure inflation . The researchers used only those foods and drinks which remained in the survey between 2002 and 2012 , and that did not include an element of service ( for example a meal in a pub ) . They also excluded non-calorie containing foods such as tea bags , coffee and mineral water . This left them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average cost for each item for each year . <p> The researchers also obtained weight of the items where this was reported in CPI , or estimated the weight based on information on prices for similar items online , or for items with varying weights ( such as individual fruit ) by using the US Department of Agriculture 's National Nutrient Database standard reference weights . <p> The nutrient contents of the items was obtained using the UK Department of Health 's National Diet and Nutrition Survey . This survey includes detailed nutritional information on the foods eaten by 1,491 adults . The researchers identified the best match or matches to each of their 94 items from the survey . In some cases there were multiple similar items -- for example , if the CPI item was a potato , the survey could contain nutritional information on boiled , baked , and fried potatoes . In these cases the researchers took the average nutritional values . The weight and nutritional information per weight data allowed researchers to calculate costs of each item per 1,000 kilocalories ( kcal ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of protein food and drinks high in fat and /or sugar <p> The researchers also used a Department of Health tool which assigns an overall score to foods based on their level of nutrients per 100g , which allows classification of foods as " more healthy " or " less healthy " based on their score . <p> The researchers used statistical tests to see if the prices of the " more healthy " and " less healthy " foods , or different Eatwell categories differed over time . <h> What were the results of the study ? <p> Average prices for both more and less healthy food rose by 35% between 2002 and 2012 , from ? 3.87 per 1,000kcal to ? 5.21 per 1,000kcal . <p> Price per 1,000kcal was always highest for fruit and veg , lowest for starchy foods ( bread , rice , potatoes and pasta ) , and second lowest for foods and drinks high in fat and/or sugar . The price of starchy foods per 1,000kcal stayed roughly the same between 2002 and 2012 , while the other groups showed price rises . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruit and veg , contained both foods classified as more healthy and some as less healthy . <p> Healthier foods increased in price per 1,000kcal more rapidly than less healthy foods . Healthier foods increased in price by an average of 17 pence per 1,000kcal per year while less healthy foods rose seven pence per 1,000kcal per year . <p> In 2012 the average price of more healthy foods was about three times higher -- ? 7.49 for 1,000kcal compared to ? 2.50 for 1,000kcal of less healthy foods . <h> How did the researchers interpret the results ? <p> The researchers concluded that " Since 2002 , more healthy foods and beverages have been consistently more expensive than less healthy ones , with a growing gap between them . " They say that this trend may worsen social inequalities in health , and affect the population 's health as a whole . They also suggest that the findings support routinely monitoring food prices to inform possible economic policy responses . <h> Conclusion <p> The current study has found that the price of food per calorie in the UK between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for less healthy food . The suggestion is that this may affect people 's food choices , and therefore their long term health . <p> The method the researchers used took advantage of routinely available government data on food prices and nutritional content . This means it would not require collection of new data to keep track of healthy and unhealthy food prices per calorie . <p> There are some limitations to the findings , which the authors themselves discuss , including the small number of foods and drinks they assessed , as they were restricted to using those listed in the UK Consumer Price Index between 2002 and 2012 . However , the index includes commonly bought items . <p> They assessed price per calorie , rather than price per unit weight , as this is the way international organisations assess food poverty . Also dietary recommendations are given in terms of calories rather than weight of food . However , one of the reasons for less healthy foods to be classed as less healthy is that they have high levels of calories per gram . So it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less per calorie than more healthy foods such as fruit and veg , which tend to have fewer calories per gram . Building on this research to estimate the price of healthy and unhealthy diets as a whole , or also presenting prices per weight could help in giving an idea of the practical day to day impact of these differences . <p> This study has added another layer to the information available about food prices in the UK , linking it to nutritional value . Given the recent economic climate and also concerns about diet-related health conditions , this is likely to be of interest to both the public and policy makers .

" Broadly speaking , that 's actually just a bullshit notion . The kind of distinctions we make about photography are so banal .

" Certain works of fiction -- Catch-22 , Norman Mailer 's The Naked and the Dead , WG Sebald 's On the Natural History of Destruction , Primo Levi 's If This Is a Man , Terrence Malick 's The Thin Red Line -- act as my proxy for conflict much more than any photograph ever has .

One of the great tragedies of the Holocaust is that few images were produced inside the camps . " At the time , Hollywood 's Catch-22 was the most expensive movie ever produced -- it was shot over six months on San Carlos , an untouched desert island off Mexico .

" Images jump off the page and scramble our brains . They tell us to be afraid , that we are illegitimate , not perfect , " he says of the filtered , processed , post-production perfect images that saturate us in advertising and messaging .

@@2847231 <h> Women in computing : the 60s pioneers who lit up the world of coding <p> Ada Lovelace Day celebrates the success of the world 's first computer programmer . But did you know that the UK 's leading software pioneers were also women ? Their story is inspiring for young women today <p> Tuesday is Ada Lovelace Day . Who 's Ada Lovelace , apart from someone with a truly bitchin ' steampunk name ? Well , she deserves all the brass-and-clockwork associations her name brings up because she was probably the world 's first computer programmer . She was born in 1815 , and studied maths and logic out of a deep personal interest . She befriended and worked with mathematician Charles Babbage , and her ideas for how Babbage 's Analytical Engine might work prefigure modern computer science . Ada Lovelace Day was founded to celebrate the achievements of women in science , technology , engineering and maths ( Stem ) . <p> And because Lovelace 's achievements were in programming , I want to celebrate two other women who lit up the world of coding . Did you know that two of the first software houses worthy of the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late 1950s and early 1960s ? And that they both made -- and this is n't emphasised enough in lists of women 's achievements , in my view -- enormous piles of cash doing it ? And that this was n't so unusual in the 1950s and 60s , because there was a brief period where coding was seen as " women 's work " , as it involves a lot of focus on detail and typing ( coding is overwhelmingly male today ) ? If you did n't know these things -- and I did n't until I started digging -- then it 's about time we celebrated the work of Dina St Johnston and Dame Stephanie " Steve " Shirley . <p> The 1960s were n't the sexiest years in UK computing history . Unlike the Enigma machines of the 1940s , or the 1980s personal computing revolution , the 1960s brought computers to bear on far more mundane matters : train signalling , payroll automation , banking systems , air-traffic control . The kind of computing we never think about , but that underlies almost every aspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it really ca n't be emphasised frequently enough -- there was a lot of money to be made . <p> Before the late 1950s , there were no " software houses " . That is , there was no one actually making all the programs you might run on your home computer today . If you bought a computer -- and do n't think of a sleek MacBook Air , imagine one of those machines the size of a room that ran on reel-to-reel spooling tape , instead -- it was supplied as " bare metal " , and you 'd have to write all the programs yourself . It was thought no one but a science department or a technical firm employing their own programs would want one . <p> Dina St Johnston ( nee Vaughan ) had always had an independent streak , her friend , Colin Porter , chief executive and secretary of the Institute of Railway Signal Engineers , told me . She left school at 17 to join pioneering computer firm Elliot Brothers , where she learned programming -- and thought she had spotted a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly to the industry or , as she put it , as quoted in the Computer Journal in 2008 : " There was a shortage of processor-oriented people who were happy to go round a steel works in a hard hat . " Dina St Johnston , however , loved working with machinery , and rejoiced in putting on the hard hat ; later in life she collected fast cars and drove them at enormous speed around the private roads on her estate . She founded Vaughan Programming Services in 1959 , the first software house in the UK . They created software for the BBC , Unilever , BAA , British Rail and GEC . She produced pioneering real-time passenger information systems -- the forerunner of those clickety-click timetable boards in stations up and down the country -- and flight simulators for the RAF . When she died in 2007 , one obituary said that she 'd " left a lasting contribution to both the art and science of programming " -- and the company she founded still exists , now as a part of GE . <p> Stephanie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child in 1939 . " I think my ' guilt ' about surviving the Holocaust gave me a strong urge to succeed , " she has said , " to prove that my life had been worth saving . " She took a maths degree at night school and founded her software house , Freelance Programmers , from her dining room table in 1962 . She wanted to be able to work while raising her family , and was determined to help other women do the same . Shirley only employed female programmers until 1975 , when the Equal Opportunities Act meant she had to open up applications to men . Her company , renamed Xansa , was listed on the FTSE-250 and sold software in areas including banking , transport and telecoms . Since retiring , Shirley has become a philanthropist ; her late son Giles was autistic , and she takes a particular interest in autism charities . I met Steve Shirley once , and told her how much I admired her : for the company she created from nothing , and for her philanthropy today . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a lot of fun making the money , and now I 'm having a lot of fun giving it away . " <p> I 've gone on a lot about the money in this piece . The thing is , there are n't enough messages to young women that technology is a fascinating area to work in , a fast-moving field , one that rewards hard work , an area where you really can change the world . And there also are n't enough people saying to young women : a million dollars is n't cool , you know what 's cool ? Selling the multimillion-dollar programming company you founded and then spending the cash on whatever you like , from fast cars to charitable giving . And these two amazing women were two of the first people in the UK to do just that . There is not a reason on Earth it could n't be you , or your daughter . Happy Ada Lovelace Day . 
@@2847233 <h> The continued market sell-off is due to a combination of different events making investors worry <p> What , exactly , is going on in the financial markets ? The FTSE 100 crept up on Monday but at just 6,366.24 remains terribly depressed . Stock markets around the world have lost a substantial amount of value in recent days , with gains for the year wiped out and more . The commodities and fixed income markets are also all over the place and advisers are reporting that several flotations on the London market have been cancelled or delayed indefinitely . <p> The good news is that the UK economy is not about to tip into recession but it is clear that the international outlook has worsened significantly . Investors are paying the price for seven major developments in the global economy , some predicted and others not . <p> 1 . Germany feeling eurozone slowdown <p> The first and most immediate worry is the ongoing slowdown in the eurozone , led by its supposedly most powerful economies . Capital Economics highlights the weakness of Germany 's industrial production and trade data and is predicting that there is a good chance that German GDP shrank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , exacerbated by Russian sanctions ( the US ones being much tougher on Germany than the EU ones ) and weak demand for exports . <p> The world today is looking very different from where it was earlier in the cycle , when Germany was recovering and the UK was struggling . That was an aberration ; we are now back to a more normal pattern , with Germany in long-term decline . As the economist Philippe Legrain points out in a brilliant essay for CapX , Germany 's GDP growth since 2000 has averaged just 1.1pc a year , a far weaker performance than other rich countries . Its share of world exports is down from 9.1pc in 2007 to 8pc last year and investment has slumped from 22.3pc of GDP a few years back to 17pc in 2013 . The eurozone 's slowdown and Germany 's decline are bad news for everybody , of course , including the UK . <p> The second shock is the Ebola epidemic , described by the World Health Organisation as the worst health emergency of modern times . It is principally a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the global economy . Fewer people are travelling by plane from key locations , trade and business routes are being badly affected , the price of commodities such as cocoa is increasing and the stock price of many companies has tanked . <p> At this stage , all predictions for the eventual economic impact should be taken with a big pinch of salt . Previous pandemics , such as Sars , had a large impact in places such as Hong Kong but the economic effects dissipated rapidly . What we do know is that , at the very least , the global economy will be impacted for the remainder of this year and the hit to global financial markets is thus perfectly rational . <p> 3 . Oil <p> The third big change is the sliding price of oil , which some are taking , perhaps unfairly , as signalling a global slowdown . The reality is more nuanced : oil prices are down as a result of increased supply in Russia and the US , and reduced demand from slowing economies . <p> In any case , lower prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ import a lot -- and bad news for net producers -- those who export more than they buy from abroad . The price of oil is like a tax for the former group of nations , which now includes the UK as a result of the North Sea 's decline , and akin to a transfer for the latter , which is why Venezuela is calling a meeting of Opec ministers to try and stem crude 's bear market . <p> The hit to Gulf nations ' coffers means reduced cash to buy exports and to invest in real or financial assets around the world . The slump in oil prices is also bad for shale : it can only be exploited profitably when oil prices are relatively elevated . Needless to say , oil companies , including those listed in London , have seen their share prices fall , pushing down overall indices . On balance , however , and in the short term , the reduced price of oil is good for the British economy . <p> 4 . Fed turning off taps <p> The next , ongoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US . This is n't new , and other economies , including Japan , are still creating ultra-cheap money . But markets always want more and their bottomless appetite for loose money is n't being satisfied . While there was too much QE in the US and UK -- and traders and investors should be ashamed of their addiction to freshly-created money -- they are right to want more from the European Central Bank . <p> The eurozone is the one part of the world where additional injections of liquidity would be good news -- not for the whole region but for various struggling parts of it . Yet the Frankfurt-based central bank is stuck : it has gone as far as it can politically but that is n't enough . <p> Many forecasters are predicting regional deflation in the medium-term -- with prices falling for the wrong reasons , upping the real value of debt and creating all sorts of other problems . <p> 5 . Emerging markets <p> It is not just the eurozone that is slowing : China has also underperformed , as have some other emerging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than 7pc in the third quarter , according to Capital Economics -- bad by that country 's usually stellar standards -- but the market reaction is more a case of investors finally noticing that the new normal in emerging markets is for slightly less-strong growth than used to be the case . <p> 6 . Europe continues to waver <p> Much longer term , there is a growing sense that analysts were wrong to believe that the ticking time-bomb under the European project had been defused . While periphery countries such as Greece are no longer facing the prospect of imminent collapse , the spotlight has moved to much larger , supposedly too-big-to-fail economies . <p> France and Italy in particular are under the spotlight : it is hard to see either nation ever getting its act together . France is facing an intractable political crisis , with the demagogic Marine Le Pen rising seemingly unstoppably in the opinion polls . Where that leads is anybody 's guess . <p> 7 . Middle East conflict <p> Last but not least , the conflict in the Middle East is making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are pricing in a greater chance of terrorism and chaos . <p> That is hardly the main , or even a central reason for the slump in stock markets , but it certainly is n't helping sentiment . The second phase of the post-crisis recovery is well and truly over .

Isolated up front with no direct wingers to feed him deliveries or cut-backs he found himself dazed and confused and then insurmountably incapable of fending for himself . <p> I could n't define him as a player in Lilywhite and he is most definitely not the same technically ruthless individual that scored with comparative ease for Valencia .

Build up play and linking with team-mates might be equally important to aid the fluidity of the team as we move to a certified style but supporters will not concern themselves with anything other than what the priority expectation is from a player .

@@2864238 <p> Books beget books and this engrossing , wide-ranging study of the deeply prejudicial mythology surrounding matters Chinese arose from a conversation between Christopher Frayling , polymathic emeritus professor of cultural history at the Royal College of Art and former rector of the RCA , and Edward Said , the Palestinian-American critic and historian . In 1995 , during the course of a BBC radio discussion on the " cinema of empire " , Frayling raised two questions about Orientalism , Said 's seminal study that challenged the patronising attitude of western observers to Asian art . First , why did Said neglect the influence of popular culture in shaping prejudices and reinforcing stereotypes ? Second , why had he said so little directly about China ? With characteristic grace , Said accepted both charges and suggested Frayling undertake a job for which he had been informally preparing . His passion had begun in his public school library in the 1950s , relishing pulp novels about the ingeniously cruel , oriental super-criminal Fu Manchu , and had continued in 1970 when he met the widow of Fu 's creator , Sax Rohmer , while planning a student send-up of Rohmer 's work at Cambridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ images , he admits early on that " at one level , this book is a kind of exorcism " . Fortunately , Frayling can criticise and contextualise the world from which Fu Manchu emerged without either letting go of that youthful excitement that attracted him in the first place or denying the literary equivalent of No ? l Coward 's famous tribute in Private Lives to the potency of cheap music . Coward wrote that line , incidentally , in 1930 while convalescing from influenza in Shanghai , one of Fu Manchu 's stamping grounds , the same year the first sound movie featuring Fu opened at Grauman 's Chinese theatre in Los Angeles . <p> In the 18th century , the British view of China was generally admiring and benign . But as Frayling demonstrates , the change over the next hundred years was steady and dramatic . The British imperialists conducted a series of wars to impose the opium trade on China and suppressed the Boxer rebellion that was the natural response to this brutal commerce . Paradoxically , the oppressive foreigners managed to cast the oppressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting with Coleridge and De Quincy , European writers created a cult around opium and the frighteningly exotic oriental dreams it unleashed , a movement that reached its literary peak in Dickens 's The Mystery of Edwin Droodand Wilde 's Dorian Gray . By the end of the century , Chinatown and its notorious opium dens had become the locus of dangerous romance , alluring evil and spine-tingling threat in Europe and North America , with London 's Limehouse a top attraction for the intrepid tourist . <p> The general drift was encouraged by bestselling books in which missionaries and old China hands shared their ignorance with western readers and apocalyptic novels of a sort still echoed in reputable books on the prospects for future role of China on the global scene . The new century opened with the first reference , in the Daily News of 21 July 1900 , to " the yellow peril in its most serious form " .

The resonant name came from the Saxon and roughly translates as " blade roamer " and might well have inspired the unfilmed William Burroughs screenplay Blade Runner from which the Ridley Scott sci-fi picture took its name . <p> While working early in the 20th century at the London branch of the Hong Kong and Shanghai bank ( where PG Wodehouse was a fellow clerk ) , he began freelance writing for the popular press before composing songs and sketches for the music hall , most notably for the comedians George Robey and Little Tich . As a journalist , he became a bogus authority on Limehouse and the Chinese community and he claimed to have seen a strikingly tall and sinister Chinaman there one night , the way his contemporary Baroness Orczy had a vision of the Scarlet Pimpernel one day at an underground station . He had great respect for the Chinese , particularly their poise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fu Manchu was a product of the times , filtered through the music hall -- a place charged with jingoism and xenophobic humour , employing Asian magicians and other entertainers and staging pantomimes and musicals featuring oriental villains . Moreover , the central characters of Rohmer 's Fu Manchu stories , the first of which appeared in 1913 , the last in the 1950s , found their models in the work of Conan Doyle : the suburban narrator Dr Petrie , the Scotland Yard detective Nayland Smith and Dr Fu himself paralleling Watson , Holmes and Moriarty . <p> The Fu Manchu books achieved immediate success , and the garish covers of the paperbacks and the movie posters ( reproduced in The Yellow Peril in all their pulp glory ) were a major contribution to the popular image of the exotic Orient .

But an important part of his success was that while his organisation operated everywhere from Hong Kong to Limehouse , no one was sure for whom he actually worked . Was it the old Manchu dynasty or the Young China Movement , his own evil ends or a resurgent world-threatening Asia ? <p> Impersonated by a charismatic Boris Karloff in the MGM B-feature The Mask of Fu Manchu ( 1932 ) , a camp classic widely regarded as the best movie in the series , his aim was to destroy the white race using the sword and mask of Genghis Khan . The Chinese consul in Los Angeles protested and the film has since existed uneasily in the realm of guilty pleasure . In the 1930s , however , the Chinese government was less concerned with Fu than with overseeing the positive images of Chinese projected in prestige Hollywood versions of novels by the Nobel prize-winner Pearl S Buck . <p> The Mask comes across as funny , dated , curiously innocent -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain there was for several years a serious version of Fu broadcast nightly by BBC radio for an audience of millions of impressionable young listeners -- Li-Chang , the Chinese villain in Dick Barton -- Special Agent . In the 1950s , however , the story of Fu ended up as camp , self-mocking , post-imperial nostalgia in the BBC radio comedy The Goon Show , written and performed by that Irish child of the empire Spike Milligan and his co-star Peter Sellers . Appropriately , in The Fiendish Plot of Dr Fu Manchu ( 1980 ) , the abysmal comic pastiche that brought an end to the devil Doctor 's screen career , Sellers played both Fu Manchu and his western nemesis , Nayland Smith , and died before the film opened .

Parker played with Australian trio the Necks , maestros of the art who share his commitment to a many-layered polyphonic improv . It was a fascinating , delicately nuanced and heartwarming display of give and take . Parker often allowed his long soliloquies to be buffeted and spun by the Necks ' famous ebbs and surges of collective sound , but he sometimes intervened , drawing the music out of trance states into more restless episodes . <p> Where the Necks choose to begin has a pervasive impact on the run of play -- it might be a rocket launch of percussion noise from Tony Buck , a double-bass murmur that slowly becomes a hook , or a looping piano figure from Chris Abrahams . The bass method opened this show , with Lloyd Swanton 's quiet proddings initially inviting something close to conventionally lyrical melody from Parker 's soprano sax . Richly woven sax patterns unfolded over Abrahams 's percussive piano , and when the pianist switched to brighter , pearly trills , Parker emitted fraught , exclamatory yelps .

@@2898231 to improve the scalability , flexibility of its cloud <p> BMW is using OpenStack to stand up its private cloud platform in a bid to improve the scalability and flexibility of the company 's IT infrastructure , but according to Dr. Stefan Lenz , the company 's IT infrastructure , department manager datacentre , the open source project still needs to become more hardened in order to support a greater variety of workloads and use cases . <p> Lenz , who was speaking at the OpenStack Summit in Paris Monday , said that the company has between 60 and 80 per cent of its infrastructure virtualised , and about 98 per cent of the company 's servers worldwide , which are spread over four datacentres , are centrally managed from its operations department in Munich . <p> " We standardised our infrastructure brutally , and because of this we are 25 per cent more cost-efficient than our competitors in delivering infrastructure services , " Lenz said . " But three years ago , the path of standardisation of automation on a conventional level reached its peak . We could not become more cost-efficient with conventional methods . So in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one framework . " <p> The company initially developed its own platform internally , a modular private cloud platform to support its database environment , control systems and other mission-critical applications . But Lenz told BCN that the platform eventually ran into some issues -- applications would n't always work as planned depending on the operating environment , and creating standards within the underlying framework was a challenge . <p> Lenz said that after sitting through numerous management meetings with internal staff who suggested OpenStack could be one way to solve some of these persistent issues ( the company also considered Cloud Stack ) , he decided to try the platform out on a spare server kicking around one of its datacentres , which was a success . <p> " After the sandbox experiment we decided to build a semi-productive environment -- we work with it in developing our own datacentre method , and we work with it to give certain user groups access to the cloud environment so they can use it for developing their own applications and interfaces .

" <p> It also delivers on availability , which is crucial for BMW . Lenz said that every 60 seconds the infrastructure is down , a car does n't get built . And while the company has n't yet put highly productive workloads on it just yet , he says that 's likely to change by early next year , with a view towards having most systems running on OpenStack in the next three years . <p> All of the company 's SAP and database environments are built to work on Suse Linux @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained that more work needs to go into making OpenStack more stable in order to improve confidence in running the platform at scale , a theme that has become more prominent over the past few months . <p> Most OpenStack deployments are indeed fairly small , either experimental or limited to local clusters so deep experience with large scale deployments is sparse , though this is slowly changing . <p> He said one of the big challenges when using OpenStack is ( still ) identity federation , a gap CERN and Rackspace among others are working to plug , and DNS service integration is essential if BMW is going to shift more workloads onto OpenStack . <p> " The thing that bothers us most currently is the release cycles .

@@2898237 <h> ' I came to the UK and I was turned into a prostitute ' -- trafficked women share their horrific stories <p> When trafficked women finally break free of their abusers , they turn in desperation to the authorities . This is only the start of a new nightmare . Four women describe their slavery , escape and further detention by officials they thought would help them <p> Last year Theresa May announced new legislation to end human trafficking and modern slavery , describing it as the " evil in our midst " . Figures from the National Crime Agency in September estimated that 2,744 people , including 602 children , were trafficked for exploitation in the UK in 2013 , a 22% increase on 2012 , and forced to work in brothels , in domestic servitude , or exploited in factories , farms and building sites . Since this is such a hidden issue , the actual numbers are assumed to be much higher . <p> On Tuesday , parliament will scrutinise the modern slavery bill for its third reading in the House of Commons . Although the bill -- which the government trumpets as " the first of its kind in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to the political agenda , there is dismay from charities working with the victims of trafficking . Campaigners say the bill is tilted too heavily towards prosecuting traffickers , without providing enough support for their victims . <p> The charity Eaves , which runs the Poppy Project to support trafficked women , is concerned that the bill wo n't end the double trauma that most trafficking victims currently face . Dorcas Erskine , who works for the Poppy Project , says : " A lot of the women we have supported face two nightmares -- the brutality of the slavery-like conditions their traffickers have imposed on them , and , post-escape , getting officials to believe them or , even worse , finding themselves imprisoned for crimes their traffickers forced them to commit . " Because of this lack of support , very few of the women Eaves helps are willing to get involved in prosecuting their traffickers , and many remain vulnerable , often ending up in the hands of new exploiters . <p> The stories of four recently trafficked women reveal how frequently they are disbelieved . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is the worst part of it ' <p> When Ellie , 32 , describes the first part of her life , she races through the disturbing details in a neutral tone ; the problems she experienced as a child and a young woman are not what makes her angry . She grew up in a slum outside Kampala in Uganda . She was sent to live with another family when she was seven and sexually abused by the head of the household ; when she turned 15 , she was forced to marry him . He was violent , so when a neighbour offered to help her escape to a new life abroad , she agreed . <p> She was taken by plane to the UK with a group of six other women . Ellie thought that she was going to work as a cleaner , but on the day she arrived , she was driven to the home of a white man who told her she would have to work as a prostitute to pay back her debts for the passport and air travel . For two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and periodically driven to customers ' homes . <p> She only escaped when a sympathetic client gave her ? 60 and explained how to get to London . In London , she met a man who allowed her to stay with him , but who quickly began to ask for sex in exchange for shelter . One night when he was violently abusive , she called the police . <p> This is the moment , in a life story of unmitigated misfortune , when you might expect that things would begin to improve . However , it marked the beginning of a new wave of difficulty , and this is where she begins to get angry . She was taken to hospital , but not treated ; later the police took her to a police station , where she was fingerprinted and told she had no visa . Since she had only been given a passport to hold for a few seconds when she passed border control at the airport , she knew nothing about visas . <p> " They were asking each other : ' Did she come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking was very intimidating . They did n't ask about the attack . They were more interested in why I was staying in the country without a visa . " The man who hit her was not arrested , but she was taken to Yarl 's Wood detention centre . " I 'd never been in detention before . It felt like a prison : being locked up , eating your food at certain times , sleeping at certain times . Most of the time you ca n't go outside ; you can barely see daylight . " <p> The other inmates laughed at her when they found out she had called the police , and told her she was stupid to have expected them to help her . She was quickly put on suicide watch because she told staff that she would kill herself rather than be deported back to a country where she would be in danger from her husband and her traffickers . " They would n't let me buy tinned food in case I took the tin and cut myself ; they watched me while I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For a while she regretted having escaped from her trafficker , and thought returning to her existence as a sex slave might be preferable . <p> It was only when she was in Yarl 's Wood that she realised she had been trafficked . " So many of the women I met in detention had been trafficked . I do n't think the police who interviewed me knew about trafficking . They were more interested in catching someone for being an illegal migrant than in helping someone who has called for help . All they were talking about was deporting me , " she says . <p> It was only when a sympathetic guard suggested that she put her name down for legal aid that she was put in touch with Eaves . Her asylum claim on the grounds of trafficking was rejected initially , but with Eaves ' help , this was overturned . <p> She wishes there was greater awareness of trafficking throughout the system . If border staff had been on the lookout for people-trafficking when she arrived in the UK , she would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had stopped me on the border , I would have been so much happier ; I would n't have done all the bad things that I was made to do . But I came here and I was turned into a prostitute . " <p> She is calm when we speak ; very articulate and very angry about what has happened to her . " Putting trafficked people in prison -- that is the worst part of it . You have gone through bad times , and then you find yourself in detention , told you are going to be deported back to the traffickers . That man is still there and he is still bringing in women . That 's why I 'm so upset . " <h> Varsha : ' I 'm scared they will come and take me and send me to my country ' <p> Varsha , 22 , grew up in Albania , her childhood overshadowed by a violent father who arranged for her to get married when she was 19 to a man she did n't know . The wedding went ahead ; her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved into her in-laws ' home , where she was bullied and unhappy . She met a young man through a friend on her hairdressing course . He told her how sorry he felt for her and , after a while , she agreed to run away with him to live abroad . <p> He brought her to the UK , where he left her with two Albanian men . She never saw him again . She was told that from now on , she would be working for them as a prostitute . When she screamed and protested , one of the men took off his belt and beat her . She was locked in the flat , given meals twice a day , raped and beaten repeatedly . On average , she was forced to have sex with five men a day . She was told that if she tried to escape , the traffickers would find her and kill her or her family . <p> One day , however , she found the doors unlocked , and she escaped . She got to a coach station ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Liverpool ) and got on a bus to London . She was wearing only slippers and was in the early stages of pregnancy . Two women from Kosovo saw her crying and offered her a place to stay in London , but this place was only temporary . She had no passport , because it remained with the traffickers . <p> " I was scared to go to the authorities , I was scared that they would send me back to my country , " she says . When she did tell the Home Office about her experiences , she was struck by their insensitivity . " They seemed as though they were in a hurry , they were just doing their job , they had heard this story too many times before . " <p> She was interviewed by the Home Office about her trafficking experiences , but her application for asylum was rejected in 2012 . " They said in some points , I was n't believable . You want to be believed . You hope other people will believe you . " <p> It was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the judge believed her and her application was accepted . " I 've told my story maybe 10 times , 15 times -- in hospital , in council offices , to the Home Office . It 's not nice .

I hate being reminded every time of what happened to me . <p> " I 'm scared every day that they will come and take me and send me to my country . I 'm scared at the idea of prosecuting those men . I 'm scared for my child . " <p> Her asylum claim was accepted in July 2013 . " That felt good , but it was just the beginning of other problems , " she says .

Victims are being recycled back into the trafficking system . " <p> Varsha thinks it would be a good idea if there was counselling for victims of trafficking , something that is not proposed under the bill . " Every day I was crying , wondering what was going to happen to me , wondering what I was doing . It has been two years now . I 'm learning how to protect myself a bit . It is just the beginning for me . But I 'm still scared . Last Friday , I heard a woman screaming near my house . I was scared when I heard her voice . She was being beaten . " <h> Eleni : I tried to tell them about the exploitation , but they did n't want to listen ' <p> When she was 16 , Elena 's father was imprisoned without trial because he supported a banned political party in Ethiopia . An uncle arranged for her to leave the country and travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her she would be safe ; he paid traffickers to organise a passport and find her work . She was employed by a couple to look after their children , cook and clean . She was n't ever paid ; sometimes she was raped by her employer ; sometimes his wife hit her for failing to complete her work . <p> Periodically , the family moved to Europe for a few months , where she continued to work for them , sleeping in the kitchen . When they told her they planned to return home and send her back to Ethiopia , she was frightened that she would be imprisoned there , just as her father had been . She chose a moment when her employers were distracted and fled the house . <p> " I did n't know where I was going , I just left , " Eleni , now 24 , says . She ran and then walked for a long time , until she was tired . When she was resting on a park bench , crying , a man stopped and asked if she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she made him understand enough of her situation to make him concerned . He put her in a taxi and paid the driver to take her to a police station . Police officers were sympathetic , found her a hostel to stay in and returned with an interpreter the following day to interview her about what had happened . <p> For several weeks , she was left in the hostel while the police decided what to do with her . Then one morning , at around 5am when she was asleep , officers knocked on the door , unlocked it themselves and told her they were sending her to London . She cries when she remembers the shock of the visit . She asked if she could get dressed before they took her ; they agreed but would n't let her close the door . <p> She was sent to Yarl 's Wood detention centre and remained there for three months . " When I was there , I asked what crime I had committed . They told me that my visa had expired . I told them my passport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . They said : ' You are not a child ; you should be able to carry your own passport . ' I tried to tell them my story , about the exploitation , but they did n't want to listen . It was as if they had heard it all before . I escaped from my employers hoping to get some help . I expected the police to help me but my experience was really bad . " <p> She was released with the help of the Poppy Project . " I am very angry and very scared when I think about all the things I went through . I was relatively healthy when I went in , but I became ill quickly because of the stress of being locked up . It was only when I had an interview that I managed to ask through an interpreter why I was there . It was only when I was referred to Poppy that I understood what trafficking was . " <h> Hamida : ' All the suffering I have been through still has n't ended ' <p> Hamida @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has only recently extracted herself from the trafficking system and is barely ready to start recounting her experiences . <p> She was one of nine children , and with both her parents out of work , there was little money at home in Morocco , so she was sent to be a domestic worker in the UK . Her future employer filled out the passport and visa application for her , and kept hold of her passport . She worked seven days a week and was frequently not paid ; her English employers were physically and verbally abusive . She wanted to return home but her employers told her that if she tried to leave , they would report her to the police for theft . <p> After 18 months , she fled the house , took advice from a Moroccan woman whom she met in a cafe , and went to seek help from the police . Police officers organised a telephone translator for her and for a moment she thought she might get some help , but the call was very brief , then she was told : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " They did n't listen to what I was telling them , " she says . They called her employers , who brought in her passport . " They looked at the visa stamp and said it had run out . " She was put in a police cell in Hastings for 24 hours . " I was crying in the police station , I was very frightened . " Police officers arranged for her to have another telephone conversation with an interpreter . " The interpreter said : ' What have you done , my daughter ? ' I said : ' I have n't done anything wrong . ' He said : ' Hopefully God will look after you . ' " <p> She was transferred to Yarl 's Wood , where she was held for 19 days . Fellow detainees , more experienced in the British system , were incredulous when they heard that she had gone to the police station . She had felt confident that it was the right thing to do . " I thought : this is a country of law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> She is so fond of the child she looked after for 18 months that she feels ambivalent about any possible prosecution of the parents , her ex-employers . " All this suffering I have been going through , with the police and with my employers , it still has n't ended . I feel scared whenever I see the police , I feel worried even when I see someone wearing a suit . " <p> Poppy staff say she has flashbacks and panic attacks and cries frequently . She is attending English classes while a legal case to show that she was the victim of trafficking proceeds , but she finds studying difficult . " I am very frightened . It 's deep inside me . It 's hard to concentrate on the classes . "

@@2909233 <p> At the very moment of its ultimate triumph , capitalism will experience the most exquisite of deaths . <p> This is the belief of political adviser and author Jeremy Rifkin , who argues the current economic system has become so successful at lowering the costs of production that it has created the very conditions for the destruction of the traditional vertically integrated corporation . <p> Rifkin , who has advised the European Commission , the European Parliament and heads of state , including German chancellor Angela Merkel , says : <p> No one in their wildest imagination , including economists and business people , ever imagined the possibility of a technology revolution so extreme in its productivity that it could actually reduce marginal costs to near zero , making products nearly free , abundant and absolutely no longer subject to market forces . <p> With many manufacturing companies surviving only on razor thin margins , they will buckle under competition from small operators with virtually no fixed costs . <p> " We are seeing the final triumph of capitalism followed by its exit off the world stage and the entrance of the collaborative commons , " Rifkin predicts . <p> The creation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic system , he believes , will emerge a radical new model powered by the extraordinary pace of innovation in energy , communication and transport . <p> " This is the first new economic system since the advent of capitalism and socialism in the early 19th century so it 's a remarkable historical event and it 's going to transform our way of life fundamentally over the coming years , " Rifkin says . " It already is ; we just have n't framed it . " <p> Some sectors , such as music and media , have already been disrupted as a result of the internet 's ability to let individuals and small groups compete with the major established players . Meanwhile , the mainstreaming of 3D printing and tech advances in logistics -- such as the installation of billions of intelligent sensors across supply chains -- means this phenomenon is now spreading from the virtual to the physical world , Rifkin says . <p> Climate change <p> The creation of a new economic system , Rifkin argues , will help alleviate key sustainability challenges , such as climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural world .

" We could lose 70% of our species by the end of this century and may be imperilling our ability to survive on this planet . " <p> Convergence of communication , energy and transport <p> Every economy in history has relied for its success on the three pillars of communication , energy , and transportation , but what Rifkin says makes this age unique is that we are seeing them converge to create a super internet . <p> While the radical changes in communication are already well known , he claims a revolution in transport is just around the corner . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of printed out cars within 10 or 15 years , " he says . " Add to this GPS guidance and driverless vehicles and you will see the marginal costs of transport on this automated logistics internet falling pretty sharply .

Rifkin predicts the cost of harvesting energy will one day be as cheap as buying a phone : <p> You can create your own green electricity and then go up on the emerging energy internet and programme your apps to share your surpluses across that energy internet .

Almost exactly a year previously , the Blades ' Georges Santos -- never the most shrinking of violets and a former West Brom player -- had come off worse in a challenge with the midfielder Andy Johnson , then of Nottingham Forest .

Red card , box ticked , can we get on with the game now ? <p> For a while the players did . Dobie , enjoying the best season of his career , headed the visitors in front shortly after Tracey 's dismissal . West Brom , who arrived in third place to United 's 15th , controlled proceedings thereafter and doubled their lead on 63 minutes with a thunderbolt from Derek McInnes . <p> Many games would simply play themselves out from hereon but Warnock decided to roll up United 's collective sleeves .

Santos had anticipated it and , given the speed at which he was hurtling towards ball and destination , the challenge looked a 50-50 one -- but the result was violent . There was , at least , time to brace yourself for the crunch as Santos flung himself high above the ball , sent Johnson flying even higher into the air and lit the spark that unleashed hell . <p> He was sent off within seconds .

Nick Ames <h> 2 ) Fulham v Watford ( July 2004 ) <p> A football match that lasted 90 minutes despite being abandoned at half-time . Surely some mistake , eh ? Nope , this farce actually unfolded . To celebrate their return to a refurbished 22,000 all-seater Craven Cottage for the 2004-05 season after a two-year absence in which they 'd metaphorically kipped on QPR 's Loftus Road sofa , Fulham arranged a pre-season friendly with Watford in order to acclimatise players and fans with their spruced-up new digs . <p> With Fifa having capped the number of substitutions allowed per team in friendly matches to six in the wake of widespread grumbling about the number of changes being made in international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ match referee , Peter Walton , refused to sanction any more than six changes per team , despite the patently unfit players on show having only just returned from their holidays , having clearly summered very well . Rather than break with Fifa protocol in a match that was little more than a glorified kick-about , Walton abandoned the match at half-time and left the ground , prompting Fulham manager Chris Coleman and his Watford counterpart Ray Lewington to agree to continue the match as an exhibition with a linesman acting as benevolent referee who would let them make as many substitutions as they liked . <p> " There has to be common sense really , " said Lewington . " To ask players to play 90 minutes so early is ridiculous . " The Fulham club secretary , Lee Hoos , agreed , stating that limiting the number of substitutions in a game so early in pre-season imposed " a significant health and safety risk on players who have been back in training for one week to have to play 90 minutes " . A full 45 minutes ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the referee , more than 18 subs had been used in a match that petered out into an oft-interrupted and presumably dreary scoreless draw . Barry Glendenning <p> Question : where was former West Ham manager Harry Redknapp when the lights went out ? Answer : in the dark . On 3 November 1997 , almost 17 years ago to the day , Harry 's Hammers entertained Crystal Palace in a televised Monday night Premier League match at the Boleyn Ground . With Palace leading 2-1 , courtesy of a brace from Neil Shipperley , Frank Lampard scored an equaliser for West Ham in the 65th minute , apparently striking the ball with such venom that it prompted the floodlights to go out , shrouding the ground in darkness . <p> The stadium sparks were called into action and managed to illuminate proceedings once again -- but only briefly . Seconds later the lights went out again , forcing the referee , David Elleray , to abandon the match , which was replayed the following month and won 4-1 by West Ham . It was not the first time a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nor would it be the last . <p> Three months previously , Derby County suffered the humiliation of having their much-trumpeted maiden league match at Pride Park abandoned when the lights went out 11 minutes into the second half , as they led Wimbledon . " We had 11 maintenance people on duty , including six electricians , but nobody has yet worked out why both generators failed , " said club official Peter Gadsby , shortly after the match referee , Uriah Rennie , was forced to call proceedings to a premature halt . At the time the incident was chalked down to teething problems at a new ground and little more was said about it . <p> If having football matches abandoned because of floodlight failure at two Premier League grounds smacks of carelessness , then having three abandonments in the space of five months positively reeks of foul play , so when the match referee , Dermot Gallagher , was forced to send players and fans home early after the bulbs shut down at Selhurst Park during the second half of a scoreless match between Wimbledon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the festive night air was overwhelming . " Once was bad enough , the second was n't pretty and this is getting near a disaster , " said the former Wimbledon owner Sam Hammam . " Unless we stop it , there will be shame on the game . We are all embarrassed by it . " <p> With police as mystified by what was going on as they were suspicious , it was not until 15 months later that the reasons for two of these impromptu spells of darkness came to ... er , light . As suspected , it was in fact a betting syndicate rather than dodgy electrics that was responsible for the floodlight failures at the Boleyn Ground and Selhurst Park . While bets on football matches that end prematurely are generally voided in the UK , in the far east , where illegal betting on English football is a ridiculously huge industry , wagers are settled on the " result " at half-time if the match is abandoned after the interval . Having successfully landed themselves bumper pay-outs by switching off the lights with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scoreline was in their favour , two years later the ne'er-do-wells responsible attempted to repeat the stunt at Charlton Athletic . <p> Having offered Roger Firth , who was at the time a security supervisor at The Valley , the sum of ? 20,000 to grant them access to the ground 's floodlights in order to fit a remote control gizmo that would enable them to shut down the floodlights during a February fixture between Charlton and Liverpool , Wai Yuen Liu , a native of Hong Kong who held a British passport and was a long-time resident of London , and two Malaysian associates , Eng Hwa Lim and Chee Kew Ong , were foiled when their inside man offered a colleague ? 5,000 to keep watch while the lights were being nobbled . Firth 's colleague alerted the police , whose subsequent investigation revealed that the three Asian gamblers had engineered the blackouts at the Boleyn Ground and Selhurst Park in 1997 . No evidence was uncovered to suggest the rogue gamblers were responsible for the lights going out at Pride Park . <p> Upon being charged with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounding accusation considering the immense damage they could have done to what passes for the integrity of English football , Firth , Lim and Ong all pleaded guilty . Charlton Athletic 's former employee got 18 months in prison for his troubles , while the Malaysians who turned his head got four years each . <p> A heavy gambler who was up to his eyes in debt and had lost ? 120,000 over two years in west London 's Golden Horseshoe casino , Liu denied involvement , despite being arrested in a police sting at The Valley on the day he his associates turned up to install their circuit breaker . He was found guilty at Middlesex crown court and received a 30-month sentence for his role in a scam that allegedly netted far eastern organised crime gangs up to ? 60m .

It was Easter Saturday and the Latics travelled to staunchly mid-table Middlesbrough for a match that they quite fancied could help them steal a march on leaders Manchester City . In common with almost everyone in a league whose figures halfway resemble those of the 2013 Nigerian Premier League , their away record was in negative figures and a trip to Ayresome Park did not exactly seem foil-wrapped by the Easter bunny even if Boro had lost 5-1 in the side 's first meeting of the season . The weather was characteristically gloomy , damp and windy and the 7,000 home fans were perfectly used to receiving visitors who did not really fancy the fight . <p> It seemed that way once more after 20 minutes when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back but the atmosphere was not at all good : the referee , a Mr H Smith from Nottingham , had made a number of decisions that appeared to favour the hosts and Oldham 's players , who included a gnarled 32-year-old left-back named Billy Cook , began to simmer . <p> As the match approached the hour mark , with Oldham still making a go of things , Middlesbrough won a penalty after a foul by Cook , who was well-known for taking few prisoners . Four-one , game over in a division that was not known for its astonishing comebacks . <p> There 's no about-face here , no carpet pulled from under the feet : it did remain 4-1 -- but the fun had only just begun . Three minutes after the penalty , Cook made another late challenge and that , for Mr Smith , was that -- the serial miscreant was expelled from the pitch . Oldham were outraged : they surrounded the official and Cook , meanwhile , did not have the look of a man who planned to go anywhere fast . Mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gargantuan percentage of games in the modern era -- whipped out a watch and give him a minute to head to the bath . <p> Cook did not . So Mr Smith did .

It had all been done very primly but that was match over . <p> Not so prim was the scene in the stands , where the supporters wanted their remaining 30 minutes or so but they were not given it , and instead the result was later allowed to stand . On account of " misconduct on the field and gross misconduct in refusing to leave the ground when ordered by the referee " , Cook was suspended from football for a year that would not , in any case , be seen out because of the first world war and Oldham were fined ? 350 . If they had won the game , they would eventually have won the league @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is best , and perhaps only , recalled for Cook 's moment of bolshiness . NA <h> 5 ) Colchester United v Reading ( November 1948 ) <p> The abandonment of football matches because of poor weather conditions is nothing out of the ordinary , although the decision to end Colchester United 's and Reading 's FA Cup first-round match as a consequence of thick fog after only 35 minutes seems particularly poignant . A non-league side made up of various professionals attempting to get back in the game after the war years , Southern League side Colchester had enjoyed a fine Cup run the previous season , beating local rivals Chelmsford City , Banbury Spencer , Wrexham , Huddersfield and Bradford Park Avenue , before losing at the hands of Blackpool . With hopes high that their club might emulate or even better the previous season 's success , a crowd of 19,072 piled into Layer Road to see the Essex side take on Reading , who would go on to top the Third Division that season , in the first round . With the fog impenetrable , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subsequent replay 4-2 .

BG <p> Football 's a funny old game , Jimmy Greaves has been known to opine . It 's rarely funnier than when matches played in South America end in the kind of heroically violent cartoon brawls of the sort that would prompt mass hand-wringing , parliamentary questions and swift police action were they to occur closer to home . It seems distance makes the laughter grow louder , so the kind of regular violence that would almost certainly make po-faced news headlines were it to take place in an English league match is instead relegated to the " and finally , here 's a good one ...

The closing scenes of the match between Paraguayan teams Teniente Fari ? a and Libertad were deemed the pick of a very big bunch from a genre that appears to throw up a new example every couple of weeks . <p> Having sent off one player from each team for fighting in the closing minutes of this junior league match in Caacupe , the referee , Nestor Guillen , could have been forgiven for presuming he 'd ended the scrap in question and restored order . Unfortunately for him , the players involved refused to adjourn to the dressing room and continued swinging haymakers at each other on the pitch , where they were soon joined by assorted team-mates and the occupants of both benches in a frenzy of punching , shoving and high-kicking so widespread that the sole cameraman present was unable to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be futile and the best course of action was to flee the scene instead , the referee , along with his officials , did exactly that , abandoning the match and leaving the brawlers to their own violent devices . In his subsequent report , Guillen said he 'd red-carded every player and substitute involved , 36 in total , much to the displeasure of officials from both teams . <p> " Many of the players that were on the field and on the substitutes ' bench , everyone went on to the field to try to control their team-mates and even the players from the other team , " said the Teniente Fari ? a president , Hernan Martinez , whose understanding of the word " control " seems sketchy at best . " The referees did n't even stay on the field . As soon as the fighting broke out they went to the dressing room . They ran through the tunnel to their dressing room . They were n't able to see anything that happened . But in the report , to more or less wash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players . " <p> Martinez 's Libertad counterpart , Sixto Nu ? ez , concurred . " The referee needed to take better care of the boys , " he said . " He should have made sure that the two dismissed players were completely off the field . Instead , the officials left the field and when the players were all leaving together that 's when the fighting started again . " <p> Remarkably , this was n't the first time a referee " sent off " 36 people in one match , with referee Damian Rubino having served a mixture of players , subs and coaches with the same number after he abandoned an Argentinian fifth-tier match between Claypole and Victoriano Arenas that erupted in violence back in March 2011 . " Most players were trying to separate people , " said the Claypole manager , Sergio Micielli . " The ref was confused . " BG

There are now about 100 million Christians in the world 's most populous nation , eclipsing the 86.7 million-strong membership of the ruling Communist party . According to western intellectual tradition , modernity is supposed to bring secularisation but in modern Communist China it has been accompanied by an extraordinary rise of religions formerly banned as " opiates of the masses " . <p> Perhaps most surprising , given its status as a " foreign " religion and its close association with an earlier era of gunboats and imperialism , Christianity ( particularly the Protestant variety ) has been the big winner in the competition for Chinese souls .

This has included harassment , detentions , removing crosses and destroying churches in Wenzhou and throughout Zhejiang Province .

Until recently , one of the most striking things about the city was the abundance of giant ornate cathedrals and huge neon-lit crosses dotted around town and the surrounding countryside . Local church groups estimate at least 10 per cent of Wenzhou 's population -- more than 1.2 million people -- attends a Protestant congregation regularly . Just as in the rest of China , the Catholic population is much smaller but still numbers in the hundreds of thousands . They have also been subject to forced cross removals , harassment , increased surveillance and detentions for " illegal " worship this year . <p> Freedom of religion is technically guaranteed under China 's constitution but , in practice , all religious organisations must be approved by the government and their activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visitors notice about officially sanctioned churches in China are the police security cameras conspicuously located inside to keep watch on preachers and their congregations while they worship .

This often makes government crackdowns ineffective or even self-defeating .

Morrison 's other job as a translator for the British East India Company would prove emblematic of the close association between Christianity and the humiliations imposed on China in the opium wars and other foreign incursions . In many of the " unequal treaties " that ceded territory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clauses were included to guarantee missionary 's access to Chinese souls . Even with this help , Protestant missionaries were not particularly successful . After 27 years of missionary work in China , Morrison could take credit for just 25 converts and , even by 1900 , after nearly a century of efforts by thousands of missionaries , the number of Chinese Protestants was barely 100,000 . <p> When the Communists won their revolution in 1949 there were about 800,000 Protestants , compared with some three million Catholics in a country of 540 million people . In 2010 , the Pew Research Center estimated there were about nine million Catholics and more than 58 million Protestants in China . Using a conservative annual growth rate of 10 per cent , Professor Yang and others estimate the total number of Christians in China is now about 100 million .

" Catholicism is based much more on clerical power so believers feel less responsible for the growth of the community , whereas Protestantism is more entrepreneurial , it provides more freedom and power to the faithful and church groups can be started by anyone .

" I started going to church when I moved to Beijing and I feel like it provides a moral foundation in a messy and corrupt modern society and helps cultivate a sense of self-respect . " Both Han and Wang say they feel Catholicism is stricter and more serious than Protestantism , which is more popular and tends to attract younger people who do n't necessarily have a family history of Christian faith . This flexibility of Protestantism also leaves a lot of room for individual interpretation . So it is no surprise most of China 's many heterodox movements and cults tend to grow out of the charismatic fringes of the underground Protestant churches . <p> ? . ? . ? . ? <p> In mid-October , Zhang Fan , 29 , and her father Zhang Lidong , 55 , were sentenced to death for the brutal murder of a woman in a McDonald 's outlet in eastern China after their victim refused to join them in worshipping the " Church of Almighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes by the name " Eastern Lightning " , claims millions of followers who all believe Jesus has already come back to earth as a Chinese woman and lived in central China until recently .

The whole country was shocked in May when a cellphone video circulated online showing the Zhangs and four others , including a 12-year-old , beating the woman to death with a chair and a pole while other customers watched or fled . In response , the government launched a nationwide crackdown on the group and paraded Zhang Lidong on state television , where he admitted his crime and pleaded self defence , saying the woman was a " demon " that attacked him with supernatural powers . <p> Of the 14 cults Beijing placed on a watch list in 2009 , 12 of them were based on some form of Christianity .

Qiu Zhonghui , vice-chairman of the Amity Foundation , explains why the government decided to allow the venture to open in 1987 to print a book , which was banned and burned for decades under communism .

Christopher Turner puts on his plastic gloves to examine treasures from the Institute of Sexology , and finds that the pioneers of the study of sex were not just campaigners but political activists and collectors , too <p> ' Berlin is a bugger 's daydream , " the 21-year-old WH Auden wrote to Christopher Isherwood , with news of the city 's 170 police-controlled male brothels . By 1929 , when his school friend joined him there , the metropolis was the world capital of sexual liberation with a decade-long reputation as " Babylon on the Spree " . In his 1939 novel , Goodbye to Berlin , Isherwood brilliantly captured the Weimar Republic 's decadent atmosphere of sexual experimentation , which was heightened by a sense of looming crisis . The city had been hit particularly hard by the worldwide recession ; there was mass unemployment , malnutrition , economic panic and simmering political violence . " One suddenly realised the whole foundations of life were shaking , " Auden concluded . <p> In Berlin , Isherwood lived in an apartment owned by Magnus Hirschfeld 's Institute for Sexual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French ambassador . The institute was decorated more like a wealthy private residence than a scientific establishment , with Persian carpets , a grand piano and glass cabinets full of porcelain . Free sex advice was dispensed in lectures and private consulting rooms and there were medical clinics for the treatment of venereal diseases and other sexual problems , as well as a library containing the largest collection of literature on sex in the world . There was also a research laboratory where the portly , walrus-moustached Hirschfeld -- known as the " Einstein of Sex " -- formulated dubious aphrodisiacs and anti-impotence medicines , and supervised the world 's first sex reassignment surgery . <p> The Institute also boasted a museum of sexual pathology that held up a mirror to the risque desires of Berlin 's inhabitants and became something of an unlikely tourist attraction . It was stuffed , Isherwood noted when he visited , with sado-masochistic and fetishistic props . He and Auden giggled as they went around displays of whips and chains , high-heeled boots , half-trousers sported by flashers under their coats , mechanical masturbation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a Prussian officer beneath his uniform . Isherwood later admitted to having felt " a kinship with these freakish fellow tribesmen and their freakish customs " . He described the institute admiringly as a " sanctuary ... where sex was being treated with seriousness " . <p> The Institute of Sexology , a new exhibition at the Wellcome Collection , celebrates the scientific study of sex that Hirschfeld , along with Richard von Krafft-Ebing and Havelock Ellis , helped to found . Last week , I found myself in the Wellcome 's storerooms , wearing purple plastic gloves as I previewed some of the artefacts that will be on display alongside the scientific charts and graphs that gave early sexology a legitimate , disinterested air . It was like Christmas : everything was parcelled in bubble wrap , which curator Kate Forde carefully peeled open to reveal the erotica inside . Most of these objects were collected by Henry Wellcome , who was interested in amassing evidence of " phallic worship " as the origin of religiosity : there was a porcelain persimmon , in which were secreted a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one broken ) , and a saw-toothed anti-masturbation device intended for a young man . The handling of an ancient box , full of intricately carved tortoiseshell sex aids ( Hirschfeld apparently had an identical set in his collection ) , made me grateful to be wearing archival gloves . <p> There was also a turn-of-the-century vibrator , with the unfortunate name Veedee ; a pun on the Latin phrase , " Veni , vidi , vici " . The packaging made ambitious claims for it as a panacea , able to cure everything from colds to neurosis with its " curative vibration " . The device resembles a bulky hairdryer and was once a serious medical tool , used by doctors to induce the orgasms thought to reposition the wandering womb believed to cause hysteria . Before he began using hypnosis , Sigmund Freud , who claimed a certain expertise when he distinguished the vaginal from the clitoral orgasm ( he considered the later immature and inferior , to the annoyance of 1960s feminists ) , employed electrotherapy and massage at his own clinic -- one historian wonders if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masseur " . <p> The Wellcome exhibition makes clear that the pioneers of sexology , who followed Freud in putting sex at the centre of psychological life , were also political activists . Hirschfeld , who was homosexual , campaigned vigorously to have laws against both sodomy and abortion revoked , and argued for all consensual sex among adults to be considered outside the purview of the legal system . Communist psychoanalysts such as Wilhelm Reich , who moved to Berlin to join forces with Hirschfeld , believed that sexual liberation was the key to social revolution . Influenced by the Polish anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski , author of The Sexual Lives of the Savages ( 1929 ) , Reich believed that the bonds of the family and marriage were bourgeois shackles , and that , following the example of the Trobriand Islanders of Papua New Guinea , children should be raised collectively and adolescents encouraged to pursue free sex . For Reich , the Trobrianders ' relaxed attitude to sexuality , and correspondingly peaceful culture , showed the possibility of primitive communism , of utopia on Earth . <p> However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As Jews , sexologists and communists , they were everything Hitler abhorred . Hirschfeld suffered a fractured skull when he was accosted in the street and beaten up by Nazis . In 1933 , after Hitler assumed power , the Institute of Sex Research was vandalised by storm troopers -- they poured ink over the photos , documents and archive files , smashed the exhibition cases , and played football with the erotic artefacts inside . A plaster bust of Hirschfeld , then in exile in Paris , was paraded on a wooden stake to the Opernplatz , where Brown Shirts tossed it on an enormous pyre of 100,000 " un-Germanic " books . Hirschfeld was sitting in a cinema when he happened to see newsreel footage of the fire , which he described as like witnessing his own funeral . Reich 's works -- including The Function of the Orgasm ( 1927 ) -- were among those burned and , similarly blacklisted , he was also forced to flee Berlin . <p> In 1939 Reich emigrated to the US , where he joined Malinowski at the New School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exile . There he built an Orgone Energy Accumulator , a box that he thought could channel the libidinous force of the universe . Gullible Beats and bohemians -- including Burroughs , Ginsberg , Bellow and Mailer -- sat inside patiently hoping for sexual enlightenment ( visitors to the exhibition can try an orgasmatron for themselves ) . By the time Reich arrived in the States , Alfred Kinsey , a 44-year-old professor of zoology at Indiana University had just begun collecting interviews for his monumental study of American sexuality . Kinsey taught what was quaintly known as the " marriage course " at the university ( nicknamed the " copulating class " ) . " In an uninhibited society " -- Kinsey began the class with a reference to the Trobriand Islands -- " a 12-year-old would know most of the biology which I will have to give you in formal lessons " . Disappointed by the dearth of scientific literature on sex -- " mainly morals masquerading under the name of science " -- he began interviewing people about their sexual histories in an ambitious attempt to fill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evaluations of his subjects and guaranteed them complete confidentiality : he avoided euphemism , and rattled off between 350 and 521 direct questions , maintaining eye contact all the while . Each interview took an average of one to three hours per case , depending on the subject 's experience ( the longest took 17 hours ) . By using a unique secret code , he estimated he could boil his research down from what would have taken 20 to 25 pages to a one-page grid , information that was punched into Hollerith cards and tabulated using an IBM computer . Kinsey 's carefully coded files -- which formed the basis of his landmark studies , Sexual Behavior in the Human Male ( 1948 ) , and Sexual Behavior in the Human Female ( 1953 ) -- were kept in a series of locked fireproof filing cabinets at The Institute for Sex Research . Kinsey boasted that the 18,000 case histories he collected -- from paedophiles to politicians ( sometimes both ) -- contained enough material " to blow up America " . <p> Kinsey 's Institute , which oversaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's pioneering clinic in Berlin . An obsessive collector , Kinsey amassed a similarly diverse museum of sexual ephemera , some of which will be on display at the Wellcome . Though he publicly dismissed Hirschfeld , who had conducted his own sexual survey , as more of a special pleader than objective scientist , Kinsey was himself a lot more prescriptive than he liked to admit . Underneath his cool scientific detachment was a crusading humanitarianism that bubbled up between the lines of everything he wrote . Clara Kinsey claimed that her husband 's work represented " an unvoiced plea for sexual tolerance " . Building on Hirschfeld 's doctrine of " sexual indeterminancy " , Kinsey developed a sliding scale that was radical in that it made sexual orientation a matter of degree : while only 4% of men were exclusively homosexual , 37% had enjoyed a homosexual experience ( " more than one male in three , " he emphasised ) . <p> Kinsey used his statistics to ridicule the existing sex laws ( sodomy , for example , was illegal in Indiana , as was oral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 80% of its women , he was fond of saying , could theoretically be sent to prison for what they 'd done sexually . Conservatives attacked him for undermining the institution of the family ; McCarthyites accused him of spearheading a communist plot to weaken American morality ; and J Edgar Hoover launched an investigation into Kinsey 's background in an attempt to undermine him . Nevertheless , in 1955 , a year before Kinsey 's death , the American Law Institute drafted an influential Model Penal Code . This drew on Kinsey 's studies to reject the concept of " deviant sexual behaviour " and led to the reform of the sex laws . <p> Kinsey 's statistics helped to lay the foundations for the sexual revolution of the 1960s , when views of sexuality were transformed in ways he could not have imagined . William Masters and Virginia Johnson continued Kinsey 's work , focusing not only on personal histories , but the biology of sex . ( Few knew that Kinsey had conducted similar research , filming his team of sex researchers having sex with various volunteers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Masters and Johnson used specialist equipment , including a camera hidden in a transparent dildo , nicknamed Ulysses , to record the physiology of coitus .

One of these features a Neanderthal-looking man lost in the equally bushy armpits of his female lover . <p> Following the birth of the contraceptive pill , which was licensed in 1960 , feminists seized on the similarities Masters and Johnson detected between male and female sexual responses to insist on women 's right to orgasmic pleasure . The duo , who married in 1971 , pioneered " sensate therapy " to treat sexual dysfunction , and controversially used sexual surrogates to that end . However , unlike Hirschfeld and Kinsey , they did n't exhibit an unreservedly open response to sexual difference , claiming in a 1978 book to have " cured " several homosexuals . In the 1980s they also fuelled hysteria about Aids , claiming it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmitted by mosquitoes and toilet seats .

I ca n't relate to the media 's stereotypes of intersex people : they just are n't about me -- and others like me -- at all . <p> I 'm a person just like anyone else , who happens to be intersex . So why do our lives and our bodies and our identities continue to be written about as though we 're so different over and over again ? <p> Being born with atypical sex traits is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm too busy going to work , making plans to meet up with friends , buying groceries , you know , standard life stuff . I have a life , and being intersex is part of that life , but it 's not the only part or even the dominant part . But the part of my consciousness that being intersex takes up is a pretty great one : I love who I am , and I love my body , my identity , my intersex friends . I 'm out to many people in my life , and no one treats me weirdly , considers it " scandalous " that I dare to leave the house or wonders how on Earth my girlfriend can " accept " me and find me desirable . <p> Intersex people in popular culture are still too often portrayed as shocking , used as a plot twist in the medical drama right before the cut to commercial , played for laughs as a cheap punchline about " hermaphrodites " that seems to come out of nowhere . Whenever it happens , it instantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're thought of at all , we 're conceptualized as biologically impossible half-men , half-women . We 're seen as objects of curiosity , or of fetishization ; or perceived as medical anomalies and something to be " fixed " . The Oxford English Dictionary 's definition of intersex actually uses the word " abnormal " . <p> None of that is accurate . <p> To the media outlets interested in writing truthfully about intersex people : focus on who we are as human beings . Raise awareness that we exist , and that we 're fighting for our basic human rights : it 's been routine since the 50s to medically -- often surgically -- alter intersex kids ' bodies without their consent , so that we can live as " normal " girls and boys . Intersex activists like myself have been working to stop these violations since the early 90s in the UK and the US -- and now globally . <p> There are some opportunities for journalists to shine an important light on the issues that intersex people face in a responsible way -- for instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competing in the Commonwealth Games and , maybe , the Olympics for having naturally high testosterone levels . ( Though , coverage of South African runner Caster Semaya hardly gives me hope for that . ) There are articles that I want read , to see exist in the world and in which I could see myself reflected -- but we ca n't be written about as a props or oddities . Reporters need to write about us as the complex people we are , and about us as more than our identities as intersex people . <p> The number of articles published about Chandler is probably increasing every minute . I 'm not going to read them . Stories that reduce her humanity to her being intersex are n't worth my time , or anybody else's.

It offers additional functionality over and above everything already being delivered for Universal Credit . It 'll allow households to report changes online and make changes to their Claimant Commitment to-do list online , with face-to-face support remaining available , especially for those who need extra help . " <p> Nonetheless , even this milestone has again been overshadowed by the latest NAO report into Universal Credit , published in November 2014 . The digital service was criticised for already being delayed , and for a lack of a contingency plan that could cost taxpayers ? 2.8bn if the system has further problems . While the digital service is welcomed , plenty of risks remain . Cunnington still faces many challenges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our questions by email , not in a face-to-face interview , citing time pressures - and it should be noted that his answers were provided before the latest NAO report was published . His caution -- or that of the DWP press office -- is perhaps understandable , after his first press experience in the job saw him skewered by the Daily Telegraph over comments in an interview with Civil Service World magazine earlier this year . He did not , however , avoid any of the question we put to him . <p> " It 's been quite a year -- there have n't been many low points . Much of what we do is challenging due to the size and scale of the department , but we 're making progress . We 're at the beginning of a transformation in DWP -- we 're starting to do the right work in the right way in the right places , " he says . <p> To deal with the lack of readily available skills , Cunnington created an in-house training capability , the DWP Digital Academy . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've created a Digital Academy in Leeds too . We have trained more than 1,000 people to varying degrees . The aim is to grow digital skills in DWP . The Academy graduates go on to work in the teams driving digital development , meaning we 're growing our own capability rather than relying on external consultants , " he says . <p> " We 're making good progress , defining how DWP should look and operate in the future . It 's been great to see digital being used to drive the transformation -- but even better to see that it 's not just about designing digital online services . Transformation includes how we deliver good customer service , which meets the needs of customers in an automated and efficient way , " says Cunnington . <p> " We 've recruited some great people with the relevant skills and experience we need . Some of these are already building our new digital services . The market is competitive and we 're looking at how we offer an attractive proposition to candidates , to give them the flexibility they often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skills and expertise we 're looking for . We 've found that the challenge of working with large-scale digital services in a department the size of DWP is an attractive one .

The whole story has to fit together <p> Kevin Cunnington , DWP <p> " There 's a lot of really positive interest in how we put customers at the heart of our thinking and deliver services that meet their needs . One of the biggest challenges has been building understanding of the role for digital in this , alongside the role for IT , change , and developing skills . The whole story has to fit together . We 've tackled this by getting out and about talking to our colleagues , other departments and our suppliers about what we 're doing , " he says . <p> " The hardest challenge in an organisation of this size and complexity is applying agile iterative approaches at scale . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach to a commissioning approach which delivers user features over a period of continuous delivery . Our new digital initiatives are adopting this approach and the new operating model created by the DWP 's Business Transformation Group embraces this and works closely with our technologists to ensure that transformation is delivered in manageable and agile chunks . " <h> No more IT mega-deals <p> Like every other major Whitehall department , part of DWP 's commitment to government digital strategy is to move away from the outsourcing mega-deals of the past . As HM Revenue &amp; Customs has found out , the scrutiny for DWP over making that change -- and the risks it presents to paying the UK 's multibillion-pound benefits bill -- will be intense . <p> How will DWP tackle the challenge of bringing in multiple suppliers , on smaller contracts , given the scale of its existing IT ? <p> " The contracts we have with our major suppliers are coming to a natural end in manageable phases over the course of the next year or so . This provides us with an ideal opportunity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to disaggregating into specific self-contained services , " says Cunnington . <p> " Some of this work has already taken place -- for example , our networking contract -- and this activity alone has resulted in significant savings . We are approaching the remainder in the same open way , combining our retendering activities with our strategic thinking , " he says . <p> " Our biggest challenge in moving from large-scale outsourced models to disaggregated sub-contracting models is that there is a need to bring the real knowledge of our systems and capabilities back in-house and the skills that go with them . We are progressing well on this journey and have completed a detailed modelling of our existing systems and our proposed future roadmap , using our own teams of DWP people . " <h> Public versus private <p> Like many of the digital leaders brought into Whitehall , Cunnington was recruited for his private sector experience . But he says the differences in the public sector are less than some people might expect . <p> " The challenges and language are pretty consistent across public and private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transforming large organisations , " he says . <p> " Any transformation of this size across DWP or government has some consistent themes and challenges and these are no different here to the private sector .

We need to build services in an agile and collaborative way ; and our people have to have the right skills , regularly refreshed , aligned to professions and careers . " <p> So the building blocks are in place .

I believe so <p> As winter has begun this week and we face three months of cold and wet , I thought I would write about butterflies , to remind us of sunshine and warmth . A new butterfly guide has just been published which is , to use the old seducer 's phrase , not like all the others . <p> Seeing Butterflies by Philip Howse , a retired Professor of Entomology at the University of Southampton , shows you , not how to identify species , but how to find pictures in the wings of butterflies and moths of other creatures , from the real world . The list of these creatures is fascinating , and it includes birds , snakes , frogs , bats , falcons , spiders , hornets , salamanders , foxes , millipedes , caterpillars and others . <p> Perhaps you need a moment to take that in . These are -- Philip Howse is convinced -- real images of other creatures . The author maintains they are not simply accidents , like for example the cloud in the shape of the face of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mail underneath a headline phrased as a question ( " Does this strange cloud show the face of Jesus ? " ) -- a question to which the answer is always No . <p> On the contrary , the pictures on Lepidoptera wings have evolved there through natural selection , Professor Howse believes , as a direct means of helping butterflies and moths escape from insect-eating predators , such as birds , by suddenly startling them and so gaining a millisecond in which to flee . In the past , we humans have not readily seen these images , as we look at Lepidoptera in a conventional way and usually from the same angle , as " set " specimens with their wings spread out ; but birds and other predators may see them in a very different manner and be strongly affected . <p> Nearly five years ago , Professor Howse launched the idea with a ground-breaking book entitled Butterflies -- Messages From Psyche , which illustrated some startling images , such as a snake in the wingtips of an atlas moth from South-east Asia , and an unmistakable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyed hawkmoth ( found in Britain ) when seen upside down . <p> I wrote about it here , and I said I thought it was convincing , although scientific opinion was by no means universally convinced . One of Britain 's leading butterfly experts said to me : " It 's all mumbo jumbo . " <p> However , another leading expert told me he thought Professor Howse was on to something , and the theory is gaining ground , to the extent that it is now warmly endorsed in the foreword to Seeing Butterflies by Jeremy Thomas , Professor of Ecology at Oxford and the doyen of all British lepidopterists . <p> The new volume , which is exquisitely illustrated with photos of butterflies and moths from all over the world , takes the theory further . What Philip Howse is doing , in effect , is creating a whole new branch of entomological science , and it has a name -- satyric mimicry , meaning the use of images to make organisms such as butterflies appear ambiguous to an observer , just as the Satyrs of Greek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The " eye spots " on many butterflies are the most obvious example of this ; the insect can suddenly show the face of a much larger creature . <p> But there are bodies as well as faces to be seen . To take another of our well-known butterflies , the small tortoiseshell , the professor says that the body pattern of a bumblebee is clearly discernible in the sequence of colour bands on the leading edge of the forewing -- black yellow black yellow black white -- and I agree . A butterfly-eating bird might well avoid a bumblebee with a sting . <p> Even more fascinatingly , he gives us an explanation for the beautiful run of tiny turquoise crescents along the tortoiseshell 's lower wing edge -- something I have admired since I was a young boy . These are a representation , he postulates , of a poisonous caterpillar , such as that of the lackey moth , something birds would also leave alone ; and if you look at the photo of the caterpillar he provides , you can see it . <p> " Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals with which they share their environment , " Philip Howse writes . But he is convinced that they do , and Seeing Butterflies will surely convince others . It is not only a beautiful book to look at , but it has the exhilarating feeling about it of discovery .

The milestone could soon lead to new ways of developing drugs and medical treatments . <p> The findings are the latest in the field of synthetic biology , which attempts to create new biological molecules and even novel life-forms capable of carrying out a range of important medical and industrial functions , from manufacturing pharmaceuticals to detoxifying polluted land . <p> " Synthetic biology is delivering some truly amazing advances that promise to change the way we understand and treat disease , " said Professor Patrick Maxwell , chair of the cellular medicine board of the Medical Research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " The UK excels in this field and this latest advance offers the tantalising prospect of using designer biological parts as a starting point for an entirely new class of therapies and diagnostic tools that are more effective and have a longer shelf-life , " Professor Maxwell said . <p> The discovery , by scientists at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge , also widens the scope for finding extraterrestrial life-forms on other planets based on completely different biochemistry to that used by life on Earth . <p> " When we look for life elsewhere , either in the Solar System or on exoplanets beyond , this discovery means that we may have to widen the boundaries of the conditions where we think life may exist , " said Philipp Holliger , who led the MRC research team . <p> " It expands the chemical range that one can envisage life living in .

XNA is able to store and replicate genetic information , just like its two natural equivalents DNA and RNA , and was synthesise in Dr Holliger 's lab three years ago . <p> The enzymes were themselves made from folded strands of XNA molecules . This extra enzymatic property of the artificial genetic material mimics the natural RNA enzymes found in many organisms , including humans , the scientists said . <p> " Until recently , it was thought that DNA and RNA were the only molecules that could store genetic information and , together with proteins , the only biomolecules able to form enzymes , " Dr Holliger said . <p> " Our work suggests that , in principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's molecules that will support the catalytic processes required for life .

They were also able to join XNA strands together , which represents one of the first steps in creating a replicating biological system , Dr Holliger said . <p> The technology could be developed to make drugs that can block cancer-causing genes or bind to the RNA of viruses such as Ebola or HIV . <p> " It may be possible to design therapeutic XNA molecules that can cleave to an oncogene cancer gene or to viral RNA , and because XNA does not exist in nature it will not be broken down quite so fast as DNA or RNA which means it will work for longer , " Dr Holliger said . <p> " Our XNAs are chemically extremely robust and , because they do not occur in nature , they are not recognised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make them an attractive candidate for long-lasting treatments that can disrupt disease-related RNA , " he said .

Indeed , it is wonderful to see all his works , but the narrative is skewed . It begins with a painting of the Covent Garden auction house that Blake visited as a child . He was prodigious and largely self- educated . Apprenticed to an engraver , he quickly became commercially successful , which meant he earned a good living by copying other artists ' work . However , he was n't interested in compromise . <p> The power of Blake 's work begins to emerge at the end of the first gallery .

Soon Blake would abandon his commercial success and pursue with dogged independence his own creative project . For this reason , he spent the rest of his life in poverty and , aside from a few disciples , his work was overlooked . Some commentators have pointed out that this was probably for the best .

According to the Old Testament , he was exiled and forced to eat " grass like an ox " .

" In his view , evil was not merely " bad " , but dynamic , generative , even liberating . <p> Milton , he argued , " was of the devil 's party without knowing it . " Blake 's love of Paradise Lost ( 1667 ) was rooted in his belief that Milton glorified the devil . This is shown in Blake 's eerie Portrait Head of Milton ( c1800-1805 ) . Milton 's serenity as a wise old man of letters is undercut by the serpent weaving around him , an apple in its mouth . <p> One of my favourite works in the exhibition is The Circle of the Lustful ( 1824-27 ) , Blake 's illustration of canto five of Dante 's Divine Comedy ( 1308-1321 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great gust of wind , which appears flowing and blue like water , carrying naked lovers , both men and women , in a swirl of voluptuous punishment .

@@4803235 <p> The American sporting establishment was accused on Tuesday of presiding over a " culture of silence " that has enabled professional athletes to commit domestic violence with impunity . <p> Top executives and counsel from the main football , basketball , hockey and baseball leagues appeared before the Senate commerce committee after a string of controversies involving athletes accused of abusing their partners or children . <p> The decision to lift his suspension was made by a former federal judge , Barbara Jones , at the end of an arbitration process agreed to by the NFL and the players ' union . It was a major blow to the NFL and the reputation of its commissioner , Roger Goodell . <p> " There is a long list of players in the NFL , NBA , NHL and Major League Baseball who have been charged with , and in some cases convicted of , domestic violence , and the leagues have done little or nothing in response , " said Jay Rockefeller , the Democratic chairman of the committee . <p> Rockefeller said professional athletes had a particular responsibility as role models , condemned the reports of a " culture of silence " within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Republicans and Democrats on the committee were unified in their disapproval of what they said were lax procedures for dealing with abusive athletes , particularly those who for whatever reason are not subject to criminal prosecution . <p> Missouri Democrat Claire McCaskill said virtually none of the leagues were doing enough to hold players to account . She pointed out that MLB commissioner Bud Selig has never sanctioned a player for domestic violence . <p> Nevada Republican Dean Heller told the executives : " When you 're worried more about getting back on the field instead of stopping abuse , your priorities are out of order . " <p> Although all sports leagues were condemned , the focus was on the NFL . Heller said it was only the emergence of security footage showing Rice attacking his partner Janay Palmer in an elevator at an Atlantic City casino that prompted America 's " collective conscience " demanded action . <p> Goodell initially levelled only a two-game suspension against Rice . The commissioner used the emergence of the footage , which he said constituted fresh evidence , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actions . <p> However , Jones found that Rice had already admitted the details of his serious assault to Goodell , so the increased punishment was unfounded . Rice is no longer with the Ravens , but could now be signed to another team . <p> The NFL 's representative at the hearing , Troy Vincent , said Friday 's ruling showed Goodell had made " a critical mistake " . " We failed , " he said . " The commissioner failed to impose the proper discipline in the Ray Rice case in the very beginning . " <p> Vincent , the executive vice-president of football operations at the NFL , struggled to hold back tears during his opening remarks when he detailed his own experience watching his mother being beaten unconscious when he was growing up . <p> Regaining his composure , Vincent said the league was " undertaking intensive and exhaustive review " and would introduce a new conduct policy for players in the future . A meeting to review the new conduct policy with owners will take place in the next two weeks . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules to govern accountability for misconduct and to establish fair process for player and employee discipline , " he said . <p> Vincent said the league was also seeking a mandatory education process for those involved in it " to ensure that everyone understands the full scope of behaviour that constitutes domestic violence , child abuse and sexual assault " . Support would also be given by the NFL to families , Vincent said , adding : " We recognise that we have to break the culture of silence . " <p> Rockefeller , from West Virginia , chided the representative from the NFL 's player 's union , saying her association had put the committee " under enormous pressure " not to hold the hearing . <p> Teri Patterson , deputy managing director of the NFL players ' association , called the suspension of Rice " arbitrary " . <p> In a tense exchange with Heller , Patterson confirmed the players ' association is at odds with the NFL over changes to the personal conduct policy and related disciplinary procedures . <p> The senator asked Patterson if the player @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman with one a punch on Wednesday " and then turn up on the field on Sunday . <p> " Absolutely not , " she replied . " We do not condone domestic violence . " <p> Kelly Ayotte , a Republican from New Hampshire , echoed other senators who noted the failure of any of the league commissioners to attend the hearing . All sent lower-ranking substitutes from their organisations ; Selig dispatched an outside counsel to represent him at the hearing . <p> " It 's pretty convenient that none of them were here today , and I think that does say something about how big a commitment there is going to be on this , " she said .

It might have been better to translate the jargon littering today 's euphoric event . <p> Not only was " the plan " repeatedly hailed for its " pipeline visibility " but " we have a massive execution responsibility " , said Lord Deighton , chief Treasury progress chaser . This sounded ominously like a draconian new method -- perhaps imposed by would-be Chinese investors -- for dealing with slacking labourers building HS2 . Which was itself a " cross-cutting " " engine for regeneration " , a potential " infrastructure catapult " . <p> Alexander omitted to say that the Government 's new plan to build and sell homes was dramatic proof of market failure .

Deighton announced another market intervention -- forcing government contractors to hire apprentices or " incentivising a step-change " in investment in skills as he put it . This is a shameless lift from Labour . So , was this all " electioneering " , one contractor asked . " If electioneering is trying to do a good job , then I 'm all for it , " Deighton said , adding that Alexander 's infrastructure committee -- " cross-cutting " , of course -- was " hungering after opportunities to remove obstacles to driving the projects through " . One could imagine gangs of Treasury officials excavating railway cuttings with bare hands . Lord D will go far , at least in any government of which Alexander is a part . <p> A puzzled businessman asked how much " new money " was involved . Of course there 's no new money ! The projects have been announced and re-announced so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's even old money . Or , after Osborne 's Autmun Statement , any money at all . <p> But maybe that 's unduly cynical .

@@4803240 study part-time for a postgrad due to financial constraints -- but there are other benefits to studying over a longer period . <p> It gives students more time to develop their critical and innovative thinking , says Paul Waller , associate professor in biomedical science at Kingston University . He recommends that students become a full part of the university 's academic community , by interacting with peers and experts , even if they only study part-time . <p> Many part-time postgraduate students are returning to study after a gap , and will benefit from all the support offered by universities , such as financial advice , careers services or emotional support , without having to take a break from their career . <p> But part-time study , especially if undertaken alongside family , work or voluntary commitments , is a big step . One of the biggest mistakes students make is underestimating the commitment required , says Waller . " A full-time course is the same as a full-time job , so taking on a part-time degree is like taking on a part-time job -- the equivalent of at least 20 hours work per week . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> However that level of commitment to personal development is an asset to any current or potential employer , says Susan Hughes , a careers adviser for the National Careers Service . Besides gaining specific expertise , part-time students develop many transferable skills , such as time management and research skills . But one of the most fundamental benefits is personal pride , says Hughes , a former part-time postgraduate student herself . " The sense of achievement was immense . It ca n't be underestimated . " <p> Those thinking of doing a part-time postgrad should first do their research into the course content , its timetable and whether it has professional accreditation . It 's also important to make sure your interests match the research interests of departmental staff , and find out where previous students ended up . <p> Look into provision of services on and off campus - can students access the library and other facilities outside standard university hours ? Does the university offer remote access to electronic journals and literature ? Are postgraduate societies also available to part-time students ? <p> James Ashford , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likes the flexibility he gets with his part-time master 's in creative writing at the University of Cambridge . " It gives me more time to enjoy my last few years a student , whilst getting a foot in the door of the working world , " he says . " Courses at Cambridge tend to be extremely intense , so another pro is that the part-time nature of the course takes the pressure off a bit . " <p> Ashford , whose course is research-based , does n't feel disadvantaged by studying part-time , but does say it makes it harder to form close bonds with coursemates . <p> Although the Student Loans Company does not finance postgraduate education , there are still options available to those without a trust fund . A career development loan can help , and universities will advise students about any scholarships and bursaries available . Hughes says if you 're employed -- and your postgrad will benefit the organisation -- it 's worth submitting a training proposal to negotiate part-funding from your employer . <p> Part-time study was the only affordable option for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an MSc in government , policy and politics from Birkbeck .

" Given that I 'm working full-time , to say time management is crucial is an understatement , " she says . She is undertaking postgraduate research via distance part-time learning in Highlands and Islands literature at the Centre for Nordic Studies , not to further any career aspirations but for the love of learning the subject . <p> That part-time postgraduate courses take longer to complete than full-time courses is an asset as far as Crow is concerned .

Rooney almost quit the game because of over-coaching as a teenager . <p> More than 1500 coaches from across the country gather at St George 's Park this weekend to discuss the " England DNA " . Pride in the shirt and the country are part of the " DNA " and " the England badge and the national anthem will be explored and players challenged to create personal meanings for both " . <p> England want all players to be " aware and respectful of " English football 's " rich football heritage " and respect former internationals . " Gareth joked the other day that some of the Under-21s do n't remember him as a player and that was very recent , ' ' said Ashworth of the Under-21s head coach , who finished playing eight years ago . " Rooney is a great icon , and the Shearers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back too far because the players wo n't remember them . " They will be taught about 1966 . <p> Given English football 's occasional problems with race issues , England players will be reminded of the importance of " celebrating diversity " . But the central strand of the " DNA " is " to develop reflective , resourceful and resilient England players who display outstanding confidence , creativity , concentration , communication , control and commitment " . <p> Hunger too . " One of the biggest problems in our country is we reward people before they are really successful , ' ' said Southgate , who will advise 15-year-olds upwards that their " attitude and character " will help determine how far they go . " England is all about pressure so we have to focus on the guys who we think can get there and make sure they get the full education . ' ' Getting an MA in DNA . <p> Southgate , Ashworth and company are challenging all players coming through the system to confront and change the " stereotypes " of England internationals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have long been characterised by our passion , fighting spirit and effort " . England expects more than that , seeking " technically excellent players " . England have had these before , including such gems as Glenn Hoddle , but rarely built around them . <p> The thinking behind giving the players a memory stick is that the FA felt that contenders and established seniors alike would not read a paper version currently circulating at St George 's Park . " We 've studied how the modern player learns , and lot of it is through visual , ' ' said Crocker , the FA 's head of coach and player development . " So that 's why we 've created a pool of montages and a lot of words are backed up with a double click on and pictures of England players . " <p> On the memory stick , players will be informed that they must " strive for the highest standards on and off the field . We do n't settle for anything less , excellence is the minimum requirement . " The FA has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Les Reed , but the continued deterioration of tournament performances , and the arrival of the energetic Ashworth at St George 's Park , has accelerated the move towards defining the " DNA " of an England player . <p> " Germany famously went back and had a look at the whole thing in 2000 and started to link in with the clubs , ' ' said Ashworth . " Ninety per cent of players ' development is with clubs because they have more time with them but there is collaboration . The connection and interaction with the clubs is better than it 's ever been . It 's not club v country , it 's club and country . The clubs want good young players coming through their academies and we want good young players in England teams . " <p> So what can England offer that clubs like Manchester City , Manchester United and Southampton ca n't ? Different experiences . " Our Under-17s had a unique experience against Brazil this week with some of the things that were going on off the pitch as well as on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you have to cope with all of that , ' ' said Southgate . " Also , the experience of being away for a period of time for a tournament is very different than life with clubs . There 's a lot of good work going on in the clubs but they 're also looking for some guidance . " <p> Southgate has been driving the " playing philosophy " element to the England " DNA " , another reminder of the huge influence the former England defender has within the FA . According to the " DNA " , the focus when England have the ball is " to intelligently dominate possession selecting the right moments to progress the play and penetrate the opposition . " Swift pressing is required when the opponents have the ball . " England teams aim to regain possession intelligently and as early and as efficiently as possible . " In terms of formation , " England development teams will play with tactical flexibility . " <p> Some of the development teams have been playing 4-3-3 while Hodgson has used a diamond this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4-3-3 or 4-4-2 ? ' ' countered Ashworth . " No , it is a philosophy and principles of play . In terms of developing , we have a duty to get our best players on the pitch . If the two best players at Under-16s are No 9s , then we have to find a way of getting them on the pitch without having one sat on the bench . We are not rigid . " <p> The problem at senior level is that managers have frequently sought to shoehorn the best individuals into the team , as happened with Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard , without necessarily thinking about the collective balance . The blend will be improved when more players emerge and acquire club experience , particularly in the Champions League . <p> " The more the better but it 's not just about numbers , ' ' said Ashworth . " We could have 60 England-qualified players that might be playing regularly in the lower half of the Premier League but given that it 's important for them to experience high-pressure games -- playing for titles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 playing in the top six or seven teams ? Yes , you probably would . So it 's not necessarily about quantity , more about quality . " <p> Southgate refused to be bowed by the decline in the number of English players in the Premier League . " We ca n't sit back and say ' it s not fair , foreign owners and foreign coaches are n't picking English players ' , ' ' said the former Middlesbrough manager . " Our responsibility is to help the development of English players so that they are selectable . " <p> The dream is for England players all to exude certain qualities from 15 upwards . " There has to be a consistency in the message we 're trying to get out to the players , ' ' said Hodgson . " The earlier we can get that message to them , the better . It 's very important that we have clear principles of what we want them to be doing in defensive positions , what we want them to be doing with the ball , without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The earlier we can get these messages across to them -- and really bed these messages in -- it should really help the senior team . " <p> Hodgson wants youngsters to arrive in the senior team with more experience , the so-called " cap accumulation " seen notably in those teams who progressed far at the summer World Cup . " We were averaging mid-30s , ' ' said Ashworth of the number of age-group caps per player on reaching the seniors . " Some of our competitors were averaging high-50s ( out of a possible 80+ ) . We were on average around 20 caps down once they were into the senior team . " <p> Southgate focused on the World Cup winners . " Germany are a young side but they are a side with enormous experience at international level ( including Under-21 ) and in big Champions League matches too , ' ' said the former England international , who was scouting for the FA in Brazil . " Everyone will have recognised that in the summer we were short of big-match experience . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Welbeck who had had Champions League experience this season ( and Welbeck previously ) but many have n't . One of the things we have to address is the psychology , the belief . ' ' <p> England are still focused on delivering a trophy within a decade . " Obviously the chairman ( Greg Dyke ) has mentioned the 2022 World Cup , ' ' said Ashworth before acknowledging the work required , starting with the " DNA " . " From our point of view , we want to see improvements in our performances . " Step by step .

@@4813231 <p> Despite the strides made to confront it , domestic violence remains a prolific ill in our society . Statistics cited by Soda ( Survivors of Domestic Abuse ) tell us that one in four women and one in six men are affected by domestic violence , with two women killed each week by a current or former partner . And while there have been many worthy government initiatives to tackle the problem , it sill causes devastation to the lives of countless individuals , families and communities . There is a danger that services only associate domestic violence with a particular demographic , often linked to their own eligibility criteria , meaning that many victims do not have their needs met . A joined-up approach from different institutions is required , to increase exposure and help those that suffer not to feel stigmatised and hence reluctant to come forward . <p> As a survivor of domestic violence , my biggest bugbear is that services are for the few rather than the many in spite of the prevalence of this problem .

Women 's Aid reported last year having to turn away 155 women and 100 children in need of refuge accommodation . <p> This brings into sharp focus the dilemmas that those suffering can face . On one hand , we encourage people to come forward and leave their abusive partners and even chide them for not doing so sooner ; but on the other , we are making it harder for people to leave as some are being left without support .

We need assertive approaches to domestic violence that span the life course , such as teaching about positive relationships and non-violence as part of the school curriculum , as they do in Canada and New Zealand . We also need advertising campaigns that clearly demonstrate it is not a problem that stops when we reach a certain age but can affect people of all generations . <p> We still have a long way to go , but let us begin by at least getting the issue into the open , so that adults and children can talk about it and those affected are made aware of how they can get help .

@@4813239 <p> The bunches of bananas that Teo Kataratambi and her husband , Silver , grow on their land fetch the equivalent of only ? 1.40 each . The larger bunches that they used to grow sold for double that amount . <p> A few years ago , though , the Kataratambis noticed a drop in the size and quality of the fruit they produce on their small third-generation farm in Nyamiyada village , south-west Uganda . <p> " In the first years , the soil was good but then it changed , " says Silver . Teo adds : " We do n't make much money . We ca n't break even . " <p> The change was caused by years of farming without using sufficient fertilisers to replenish the soil 's nutrients . The result , as the Kataratambis now see , is poor crop yields . <p> In contrast with their counterparts in the global north and Asia , many farmers in sub-Saharan Africa rely on manure rather than chemical fertilisers . But the organic alternative can not meet the demand . <p> Fallen leaves help fertilise the soil on a banana plantation in south-west Uganda . <p> In Europe , organic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to Eurostat . Food and Agriculture Organisation data shows that , globally , less than 1% of agricultural land is farmed using organic methods . <p> Organic fertiliser can help freshen up Africa 's ailing , rusty-red soils , but there is not enough land available to produce manure in sufficient quantities , says Professor Ken Giller , a soil scientist at Wageningen University in the Netherlands . One cow can produce about 15kg of nitrogen in manure annually . But a healthy maize crop needs up to 100kg of nitrogen a hectare , Giller says . <p> Manure does n't contain all the nutrients that plants need to grow , adds Giller , leader of the N2Africa programme , which encourages African farmers to grow legumes to help fertilise their soil . Harvests have stagnated on the continent since the 1960s , according to data from the World Bank . On average , farmers in Africa harvest about one ton of maize ( corn ) a hectare , whereas their American counterparts reap up to 12 tons . <p> " Sub-Saharan Africa has by far the lowest rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading to increased hunger and food insecurity , " says Sarwat Hussain , a World Bank spokesperson . Ugandan farmers are among those that use fertiliser the least . <p> The changing climate and booming populations will add further demands on Africa 's overworked soils . At the UN climate change conference in Lima , Peru , in December , politicians and scientists will discuss the impact on agriculture and the role of fertiliser . <p> African farmers are sometimes put off chemical fertiliser <p> because of cost . The Kataratambis say they ca n't afford to buy chemical fertilisers -- consistently . <p> A bag of fertiliser could cost Ugandan farmers the equivalent of ? 40 -- double the sum paid by their American or European counterparts . Much of the extra expense comes from import and transport fees , since chemical fertiliser is often manufactured abroad . Some economists claim international fertiliser companies are manipulating the market by charging certain African nations more than richer countries . <p> Martin Byamukama , sales manager of a fertiliser dealership , sits in a quiet alcove off the main drag of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trading area for agricultural products . Byamukama and his colleagues travel by road to Kenya to buy fertiliser ( Uganda is land-locked ) . This travel ramps up the cost . Byamukama calculates that it costs him about ? 4.60 in fuel , import and loading fees to transport a 50kg bag of phosphate fertiliser from Mombassa in Kenya back to Kampala . Byamukama 's customers -- farmers and smaller fertiliser dealers , many of whom work in villages around 200km away -- can add another ? 14 to the bill . <p> About 1,800 meters up Mount Elgon in eastern Uganda , Betty Liaibich 's one acre plot of rocky land feeds her 10 children and pays for their school fees .

They have been using it ever since . <p> Fertiliser is slightly cheaper here . The area is close to Kenya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ import the fertiliser themselves , rather than buying from Ugandan middle men . But still , Liaibich and her neighbours can not afford to buy the recommended amounts to get the best out of their crops . <p> Ugandan farmers suffer from high import costs for fertiliser because their country is landlocked <p> Subsidising the cost of fertiliser could encourage farmers to use more . National subsidy schemes in Malawi and Rwanda are showing some success . But they are controversial ; the World Bank warns that subsidies often benefit the wealthiest farmers rather the poorest , and that they can stifle the private sector and economic development . <p> Organisations such as the FAO are pushing for greener solutions , including encouraging farmers to grow trees and legumes to fertilise the soil . But most experts agree Africa 's green revolution ca n't blossom ( pdf ) without chemical fertiliser . <p> " Using legumes is a great way to help fertilise the soil , but we recognise that , on its own , it is not enough , " says Giller . " The bottom line is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organically . " <p> The process of revitalising African farming must be based on both conventional and alternative approaches , agrees Dr Bashir Jama , who runs a programme on soil health for the Alliance for the Green Revolution in Africa ( Agra ) , an NGO working to improve food security . <p> There is more to improving soil health than chemical fertilisers , says Jama , but they are essential to increasing production and meeting the goal to end hunger in Africa by 2025 , which was agreed by African leaders in June . <p> Nana Prossie owns a small stall in Kampala 's container village selling fertiliser and other agricultural products . <p> Without fertilisers , Jama warns , farmers will increasingly struggle to feed their families as the drain of nutrients from African soils becomes a major threat to food security on the continent over the next 20 years . <p> " It is a misconception to say Africa can grow crops using just organics . The rest of the world is fed using fertiliser , " says Jama . <p> Chemical fertiliser can help kickstart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , farmers can use the extra crop residues as organic manure , and so reduce their dependence on chemical fertiliser , suggests Jama . <p> Organic approaches are more sustainable in the long run , he says , but chemical fertiliser use is unlikely to grow in Africa to the levels seen in the West and Asia that cause environmental problems , he says . Without fertilisers , Jama warns , some vulnerable countries , including Niger , will struggle to feed their growing populations in as little as three years .

@@4819233 <h> Queen Fabiola of Belgium : Spanish aristocrat headhunted to marry King Baudouin of Belgium , to whom she was a popular consort <p> In the late 1950s it was decided that King Baudouin I , who had been on the Belgian throne for nine years , was lonely and needed a queen . An Irish nun from the Legion of Mary , Sister Veronica O'Brien , was sent by the future Cardinal Suenens , then auxiliary bishop of Malenes , to scour Europe for a suitable bride . The king gave two conditions : she had to be aristocratic , and like him she had to be a devout Catholic . <p> Sister O'Brien met the headmistress of a school in Madrid who recommended a former pupil , Fabiola de Mora y Aragon , the daughter of one of Spain 's biggest landowners , who was working as a nurse , to aid her in her search . It turned out that Fabiola herself fitted the bill -- Sister O'Brien described her in a letter to Suenens as " a breath of fresh air , tall , thin , well-built , good-looking and striking , bubbling with life , intelligence and energy " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his steadfast consort until his death in 1993 . <p> Fabiola Fernanda Maria de las Victorias Antonia Adelaida Mora y Aragon was born in her family 's Zurbano Palace in Madrid . Her father was the Marquess of Casa Riera , whose family had made a fortune from mining in the 19th century . She was a god-daughter of Queen Victoria Eugenie , a granddaughter of Queen Victoria . Her mother was Do ? a Blanca de Aragon y Carillo de Albornoz , whose family had strong links to the Spanish royal family , and in 1931 , when King Alfonso was forced by the republicans into exile , Fabiola 's family followed , moving between Paris and Switzerland until General Franco 's victory in the Spanish Civil War allowed them to return . <p> Fabiola trained as a nurse , living in her own apartment but dining every night at the palace ; she was thought at one time to have considered joining a holy order . Friends described her as shy and pious , and after she had rejected an aristocratic suitor as not being sufficiently serious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't catch a man " . <p> She had , indeed , resigned herself to spinsterhood until Sister Veronica came calling . She married King Baudouin in Brussels in 1960 . To celebrate the marriage , Spanish bakers created a type of bread , la fabiola , which is still eaten in the country today . In Belgium , Fabiola found great popularity with the people , and was often referred to as " Queen of all Belgians " ; the explorer Guido Derom named Queen Fabiola Mountains , a newly discovered range in the Antarctic , in her honour in 1961 . <p> It was a source of great sadness , however , that the couple were unable to produce an heir . Fabiola became pregnant five times but suffered a series of miscarriages and one stillbirth . " You know , I myself lost five children , " she said . " You learn something from that experience . I had problems with all my pregnancies , but you know , in the end I think life is beautiful . " <p> Given Belgium 's status as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Dutch-speaking Flemish in the north , she was obliged to tread carefully . Some Flemish nationalists accused her of not taking them seriously , but she maintained a determined neutrality , and she did take the trouble to learn Dutch , in which she became fluent -- as she was in French , German , Italian and English . <p> It was felt by some that occasionally Fabiola , who had associations with the Opus Dei conservative Catholic movement , wielded too much influence on her husband . Baudouin was enveloped in a major controversy in 1990 when he refused to give a parliament-approved bill legalising abortion his royal assent , one of his constitutional duties . Some partly blamed Fabiola 's Catholicism . He stepped down for one day to allow the government to pass the law and was then reinstated . <p> After he died in 1993 he was succeeded by his younger brother , Albert II .

Fabiola denied that it was a tax dodge but acknowledged she had " taken the political consequences insufficiently into account " and said she would close the fund . <p> She was admired for her involvement in social causes , particularly those related to mental health , children 's issues and women 's issues , and in 2001 the United Nations ' Food and Agriculture Organisation awarded her the Ceres Medal for her work championing rural women in developing countries .

@@4819236 <p> Six years after the onset of a crash that wiped more than 50% from its property market values , Ireland has roared back to be named the country with the fastest growing house prices in the world . <p> With average prices up 15% in a year , the country is top of an influential global house price index , ahead of Dubai and the UK . <p> Estate agent Knight Frank , which compiles the index , said Ireland had enjoyed a remarkable turnaround in fortunes over the past 12 months . As recently as summer 2012 , it was ranked 54th out of 55 countries surveyed , when house prices were falling by almost 10% a year following the damage wreaked by Ireland 's economic crash of 2008 . <p> The firm 's latest index puts the UK in fourth place , with prices up 10.5% in the year to September , making it one of only six countries to achieve double-digit price growth . At the bottom of the table is Cyprus , where prices were down more than 9% over the same period . <p> Ireland 's strong performance is largely down to the strength of the property market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Ranelagh . Over the past year the market has seen the return of bidding wars , with properties frequently selling for as much as 20% above the asking price . <p> Ireland is set to be the fastest growing eurozone economy this year , with Brussels predicting it will achieve 4.6% growth , although the latest data will exacerbate fears of a new house price bubble . <p> Knight Frank said that house prices in Ireland were still 39% below their pre-crisis peak of 2007 despite the 15% surge . Nevertheless , it said the country had pulled off a remarkable comeback , considering that it had " languished at the foot of the table " for most of the period from 2009 to 2012 . <p> Turkey is in second place in the table , up 14% , with Dubai third , up 12.5% . Australia is ninth after a 9.1% rise and Hong Kong is 20th place , after rising by 6.3% .

In Miami prices were up 10.3% year-on-year . <p> Kate Everett-Allen at Knight Frank 's international residential research arm said : " Fewer countries are reaching the heights of double-digit price growth , but it 's not all bad news .

@@4819238 <h> Six of the best : pieces of music inspired by swans <p> When Finnish composer Jean Sibelius witnessed 16 swans taking flight on 21 April 1915 , he described it as ' one of the great experiences of my life ' in a diary entry . It even inspired the famous horn theme heard in the finale of his Fifth Symphony . This was not the first time he was inspired by the majestic bird : in 1895 he composed The Swan of Tuonela , an orchestral tone poem alluding to the Finnish Kalevala saga , and later he wrote incidental music for Swedish playwright August Strindberg 's ' Fairy Drama ' , Swanwhite . <p> And so , as it is Sibelius 's 149th birthday today , we decided that we 'd mark the occasion with a look at six of the best pieces of music -- by him and by others -- inspired by the magnificient swan . <p> 1 . Sibelius : Symphony No. 5 ( third movement ) <p> After his sighting of 16 swans in flight on 21 April 1915 , Sibelius immediately sketched a musical themed based on the experience and incorporated it into his Fifth Symphony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ string opening , recalls the majestic movement of the swans and the sounds of their calls . <p> 2 . Sibelius : The Swan of Tuonela <p> Sibelius composed the orchestral tone poem , The Swan of Tuonela , in 1895 as part of his Lemmink ? inen Suite , based on the Finnish literary epic Kalevala . The piece explores the gloomy World of Death depicted in the saga . It is a dark and lyrical work , the mournful voice of a lone swan carried by a cor anglais melody . <p> 3 . Gibbons : The Silver Swan <p> Sibelius is n't the only composer to have honoured the regal swan with his music . English Renaissance composer Orlando Gibbons published a set of five-part madrigals and motets in 1612 and it included a choral work called The Silver Swan , which laments upon a swan 's death . <p> 4 . Saint-Sa ? ns : The Swan <p> There are n't many people who do n't recognise the heartrending melody of Saint-Sa ? ns 's The Swan . The most well known piece from Carnival of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fantasy ' by Saint-Sa ? ns with 14 movements , each representing a different creature -- it is scored for cello and two pianos . While the lyrical cello line evokes a serenely gliding swan , swirling semi-quaver motifs in the piano parts seem to represent the swan 's busy feet beneath the water . <p> 5 . Orff : Carmina Burana ( Olim lacus colueram ) <p> In the second part ( ' In the Tavern ' ) of his famous cantata Carmina Burana , Carl Orff depicts in music the suffering of a swan as it is roasted alive . The aria ' Olim lacus colueram ' ( ' Once I lived on lakes ' ) requires a tenor soloist to sing falsetto to demonstrate fully the fear and pain of the swan in its tormented final moments of life . <p> 6 .

Chinese and South Korean businessmen guzzling America 's fashionable liquors are driving prices up . It all points in one direction , if you believe the reports : to a catastrophic shortage of the world 's best whiskey and bourbon . <p> Devotees can take heart , however , in the knowledge that distillers have taken heed -- and are in the middle of a years-long expansion designed to ensure that no lover of brown liquors goes thirsty . <p> With a spike in popularity of American whiskey and bourbon since the 1990s , distillers have acted to protect themselves from cycles of boom and bust . The industry 's worst-case scenario is not a shortage but a repeat of the 1980s : demand will suddenly drop and distilleries ' investments will mean huge stockpiles of unsold bottles and waiting barrels . <p> Fears of a bourbon or whiskey shortage persist , however , because of the years of aging the products require -- four to seven for many bourbons , 12 years for single-malt scotch , 23 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oil industry , distillers try to estimate demand not for next year but for 10 and 20 years in the future , and to invest in and age their products accordingly . <p> In the ' 80s and ' 90s , distillers struggled to sell bourbon and whiskey alongside vodka and rum in a culture split between cocktails , beer and wine . With old stock just waiting on the shelves -- bourbon and whiskey do n't age once they 've been bottled -- prices plummeted , and not coincidentally bourbon and whiskey sales surged in the 2000s . Those who forecast a shortage believe distillers will start to run out as their pre-popularity investments fail to keep pace with post-popularity demand . <p> The industry 's worst-case scenario is a repeat of the 1980s : demand will suddenly drop and distilleries ' investments will mean huge stockpiles of unsold bottles and waiting barrels . Photograph : Cephas Picture Library / Alamy/Alamy <p> But even should demand flag here in the US , the international market shows no signs that it 's tiring of bourbon and whiskey , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Brown-Forman announced it would invest $135m to expand production of Jack Daniels and Woodford Reserve ; Diageo , the maker of Johnnie Walker , said it will invest about $115m over three years for its Kentucky operations . <p> And while the oldest whiskey will disappear off shelves at exorbitant prices , stores will still have the majority of mid-range bottles to stock , and any shortage wo n't last long . In 2013 , the home of 95% of the world 's bourbon production , Kentucky , filled 1.2m barrels of bourbon and inventory exceeded five million barrels . Some of that bourbon will be ready for consumption as soon as 2015 , and distilleries can plan how many barrels they 'll age according to how demand fluctuates over the years . <p> Importantly -- and despite what big distilleries may say -- age does not equal quality , and as in the wine industry , a subculture has spent centuries debating the merits of taste . Small distilleries selling " craft " or " artisanal " liquors have enjoyed the rising tide of whiskey 's popularity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the market busts even slightly . Established companies like Jack Daniels can afford to be careful with their prices and how they age barrels . Maker 's Mark is distributed " on allocation " around the states to ensure sales , and bourbons like Buffalo Trace 's Weller remain in steady circulation even as demand increases . <p> The worst threat to whiskey drinkers probably comes from their favorite libation 's increasing popularity . Cheaper and more unsavory competitors can dilute the market with poor quality drinks , and some brands choose not to put an exact age on their labels , hiding from consumers just exactly what they 're buying . Distillers like Buffalo Trace , maker of the legendarily rare Pappy Van Winkle , gladly play off shortages for marketing purposes -- their premium brands are selling at a 20% increase and they themselves put out a statement about " a shortage with no end in sight " in May . <p> For most people who enjoy a glass of bourbon or whiskey , there 's little need to worry . Distilleries have invested so much in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely than too little , and if demand drops so will prices . As for a shortage or glut of product , major distilleries would survive , just as they did in the busts of the 1790s , the 1840s and 1980s . Variety would survive too , since companies like Beam Suntory now make not just Jim Beam but higher-end scotches and bourbons , like Knob Creek . <p> The only likely shortage at hand is for the oldest whiskeys that take more than 20 years to age and can evaporate from barrels -- but aficionados willing to pay thousands for rare old bottles have always played a game of " shortages " . As for the hoarders , they 're playing a game so long they themselves might not see an end to it .

Photograph : Tengku Bahar/AFP/Getty Images <p> The city of Portland , Oregon , has filed a suit to shut down taxi service Uber just days after the controversial company launched there . <p> The lawsuit , filed late Monday , was the latest in a series of woes for the taxi app firm . On Tuesday a judge in Madrid , Spain , ordered the company to close its operations as the court considers a suit filed by the Madrid Taxi Association . <p> The company launched its lower-cost UberX service in Portland on Friday even as city officials declared it illegal . Until then , Portland had been the largest US city without Uber 's service . <p> " Our main concern is public health and safety , " mayor Charlie Hales said in a statement announcing the lawsuit .

City commissioner Steve Novick said the city is prepared to issue civil and criminal penalties against Uber and its drivers for operating without required permits and inspections . <p> Portland prides itself on its progressive attitudes and city officials cited Uber 's " surge " pricing -- when the company can double or even triple fares during peak travel periods , -- and lack of facilities for disabled passengers as major concerns . <p> " If Uber thinks there should be no maximum price on what they charge Portlanders , they should make their case to the Portland city council , " Novick said .

@@4822234 <p> The victim of a miscarriage of justice has praised the students who investigated his case , after a historic ruling saw his murder conviction overturned on appeal thanks to the work of a team lead by Cardiff University . <p> Dwaine George , now aged 30 , was jailed for life in 2002 for the shooting of 18-year-old Daniel Dale in Manchester , and served 12 years behind bars on a life sentence before being freed last year . But on Tuesday top judges overturned his conviction , and praised the " diligent " work of law students who helped provide the evidence which they deemed made the conviction " no longer safe " . <p> George , who has always maintained his innocence , was helped by law students at Cardiff University working under the university 's Innocence Project , which investigates potential miscarriages of justice . Quashing his conviction today , one of the most senior judges in the country Sir Brian Leveson , said the it was " no longer safe " and praised " the work of the Innocence Project and Pro Bono Unit at Cardiff Law School , which took up the appellant 's case and pursued it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the 2001 killing of Dale , who was gunned down in Manchester days before he had been due to give evidence at Manchester crown court about the killing of his best friend . Paul Ward , 16 , had been stabbed to death in a street attack in the city earlier in the year . <p> The prosecution argued that George -- who denied all involvement -- and another man , Ryan Brown , had used a Walther PPK self-loading pistol to kill Dale . They presented evidence of a very small amount of gunshot residue found on a black Henri Lloyd hooded jacket found under the stairs at George 's home . <p> George 's first appeal failed in 2004 , but the Criminal Cases Review Commission ( CCRC ) referred the murder conviction to the court of appeal for a second time . The current appeal focused on new guidelines which cast doubt on using small particles of gunshot residue as evidence . Students contacted Dennis McGuire , a US-based gunshot residue expert , who provided the basis for the students ' technical submissions . In his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goss , Leveson pointed to new guidelines on firearms residue issued by the Forensic Science Service ( FSS ) in 2006 , two years after George 's conviction . If the new guidelines were followed " the number and type of particles of residue found on the coat were so small so as to be at or near the level at which they could not be considered to have evidential value , " according to the judgment . If the judge at the original trial had access to the new guidelines his directions to the jury " would have been couched in terms of much greater circumspection and caution , " it added . <p> In a statement George thanked students , professors and pro-bono lawyers for securing the overturning of his conviction , " First and foremost , my thoughts go out to Daniel Dale 's family .

The university is one of a number of higher education institutions that work on cases of potential miscarriages of justice . Prof Julie Price , who runs the Cardiff project with Dr Dennis Eady , said university students had worked for " hundreds of hours " on the case over a four year period and the fact that it was the first case to be overturned with the help of an innocence project in nine years exposed serious flaws in the appeal process .

@@4822235 <p> George Osborne came under fire on Tuesday from a leading thinktank for sanctioning huge tax giveaways that forced the government to impose deeper than expected cuts on vital welfare budgets and Whitehall spending . <p> The Institute for Fiscal Studies said the coalition government made " remarkable choices " to cut income and corporation tax that shifted the burden of balancing the budget to already hard-hit areas of government spending . <p> IFS director Paul Johnson said the move had also limited the Treasury 's scope for bringing Britain 's mounting debts under control . <p> " Those are remarkable choices , as it were , in the context of the deficit reduction that you have got , and therefore the spending cuts that you have got .

Then for another 23 years he lay in a museum store until a chance conversation between two archaeologists led to the piecing together of his story : a man who died of a slashing sword wound and was buried holding his dagger , the oldest bronze object ever found in Britain and one of the oldest in Europe . <p> He was buried lying on his left side , with his hands clasping the dagger in front of his face . The dagger is an exceptionally rare type : the wooden hilt , long since rotted away , was ornamented with tiny studs , each a little masterpiece of ancient metalwork that when new would have gleamed like gold . <p> Its owner was a fighter : apart from the unhealed sword slash near his elbow which probably caused him to bleed to death -- the soil clinging to the bone proved that it was a raw gaping wound when he was buried -- he had another old sword injury near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been sharpened , proving it was no mere ceremonial object . <p> A view of the bronze dagger found with the skeleton known as Racton Man . Photograph : Gareth Fuller/PA <p> The results of scientific tests on his bones and teeth , just announced at the museum in Chichester where his remains are now on display , dated his dagger to 4,200 years ago , the earliest securely dated bronze object ever found in Britain . <p> The dagger was made in the dawn of bronze-working techniques , when metalsmiths in Britain learned from the continent how to alloy their copper with West Country tin and make a far harder and more beautiful metal . Within a few decades bronze had almost wiped out copper work , used for vessels and ornaments as well as weapons , which could be sharpened to a murderous edge . <p> " Dagger burials of any kind are rare , and these daggers are hens ' teeth rare , it was a very short-lived fashion , certainly no more than a few generations , " Stuart Needham , formerly of the British Museum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " To find one with the skeleton , giving it a secure and such an early date , makes it a find of national and indeed European importance . " <p> Racton Man was named for the hamlet near Chichester , where his dagger was first found by a metal detector in 1989 . James Kenny , now the archaeologist for Chichester district council , was one of the team who returned to the field and recovered the well-preserved skeleton and the tiny rivets that the detector had missed . He knew it was an important find , but there was no money for post-excavation work , so he wrote a report , and the skeleton and dagger went into the museum stores . <p> Then two years ago he and Needham were walking in another Sussex field where a small hoard had been found , and Kenny told him of his best find , so long ago . <p> The two went to look at the bones and the dagger in the stores , and Needham 's excitement grew .

To have owned such a high-status object he must have been a leader , possibly a tribal chieftain , but he also stood six foot tall , and had lived into his late 40s , much longer than the average life expectancy . <p> Isotope analysis of one of his teeth showed he had not come from the chalk downland of Sussex but from the West Country or just possibly Ireland or Brittany . <p> The copper in the bronze was also a rare type in Britain known as arsenic-only copper , which may have been specially prized because , although they could n't have understood the chemistry , the higher the arsenic content the harder the eventual bronze .

It is these days accepted , in a way that it was n't then , that decent people might have respectable concerns about pressure on space and services . <p> Unable to call for unrestricted inward migration any more , a few politicians and commentators have had to adopt alternative ways of brandishing their cosmopolitan credentials . Savaging a man who is no longer here to gainsay them is one way to do so . <p> So , was Enoch right ? Well , on the issue which we 're all now supposed to judge him by , no . He feared , as others did during the 1960s , that mass immigration would lead to social breakdown ; and his fears were , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tiber did not foam with much blood . Neither , closer to home , did the Rivers Tame or Trent . Britain succeeded in integrating an unprecedented number of settlers without major unrest . That 's not to say that there were no problems but , by and large , the country was able to enlarge its sense of what national identity meant . To this day , foreign visitors remark on how well Britain functions as a multiracial society . We do n't have to look far abroad for less happy examples . <p> On the two big issues of his day , though , he was dead right . First , he grasped , long before other politicians , that the post-war corporatist consensus was unsustainable , and that Britain was on the road to inflation , stagnation and debt . The Thatcherism that was seen as almost impossibly bold and radical in the late 1970s had been on his agenda since the late 1950s . He , as much as anyone , taught that creed to the rest of his party . <p> Second -- again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now the European Union was not a trade arrangement but a political project incompatible with full parliamentary democracy . <p> Of course , these causes are still not universally popular ; but they are now close to the consensus whereas , when he first took them up , they were so eccentric as to appear deranged . <p> The constant of Enoch Powell 's career was precisely his constancy . A master logician , he sometimes followed the arrow-flight of his logic to implausible places . Yet there is no doubting his brilliance . This is the man who , as a 17-year-old translating a passage from Bede into classical Greek for his Cambridge scholarship exam , found the task so easy that , to fill the allotted time , he translated it into Platonic , then Herodotean , then Ionic Greek , and then annotated it . This was the youngest professor in the Empire , the youngest Brigadier in the British Army , a master of several ancient and modern languages , the greatest parliamentary orator of his age . <p> Fewer and fewer people remember any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he first made his name as an MP , namely his championing of the right of Kenyan insurgents to the full protection of the British laws that they were fighting to throw off . Fifty-five years on , his speech about the Mau Mau terrorists who had been tortured seems uncannily apt to our present discontents : <p> " It has been said -- and it is a fact -- that these 11 men were the lowest of the low ; subhuman was the word which one of my honourable Friends used . So be it . But that can not be relevant to the acceptance of responsibility for their death . In general , I would say that it is a fearful doctrine , which must recoil upon the heads of those who pronounce it , to stand in judgment on a fellow human being and to say , ' Because he was such-and-such , therefore the consequences which would otherwise flow from his death shall not flow . ' <p> " Nor can we ourselves pick and choose where and in what parts of the world we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not say , ' We will have African standards in Africa , Asian standards in Asia and perhaps British standards here at home . ' We have not that choice to make . We must be consistent with ourselves everywhere . " <p> All this is gone now , lost in time like tears in rain . What remains is a name with which to , if not quite frighten children , at least bludgeon opponents . <p> Yet , oddly enough , Enoch Powell was keenly interested in turning theories into policy . His close friend and executor , Richard Ritchie , wrote yesterday that Enoch Powell would not have backed Ukip because he would have seen that party as , paradoxically , an obstacle in the path of securing a parliamentary majority for a referendum on leaving the EU . On that matter too , tragically , I suspect Enoch was right . 
@@4838239 <p> Ignore the economists quibbling whether public spending is returning to the era of George Orwell . If you want to see the future of your local public services , it 's already here : in the north London suburb of Barnet . I visited last week -- and it 's not pretty . <p> Not that there 's anything wrong with the area . I 've known Barnet forever ; it has provided me with countless walks , and the odd Saturday job . It remains the home of Jewish grandmothers holding forth on both Keynesianism and why you have n't finished your supper , and second-hand record shops run by greying Don Quixotes . <p> But what 's fast changing in Barnet is how residents access their local services -- everything from parking tickets to paying council tax to how their corpses are disposed of . In the past few years , the Tory-run council has taken almost every public service it can lay its hands on -- and outsourced it . <p> Between January 2012 and October 2013 , Barnet farmed out its care for people with disabilities , legal services , cemeteries and crematoriums , IT , finance , HR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management of council housing , environmental health , procurement , parking , and the highways department . <p> This evening , a full council meeting will vote on whether to consider cuts and " alternative delivery models " for another tranche of services , including libraries , rubbish collection , street gritters and children 's speech therapy , among others . Should they go the way of the rest and be outsourced , the local Unison branch calculates that Barnet council will shrink from having 3,200 staff in September 2012 to just 332 . <p> That is one hell of a municipal disappearing act . Residents now find it easier to list what their council does n't directly provide than what it does . Which means that if you want to see what the next five years of cuts hold for your local services -- whether David Cameron or Ed Miliband get in will make little odds for town halls -- you 'd best pay close attention to what Barnet is doing . <p> And a tour of the neighbourhood teaches you that when cuts reach a certain magnitude , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an entire democratic institution . Residents can show you lots of missing services : the borough is right now consulting on plans to squeeze the vast majority of libraries to around 540 sq ft , or the size of a Hampstead Garden Suburb living room . <p> But the really big change is that the new-model commissioning council is no longer a local arm of government but an agglomeration of mostly privately provided services . And the two biggest contracts , worth around ? 500m and lasting 10 years apiece , have gone to Capita . The ? 7bn FTSE 100 giant now handles everything from council tax collection to new roads . <p> For those who live and work in Barnet , their local affairs are now handled remotely by people hundreds of miles away , who know nothing about them or the area . Payroll for what remains of council staff is done in Belfast , while for schools it 's Carlisle . Pension queries go to Darlington . Benefits end up in Blackburn . Parking notices come from Croydon . Calls to the local library are first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are managed in Brent . <p> Got a complaint ? Then you have speak to someone you 'll never see -- that is , if you can speak to them at all . Capita has admitted previously " capping " phone calls : throwing callers off the line when things get too busy . So rather than rely on their local institutions , residents increasingly depend on their councillors to intercede . <p> A Labour councillor , Paul Edwards , has just finished a case for a woman who wanted to pay for a bench to be installed on a local hill in her parents ' name : what should have been an easy bequest ran aground on the confusion of a call centre employee who knew nothing about either the hill or how to handle such gifts . Edwards also recalls the sick woman whose council tax arrears had been overestimated by thousands -- but whose outsourced case worker was n't interested in discussing the issue . It went to court , and the woman won , at a huge cost both to her own mental health and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Barnet residents are stuck with them . Those two Capita deals , for instance , will carry on for at least the next decade , with many of their details shrouded in " commercial sensitivity " . Whoever locals vote for in the next two council elections , they will get Capita . And given that the local authority is now shedding its own staff , winding down its own IT systems and moving out of its offices , it 's hard to see how any new administration could take back control even if it wanted to . <p> The rationale for all this outsourcing is to save money -- a million pounds a month , claims council leader Richard Cornelius . He rightly points out that lots of other authorities are now following Barnet 's lead : just last month , Tory-run Northamptonshire declared it would outsource 95% of its work and go down to a skeleton staff . <p> So , a case of cutting coats according to cloth ? Two snags with that argument . First , the outsourcing proposals were first floated by local Tories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Second , these deals are always touted as saving money , and they rarely do . <p> Dexter Whitfield , an economist , points to Sefton , in Merseyside , which launched an outsourcing deal with Capita in 2008 . It was meant to deliver ? 70m savings and 100 new jobs . When neither unicorn materialised , the contract was transferred back to the council last year . <p> Meanwhile , the costs of the outsourcing are already being felt by the likes of Tony and Janet Solomons . Their son , Benjy , has severe learning disabilities and can neither walk nor talk . He attends a local day centre , where he gets close personal attention from " excellent , remarkable " staff . But the service was outsourced a couple of years ago , with some fantasy business model . <p> When it promptly collapsed , careworkers were hit with a near-10% pay cut . Employees I spoke to reported " morale on the floor " ; one former care assistant admitted to taking on two more jobs to make up the shortfall . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and employees under stress , are bound to affect Benjy 's level of care . <p> " How will a new agency worker understand his routines , or when he wants to go to the toilet ? " asks Janet . Yet Benjy ca n't report back , and his parents will never know for sure what 's happened . Unknowable , unaccountable and potentially costly : a stark metaphor for Barnet 's outsourcing regime .

@@4841231 <p> With the festive season underway , and work on the Bedales Christmas theatre production in full swing , it was something of a wrench for me to put things on hold for a meeting of independent school drama teachers in London a few weeks ago . <p> I found myself discussing the importance of drama and the reforms to GCSE and A-levels to be introduced next year . The government is stressing the need to prepare students for further and higher education , as well as employment , so they want to downgrade assessed coursework in favour of end-of-course exams . <p> The nature of reforms for drama at GCSE and A-level appear rather vague at the moment . Assessment objectives suggest that fewer complete texts will be studied , but more extracts , and at neither level is there any stipulation that students should see live theatre . On this latter point , my colleagues and I agree this should be remedied or we risk an over-reliance on video . <p> Although I am heartened by the growing sense that the qualification reforms will retain a significant proportion of non-examined assessment , clarification is needed about what " exam " means . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a formal sit-down test may not capture the subject 's value . <p> While preparation for work and higher study are important , it 's vital not to lose sight of the value of drama in itself , or the ways it is already in step with what educationalists and employers say they want . <p> All drama teachers are familiar with suggestions that drama is a soft subject . I am cushioned from this to some extent : the school is deeply committed to the liberal arts . We have a wonderful home for drama in our modern timber-framed theatre , and are more than happy to share what we have , making the theatre available to the local Petersfield youth theatre among other things . But I have done my share of trying to persuade headteachers about the academic and workplace benefits of drama -- of which there are plenty . <p> Theatre both demands and displays teamwork in compelling ways . This Christmas we are staging German playwright Bertolt Brecht 's " The Caucasian Chalk Circle " -- a difficult choice due to the interwoven nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be largely student-led . A public performance such as this can be a wonderful shop window for the school , bringing to life claims about inclusiveness , learning that engages , and valuing the talents of the individual . <p> Not only can children draw upon other subject areas to inform what they do in drama , for example , in researching roles , but drama can also help those earmarked as disengaged find something in school for themselves . I can think of many students about whom teachers in other subjects have expressed concerns that they do n't contribute in class , who then learn through drama that they can say their piece . It is immensely gratifying when this new confidence transfers to their other subjects . When heads agree to come and take a look at performances , they are struck by just how excited children can become in an educational environment . <p> It is also hard to find a subject that has a stronger focus on the quality of the end result : there will be a performance , it must be well researched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A theatre production is a management project ; my time working in management in the city , prior to becoming a drama teacher , made me aware of the qualities needed to shine . Management projects in the workplace require bringing people together quickly and enthusiastically , and the teamwork and leadership engendered in drama work are suited to this . <p> A drama education is excellent preparation for all kinds of employment , and it is now common knowledge that the skills taught on a drama degree are much respected by employers in a range of fields . It can be no coincidence that at Bedales , in all the years that I have been here , the head boy or girl teams have been made up of a minimum of 50% drama students or those who have taken on leading roles in the school plays . <p> Drama engenders joy , enthusiasm and a sense of achievement in students , it really should blossom because there 's nothing like it . @ @ @ @

He plants his front foot , using a big forward press , which is fine in Test cricket because it helps you defend , but in one-day cricket it makes you static . You ca n't move again and force the bowler to change his length . The best players of spin use their feet so they can sweep and cut . Cook ca n't do that .

" Fideles " are Catholic revolutionaries , " Bethlehem " is the true church in captivity and " Natum videte , regem angelorum " is a pun : Christ was born king of the angels , but the Young Pretender was born king of the English . <p> All of which is so subtle that it 's no wonder that the stolid Hanoverians , by now ensconced in place of the flighty Stuarts , never spotted the double entendres . " Adeste Fideles " was absorbed smoothly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became a Protestant tub-thumper . First the words and then the music were changed to something more bracingly English . Where once the faithful minuetted into Bethlehem in 3/4 time , now they approached at a brisk 4/4 march . <p> Give or take the fact that it might be written in code , " O Come All Ye Faithful " is easy to follow . It takes us through the liturgical meaning of the nativity sequence , ending with that most thrillingly literal verse : " Yea Lord we greet thee/ Born this happy morning . " Most carols are much more of a jumble , having picked up all sorts of non sequiturs along the way . " I Saw Three Ships " , for instance , started in Aberdeen and travelled via Kent , hence the way Bethlehem has mysteriously acquired a coastline . In " The Holly and the Ivy " we leap awkwardly from the pagan evergreens to the distinctly churchy " playing of the merry organ " , which suggests that someone had a go at Christianising it along the way . What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no matter what metrical and musical contortions you try . <p> But when it came to creative fiddling , the Victorian Anglo-Catholics were the past masters . Determined to add a dash of medieval mystery to the brash beat of militant Protestantism , they invented an archaic language that was about as authentic as a pointy spire by George Gilbert Scott or a wimple from William Morris . " Good my page " could indeed just as easily be " my good page " , while in " The Angel Gabriel Came Down " , the line " for known a blessed mother thou shalt be " is simply a bit of Victorian whimsy about how people spoke in the olden days . " Ding Dong Merrily " , meanwhile , is a treasure chest of made-up gibberish : " swungen " and " sungen " are just about credible as Old English borrowings , but it 's difficult to imagine any self-respecting peasant singing " Ding Dong " in whatever century he was supposed to be capering . <p> All of which makes it doubly confusing to learn that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older form , it pleased no one . Charles Wesley 's original opening line for " Hark the Herald Angels Sing " was " Hark how all the welkin rings " .

Yet when Ralph Vaughan Williams , that tireless restorer of ancient musical forms , tried to get people to harken to the welkin in the early 20th century , they were appalled . It sounded ridiculous , if not slightly disgusting , as if the congregation was being asked to attend to a rudely shaped vegetable . <p> * To buy Christmas Carols : From Village Green to Church Choir for ? 7.99 ( RRP ? 9.99 ) go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846.

In the summer , ships glide around Stockholm 's archipelago , which makes up just a handful of its 30,000 islands . At this time of year , it 's the perfect winter wonderland . The people are beautiful , everything is perfectly designed , and pickled herring is everywhere . But these are n't the only things that define the city . In the last few years , Stockholm has become one of the most talked-about places in the world thanks to its apps , games and digital services . <p> Stockholm 's technology industry helped to attract ? 109m ( ? 85m ) of investment into Sweden in 2009 .

There are 30 tech unicorns in Europe , and with 11 , London has the most . But our capital also has a population of 8m . Stockholm has just under 790,000 inhabitants . So , how has the city come to punch so far above its weight ? <p> Tyler Crowley is an American business consultant who moved to the city in 2012 . He talks in baking metaphors . A successful tech city is like a cake , he tells me . Stockholm has great " ingredients " for success , he says . This includes having an excellent and free education available to all ( which he says produces good " chefs " ) . <p> Thanks to the Swedish government investing in high-speed internet in the 1990s , Sweden 's citizens are also super connected .

It now accounts for more than a third of all online sales in Sweden , and processes 200,000 transactions a day . " When I was young my family could n't afford a computer , " says Siemiatkowski . " But because of this subsidy we could , and from the age of 10 I was always playing around with it . It was very visionary of the politicians back then .

" It would have been impossible to consider going out on our own and going months without a salary , if it was n't for the daycare system , " she says . These policies have been in place some years . It 's only in the last two , though , that Stockholm has come into its own . This has been helped by the fact it now has its own personal identity , in the same way San Francisco has Silicon Valley . <p> " The things that were missing were the hashtag and brand for the community , " says Crowley .

" We would never have two floors in our office , " one co-founder tells me , " as it would create too much of a hierarchy " . <p> Stockholm is punching above its weight when it come to so-called ' unicorn ' businesses ( Rex Features ) <p> Even though they could easily afford to , Jantelagen also extends to pay . Not only do the city 's tech staff get paid less than those in other countries , but there 's also less disparity between roles . The firm Truecaller , which allows its 100m users to search for phone numbers , has received ? 50m of investment in five years .

And upon the sale of Mojang to Microsoft , an employee tweeted " Limousine to Bromma airport , private jet to Cannes , Ferrari to Hotel de Paris in Monte Carlo . " This sort of boasting is anathema to most Swedes . <p> The reluctance to brag in Stockholm can also come across as a lack of confidence to investors . But STHLMTECH 's Crowley says he 's been cooking up a solution . He has put together workshops to help Swedish tech execs to appear less humble .

@@4844234 <h> If life had originated twice , independently , within our solar system , we 'd have to conclude that it ca n't be a rare fluke , says Martin Rees . <p> More than 100 years ago , a French foundation offered the grand prize of 100,000 francs to anyone who could prove the existence of extraterrestrial life . But there was an important proviso . Finding life on Mars did n't count : that was deemed to be far too easy . Indeed , in the 19th century an eccentric American astronomer , Percival Lowell , had claimed to see " canals " on Mars , indicative of large-scale irrigation by an advanced civilisation . <p> Scientists are now far more dubious about the ubiquity of life than their counterparts in earlier centuries -- the great astronomer William Herschel , for instance , thought the Moon , and even the Sun , was inhabited . But Mars , the Red Planet , has always seemed the best bet -- and indeed it is still the most fascinating and Earth-like planet in our Solar System . <p> We now know for certain , of course , that there are no Martians of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provoke a " War of the Worlds " . But the existence of even the most primitive life on Mars would in itself be hugely interesting to scientists . <p> It would also have broader cosmic implications . If life had originated twice , independently , within our solar system , we 'd have to conclude that it ca n't be a rare fluke -- and that the wider cosmos must teem with life , on zillions of planets orbiting other stars . But until we find life on Mars ( or maybe on the moons of Jupiter or Saturn , or on a comet ) it remains possible that life is very rare and special to our Earth . <p> That is why even the most tentative claims for life on Mars attract huge interest . This week there has been one such claim , reported by The Telegraph yesterday , that underground methane is " burping " through the Martian surface -- possibly generated by organic stuff that was once alive . Let 's hope that future experiments can clarify this . It will certainly add interest to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planned for 2016 , and will be able to dig deep below the surface of the Red Planet . <h> Related Articles <p> But I suspect what really drives our interest in Mars is the thought that one day , human beings may tread the Red Planet 's surface ourselves . We are getting used to the idea of robots achieving superhuman feats in space -- it was the Curiosity rover that recorded these methane levels , and it came just weeks after the Rosetta probe landed on a comet -- but there is still a desire to see humans play a role . As a scientist or practical man , I see little purpose in sending people into space at all . But as a human being , I 'm an enthusiast for manned missions .

Prospects here are far brighter . We 've learnt something that makes the night sky far more interesting than it was to our forbears . Many stars -- perhaps even most -- are orbited by retinues of planets , just like the Sun is . <p> These planets are not detected directly but inferred by carefully observing their parent star -- detecting the wobble in its motion induced by an orbiting planet 's gravity , or the slight dimming when a planet transits in front if it . <p> The next generation of telescopes , however , will be able to image planets the size of our Earth , orbiting other Sun-like stars .

Science fiction writers have other ideas -- balloon-like creatures floating in the dense atmospheres of Jupiter-like planets , swarms of intelligent insects , nanoscale robots etc . Perhaps life can flourish even on a planet flung into the frozen darkness of interstellar space , whose main warmth comes from internal radioactivity ( the process that heats the Earth 's core ) . There could be diffuse living structures , freely-floating in interstellar clouds ; such entities would live ( and , if intelligent , think ) in slow motion , but nonetheless may come into their own in the long-range future . <p> We should also be mindful that seemingly artificial signals could come from super-intelligent ( though not necessarily conscious ) computers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already died out . <p> Maybe we will one day find ET .

And the first interstellar voyagers from Earth would have a mission that would resonate through the entire galaxy and perhaps beyond . <p> Martin Rees is the Astronomer Royal and a Fellow of Trinity College Cambridge 
@@4844235 <p> Hi . I 'm Jo . You may remember me . You may even have filmed me . On Friday , you staged a publicity stunt at an RBS office , inconveniencing a hundred or so people . I was the lanky slouched guy with a lot less hair than you but ( I flatter myself ) a slightly better beard who complained to you that you , a multimillionaire , had caused my lunch to get cold . You started going on at me about public money and bankers ' bonuses , but look , Russell , anyone who knows me will tell you that my food is important to me , and I had n't had breakfast that morning , and I 'd been standing in the freezing cold for half an hour on your whim . What mattered to me at the time was n't bonuses ; it was my lunch , so I said so . <p> Which is a great shame , because I 'd usually be well up for a proper barney with you , and the points you made do actually deserve answers . Although not -- and I really ca n't emphasise this enough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Before I go any further , I should stress that I do n't speak for RBS . I 'm not even an RBS employee , though I do currently work for them . What follows is not any sort of official statement from RBS , or even from the wider banking industry . It is merely the voice of a man whose lunch on Friday was unfairly delayed and too damn cold . <p> So , firstly , for the people who were n't there , let 's describe the kerfuffle . I did n't see your arrival ; I just got back from buying my lunch to discover the building 's doors were locked , a film crew were racing around outside trying to find a good angle to point their camera through the windows , and you were in reception , poncing around like you were Russell bleeding Brand .

Did you think a pack of traders might gallop through reception , laughing maniacally as they threw burning banknotes in the air , quaffing champagne , and brutally thrashing the ornamental paupers that they keep on diamante leashes -- and you , Russell , would damningly catch them in the act ? But that 's on Tuesdays . I get it , Russell , I do : footage of being asked to leave by security is good footage . It looks like you 're challenging the system and the powers that be want your voice suppressed . Or something .

" <p> Getty Images <p> Of course , Russell , I have no idea whether you could get an appointment . Maybe RBS top brass would rather not talk to you . That 's their call -- and , you know , some of your behaviour might make them a tad wary . Reputations are very important in banking , and , reputation-wise , hanging out with a guy who was once fired for broadcasting hardcore pornography while off his head on crack is not ideal . But surely a man who can get invited onto Question Time to discuss the issues of the day with our Lords @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banker . And it would be great if you could . Have you tried , Russell ? Maybe you could do an interview with one of them . An expert could answer your questions and rebut your points , and you could rebut right back at them . I might even watch that . ( By the way , Russell , if you do , and it makes money , I would like a cut for the idea , please . And I 'm sure it would . Most things you do make money . ) <p> But instead of doing something potentially educational , Russell , you staged a completely futile publicity stunt . You turned up and were n't allowed in . Big wow . You know what would have happened if a rabid capitalist had just turned up unannounced ? They would n't have been allowed in either . You know what I have in my pocket ? A security pass . Unauthorised people are n't allowed in . Obviously . That 's not a global conspiracy , Russell ; it 's basic security . Breweries have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conspiring to steal beer from the poor . And security really matters : banks are simply crawling with highly sensitive information . Letting you in because you 're a celebrity and You Demand Answers could in fact see the bank hauled in front of the FCA . That would be a scandal . Turning you away is not . I 'm sorry , Russell , but it 's just not . <p> Your response to my complaint that a multimillionaire was causing my lunch to get cold was ... well , frankly , it was to completely miss the point , choosing to talk about your millions instead of addressing the real issue , namely my fucking lunch . But that 's a forgivable mistake . We all have our priorities , Russell , and I can understand why a man as obsessed with money as I am with food would assume that 's what every conversation is about . Anyway , you said that all your money has been made privately , not through taxation . Now , that , Russell , is actually a fair point . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you have no qualms about appearing on the BBC in return for money raised through one of the most regressive taxes in the country , a tax which leads to crippling fines and even jail time for thousands of poor people and zero rich people . But never mind . I appreciate that it 's difficult for a celeb to avoid the BBC , even if they 're already a multimillionaire and can totally afford to turn the work down . Ah , the sacrifices we make to our principles for filthy lucre , eh , Russell ? The condoms and hairspray wo n't buy themselves . Or , in my case , the pasta . <p> And then there is that film you 're working on , is n't there , for which I understand your production company is benefitting from the Enterprise Investment Scheme , allowing the City investors funding your film to avoid tax . Was that the film you were making on Friday , Russell , when you indignantly pointed out to me that none of your money comes from the taxpayer ? Perhaps it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 've been in a few Hollywood films now , have n't you , Russell ? I take it you 've heard of Hollywood Accounting ? Of course you have , Russell ; you produced Arthur . So you are well aware that Hollywood studios routinely cook their books to make sure their films never go into taxable profit -- for instance , Return Of The Jedi has never , on paper , made a profit . Return Of The fucking Jedi , Russell . As an actor , and even more so as the producer of a ( officially ) loss-making film , you 've taken part in that , you 've benefitted from it . ( While we 're on the subject , I hear great things about Hollywood 's catering . I hope you enjoyed it . Expensive , delicious , and served ( at least when I dream about it ) nice and hot . ) <p> But still , you 're broadly right . Leaving aside the money you make from one of the most regressive of the UK 's taxes , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give you more money , and the huge fees you 've accepted from one of the planet 's most notorious and successful tax avoidance schemes , you , Russell , have come by your riches without any effect on taxpayers . Whereas RBS got bailed out . Fair point . <p> Here 's the thing about the bailout of RBS , Russell : it 's temporary . The plan was never to bail out a bank so that it could then go bust anyway . That would be too asinine even for Gordon Brown . The idea was to buy the bank with public money , wait until it became profitable again , then resell it , as Alastair Darling clearly explained at the time . And that is still the plan , and it does appear to be on course . Not only that , but it looks as if the government will eventually sell RBS for more than they bought it for . In other words , the taxpayer will make a profit on this deal . <p> Of all the profligate pissing away of public money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the public are actually going to get their money back seems an odd target for your ire . What other government spending can you say that about , Russell ? What other schemes do they sink taxpayers ' money into and get it all back , with interest ? And how many people have you met who have actually been right in the middle of working to make a profit for the taxpayer when you 've interrupted them to cause their lunch to get cold ? <p> As for bonuses , well , I 'll be honest : I get an annual bonus . I 'm not allowed to tell you exactly how much it is , but I will say it 's four or five orders of magnitude smaller than the ones that make the headlines . It 's very nice -- helps pay off a bit of credit card debt ( remember debt , Russell ? ) -- but , to put it in terms you can understand , I 'd need to work for several tens of thousands of years before my bonuses added up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the key thing you need to know about bonuses , Russell : they come with conditions attached . My salary is mine to do with as I will ( I like to spend a chunk of it on good hot food ) . My bonus my employer can take back off me under certain conditions . Again , I do not speak for RBS , so can not say anything about the recent FX trading scandal or PPI or any of that shit . But , in general terms , bonuses have conditions attached , such as " And we 'll claw back every penny if we discover you were breaking the rules . " And yes , it does happen . The only bonuses that make the news are the ones that get paid . But , every year , bonuses either do n't get paid or are even taken back off staff for various reasons , including misconduct . I 'd 've thought , Russell , that anyone who wanted bankers to be accountable would approve of the scheme . <p> And now , if I may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I disagree with most of your politics , I 've always rather liked you . You do a good job of coming across as someone who might be fun to be around . Turns out , that 's an illusion . <p> Because , you see , Russell , when you accosted me , you started speaking to me with your nose about two inches from mine . That 's pretty fucking aggressive , Russell . I 'm sure you 're aware of the effect . Putting one 's face that close to someone else 's and staring into their eyes is how primates square off for a fight . Regardless of our veneer of civilisation , when someone does that to us , it causes instinctive physical responses : adrenaline , nervousness ... back down or lash out . ( Or , apparently , in the case of the celebrity bikes you like to hang out with , swoon . ) I 'm sure that , like turning up with a megaphone instead of an appointment , such an aggressive invasion of personal space makes for great footage : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone of yours , and they react with anger . Makes them look unreasonable . Makes it look like they 're the aggressive ones . Makes it look like people get flustered in the face of your incisive argument . When in fact they 're just getting flustered in the face of your face . <p> I 've been thinking about this the last couple of days , Russell , and I can honestly say that the only other people ever to talk to me the way you did were school bullies . It 's been nearly a quarter of a century since I had to deal with such bastards , so I was caught quite off my guard . Nice company you 're keeping . Now I think about it , they used to ruin my lunchtimes too . <p> One last thing , Russell . Who did you inconvenience on Friday ? Let 's say that you 're right , and that the likes of Fred Goodwin need to pay . OK , so how much trouble do you think Fred faced last Friday as a result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got cold , Russell ? Even just his tea ? I somehow doubt it . How about some of the millionaire traders you despise so much ( some of whom are nearly as rich as you , Russell ) ? Well , no , because you got the wrong fucking building . ( Might want to have a word with your researchers about that . ) Which brings us back to where we came in : a bunch of admittedly fairly well paid but still quite ordinary working people , admin staff mostly , having their lives inconvenienced and , in at least one case , their lunches quite disastrously cooled , in order to accommodate the puerile self-aggrandising antics of a prancing multimillionaire . If you had any self-awareness beyond agonising over how often to straighten your fucking chest-hair , you 'd be ashamed . <p> It was paella , by the way . From Fernando 's in Devonshire Row .

' <p> The project was born more than a decade ago , Rosie told MailOnline . <p> ' We were lying on the grass together one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny plane " and I thought to myself no , that 's not a tiny plane , that 's an enormous plane . <p> ' It made me wonder how a child understands and decodes the world they find themselves inhabiting . <h> Share this article <p> ' How much do we presume that they just ' get ' ? At what point , what age , do they understand what is real , what is fake ? <p> ' I started to make a series of images that explored themes of scale , reality , perception , emotion - with Stanley in mind . <p> ' Crucially , I was wondering if everyone 's experience of a situation is the same as others . And how would we know if this was or was n't the case ? ' <p> What Rosie did not know then was that 18 months later her bright , joyful son would start to display behaviour that was at odds with his peers . <p> At three-and-a-half , Stanley was diagnosed with autism . <p> On that day , she embarked on a journey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eldest son . <p> ' How did life really feel for him and how did it differ from the life I experience , ' she said . <p> Recalling Stanley 's diagnosis , Rosie said : ' In 2001 , a year after Stanley was diagnosed , I was looking back at the first set of pictures , A Boy 's Eye View , and it struck me just how poignant and incredibly ironic those images were . <p> ' Tiny plane ' . A matter-of-fact statement from the mouth of a child , moments after he spots a 747 thundering through the skies miles above his head . To many , it is just that , a statement describing the here and now . But for the documentary photographer Rosie , the comment from 18-month-old son Stanley , as they lay in the grass 16 years ago , was to prove poignant <p> ' Stanley has difficulties with personal space , ' said Rosie . ' He does n't like people getting too close to him and will always wander off looking for his own space . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has finished and got down . Conversely , he will sometimes walk right up to children and speak to them with his nose practically touching theirs . Even the very youngest of them have an intuitive understanding of social codes and know something 's not right . He does n't , ' said Rosie <p> ' Stanley was indeed living in a very confusing world , much more complex , illogical and at times frightening than I could possibly understand . <p> ' And those same themes with which I 'd grappled at the outset are still very much part of Stanley 's world now that he is a young man . ' <h> ACCLAIM AND PRAISE FOR UNDERSTANDING STANLEY <p> Professor Simon Baron-Cohen , director of Autism Research Center at Cambridge University , said : ' Through this unique and remarkable photo-biography , Rosie Barnes lets us into the world of her son Stanley . <p> ' In doing this she acts as his voice , showing us what makes him happy , what interests him and what makes him stressed . <p> ' Most importantly this beautiful book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the autistic spectrum and their families . ' <p> Professor Uta Frith , cognitive neuroscientist and author of books on autism , said : ' I am full of admiration for this book ... a marvellous insight into autism . <p> ' Understanding Stanley says in pictures what can barely be said in words ... Rosie has managed to convey what I call the " The beautiful otherness of the autistic mind " . ' <p> An anonymous visitor to the exhibition in Frankfurt , Germany , said : Amazing . So very few questions and so many answers . ' <p> An anonymous visitor in Hereford , in the UK , added : ' Never had an insight like this into autism . Meaningful beyond measure . ' <p> And another visitor to the exhibition , in Hereford , added : ' Stunning , thought-provoking and more than that . <p> ' It really meant something and means something . The bit about feeling like an alien and wishing someone would take you home , I remember feeling like that . <p> ' It 's good that something like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do actually feel differently . ' <p> In Understanding Stanley - Looking Through Autism , the mother-of-two set out to build on the previous set of images and also to draw inspiration from the experiences of others . <p> She said she was mindful to include the insights of others . <p> The book gives a unique , moving and very accessible insight into Stanley 's world and that of others who are on the autism spectrum , young and old . <p> Autism is an incurable , developmental disorder that affects the individual 's ability to communicate and relate to others and the world around them . <p> It is a serious and disabling , lifelong condition . <p> A child on the autism spectrum will grow up to become an adult on the autism spectrum . <p> ' You may have seen many of the very positive TV shows about individuals with spectacular gifts and abilities and think it 's quite a " cool ' thing to have , ' Rosie said . ' This is true in a very tiny percentage of cases . <p> ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with autism find everyday life an exhausting and confusing struggle . <p> ' That 's not to say that it is a tragedy or indeed that they 'd like to be rid of their autism - because it makes them who they are . <p> ' It 's just that everyone living with autism needs understanding and acceptance , wherever they are on the spectrum . <p> ' It 's pretty commonplace these days , but that does n't make it any easier to be living with . <p> ' Obviously every child is different , but those affected do share similar characteristics . <p> ' Common areas where those on the autism spectrum appear different to their peers include communication , social interaction and general flexibility of thought , sometimes referred to as social imagination . <p> ' The fourth area , not often recognised , is having sensory experiences outside of the ' normal ' range , Rosie said . <p> This , she added , can ' hugely affect the first three ' . <p> ' It feels like I 'm trapped in a world where everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the autism spectrum <p> ' In fact , some would argue that the sensory issues can contribute to the other three to such an extent that sensory differences should be top of the list , ' she said . <p> ' For example , if you ca n't stand the buzz and glare of strip lighting you wo n't be able to go to a supermarket ; if you ca n't bare the smell of people you will avoid social situations . <p> ' All these four areas are crucially important . <h> WHAT IS AUTISM ? <p> Autism is a life-long developmental disability that affects how a person communicates with , and relates to , other people . <p> It also affects how they make sense of the world around them . <p> It is a spectrum condition , which means , while all people with autism share certain difficulties , their condition will affect them in different and unique ways . <p> Some people with autism are able to live relatively indepdendent lives , but others may have additional learning disabilites and need a lifetime of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just getting along with people , having relationships , being able to express yourself and make yourself understood , progressing through life , upholding your self-esteem , living independently , getting a job and just being able to cope with day to day life . ' <p> The devoted mother said all she wishes for Stanley is ' understanding and acceptance ' of his condition . <p> ' It is the essential foundation to build help and support upon , ' she said . ' It is precisely what I wish for Stanley . It is precisely what this book is about . ' <p> There are hundreds of books published about autism , Asperger 's ( Autistic Spectrum Disorders ) but the vast majority are heavy text books , that can be difficult to understand . <p> ' They are of immense value , ' Rosie said . <p> But she cautions that they are largely ' preaching to the converted ' , their readers already people with a good understanding of autism and an acceptance of the condition . <p> ' It 's everyone else out there with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the popcorn queue at the cinema with , who need help in understanding this highly complex and invisible condition , ' Rosie said . <p> ' These people will mostly never find the time or the inclination to sit down and read a text book about autism . I think we 're fundamentally missing something . ' <p> ' If I jump up and down on a train , I 'm in the same place , but everyone else has moved on , ' said one anonymous person on the autism spectrum quoted in the new book <p> Rosie said : ' Stanley needs a very clearly defined framework and fixed personal routines to keep him calm and happy . He seems suspended in this picture . Not swinging , but still and serene ' <p> ' There is a truth in the tale of The Ugly Duckling . If you are a swan and unrecognised as such , living with a duck family that thinks you are a duck , expects you to behave like a duck and at times might coerce you to be more like a duck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-esteem and the need to isolate yourself at the same time that you try not to be isolated . Indeed , if things get bad enough , you will eventually decide that further attempts at communication will only bring on more trouble , so you stop trying to communicate , ' said Bob Morris , on the autism spectrum <p> Her motivation in creating Understanding Stanley , was to ' create a new kind of visual language for autism ' , she reveals . <p> ' This is a quiet and peaceful book about autism , ' she said . ' A place to start that has space to breathe . Sometimes a lot of words are not where you need to begin . ' <p> Her aim - ' to get under the skin of what it might feel like to be autistic ' while asking little effort from the reader . <p> ' I am no expert , I am Stanley 's mum , but as a photographer I do know that pictures can resonate and stay with you in a way that text alone can not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast majority of people living with autism find everyday life an exhausting and confusing struggle <p> Rosie Barnes , Stanley 's mother <p> ' They can reach people at an emotional level , which is a far more important and powerful place to start . <p> ' I believe to convey even just a feeling of what this condition is like , may just help . <p> ' This is not a " what to do " book . It 's a " what it might feel like " book . <p> ' Knowledge and awareness of autism has come a long way , even in the past five years . <p> ' Most people by now have heard of it and recognise that it 's not all that uncommon , but when pressed , still do n't really get it . <p> ' Why ? Well , it 's incredibly complex , it 's completely invisible , the spectrum is extremely wide and as they say , " meet one person with autism and you 've met one person with autism " . <p> ' And autism is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on to create the autistic personality . <p> ' So many people had said to me , " Oh he 's OK is n't he , he 's only mildly affected " , or " he looks fine to me , you 'd never know " . The latter really struck me . <p> ' Yes he really does look fine , healthy and handsome . He certainly does n't look any different from any other child or young man . <p> ' There is no visible sign . No wheelchair , no hearing aid , nothing at all that will act as a clue to anyone who might be looking at him , judging him . <p> ' And because there 's nothing to " see " , then he is surely expected to be and act and communicate in a ' normal ' fashion . ' <p> But for Stanley , that is just not possible . <p> Sonia , a specialist autism teacher , said : ' Everyone is meant to know the rules in life for different situations . But there is no rule book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young people are left all at sea trying so hard to get things right but so often getting it wrong because there is no clear sign or they misread the signs because they appear distorted . And that can make them feel so stressed and so worthless . How awful to be thinking all the time that you 've got it wrong -- again . I ca n't begin to imagine how that must feel ' <h> BEAUTIFUL PICTURES CONVEY ' ALIENATING DIFFERENCES ' <p> President of the NAS , Jane Asher , said : ' Autism and its cousin Asperger 's Syndrome are extremely complex conditions and their effects can be very difficult to put across . <p> ' Even those affected themselves can find it almost impossible to explain how they feel . <p> ' Rosie 's pictures are not only beautiful works in their own right , but sensitively convey some of the alienating differences of perception that those with autism have to live with , and she manages to show us -- through some deceptively simple images -- just how much the rest of us take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around us . ' <p> ' They capture Stanley 's unique take on the world , but also Rosie 's journey as a mother , using her camera to document and understand her son 's autism . <p> ' Her search for knowledge , and the images that she has created , are brilliantly complemented by the quotes from people with autism . <p> ' Their words give added meaning to Rosie 's photography and offer an important insight into what a life with autism is really like . ' <p> ' His thought patterns , his way of communicating , his priorities can be quite different from those of his parents , and his brother , as well as his peers . <p> ' What someone on the spectrum considers interesting , important , beautiful , easy , fun and safe , can be at complete odds and is often in conflict with those people deemed ' neuro-typical ' , Rosie explained . <p> She said : ' These are the things you can not ' see ' . So , whatever you call it , ask anyone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing ' mild ' about it . <p> ' As a photographer and mother trying once again to understand her son from an entirely new and puzzling perspective , I set out to photograph his world again , to try to get under the skin of how life might be for him . <p> ' To explore and communicate in a new language , the differences in perception that those with autism have to live with on a daily basis . <p> ' But how do you make people aware and accepting of something so complex , so difficult to explain or understand , let alone see ? <p> ' How could I make the invisible visible ? How could I help people to feel , not just to think ? Understanding Stanley is my attempt . <p> ' So , if you 're the person who is sitting on the tube or standing at the bus stop next to Stanley tomorrow , I 'm hoping , having looked through this book , that you may not be frightened of his unusual behaviour ( he might be smiling to himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept him . <p> ' I 'm hoping that you might not get up and move to the next carriage , which could easily damage his already fragile self-esteem . <p> ' You could n't be in the company of someone who is less likely to hurt or offend you . <p> ' And I 'm hoping this book will also teach us something about ourselves - how much we take for granted in the way we interact with the world around us and how we should never make assumptions . <p> ' I very much believe that being autistic is not wrong , it is just a different way of experiencing life . I think it is absolutely OK to be different , but being different is definitely not easy . ' <p> Stanley is now nearly 18 and is at school close to the family home in South East London . <p> I very much believe that being autistic is not wrong , it is just a different way of experiencing life . I think it is absolutely OK to be different , but being different is definitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is proud of the book , has contributed to it and refers to it as ' our book ' . <p> Understanding Stanley has been endorsed by a variety of well known individuals from both the autism and photography world and is supported by the UK charities , The National Autistic Society and Ambitious About Autism . <p> ' With one in 68 of us now being diagnosed as on the autism spectrum , that figure represents a huge amount of people within our families , our schools , our places of work and our communities , who need our greater understanding and acceptance , ' Rosie said .

As Milan 's brands struggle to find a role in a world whose head no longer automatically turns to their labels , down the road in humble , agricultural , metal-bashing Modena it 's all kicking off . <p> And we 're not talking about that upstart Ferrari ( a business a mere 67 years old this year ) but Maserati , which has spent most of this year celebrating its centenary . Prematurely it seems as the actual date of incorporation of Societ ? Anonima Officine Alfieri Maserati was 1 December 1914 . Appropriately then a plaque was unveiled at the company 's original site and Maserati hosted a small and appealingly low key party earlier this month . <p> Maserati opened for business in Bologna , only moving to Modena after the company was bought out for what would prove to be the first of many times .

( Whisper it ; they say the Red Brigades used to meet here . ) <p> It 's below street level , down a ramp and hard to imagine how Alfieri , Ernesto , Ettore and Bindo ever got the cars they worked on in to the shop in the first place . Then again the first Ford Model Ts were built on the first floor of Henry 's building on Piquette Avenue . <p> The Maseratis did n't get around to building their own first car until 1926 , instead dedicating themselves to servicing , repairing and race-prepping others ' Alfa Romeos and Bugattis . But the boys continued to learn and the first car , the so-called Type 26 ( as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Targa Florio .

Maserati 's revival then did n't really begin until 1993 with the inevitable arrival on the scene of Fiat who first bounced control of Maserati to its Ferrari group in 1997 before moving it along again in 2005 to where it now sits with Alfa Romeo and Abarth . <p> And if that sounds like a turbulent 100 years it 's worth remembering that of the small group of surviving ultra-luxury carmakers - Rolls , Bentley , Aston , Lambo , Bugatti , Maserati and Ferrari - not one has had a smooth run at it with the possible exception of Ferrari ( and only then because of the old man 's prescience in doing the deal with Fiat ) . <p> And it 's worth remembering this also ; Maserati has never been so healthy ; from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on track to build 75,000 cars by 2017 . Much of that growth will come from the SUV the company will launch next year - the Levante - named after the company 's original Modena offices . <p> And if the notion of a Maserati SUV offends purists , take a look at the two-seat Alfieri coupe concept which will join the line up in 2017 alongside the latest Quattroporte , the extremely appealing Ghibli that 's driving the current growth and a replacement for the big two-plus-two Granturismo coupe . <p> The only downside possibly of Maserati 's turbulent relationship history is that it 's left with few of the chattels you might have expected to acquire in 100 not entirely inglorious years . Instead , those original premises belong to those Bolognese Reds , all the very early cars are gone ( to be fair Ferrari did the same with his first cars , cannibalising the first to make the second and so on ) and much of the remaining collection of historic cars with the Panini family ( yes , as in the football cards ) who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maserati wanted to lay on some classics for Telegraph Luxury to drive , it had to go cap-in-hand to owners . <p> But even this is n't a problem as brands should n't really belong to the companies that own them , but with the customers .

@@4861236 <p> A disappearing tradition : the school nativity play is a reminder of what Christmas means <p> December is traditionally a time of great joy for the Christian Church . Yet this year that joy is tempered by our commemoration of the anniversary of the First World War , which stands soberly as a reminder of one of the Church 's greatest failures . <p> Some months ago , on a visit to Frankfurt , I reflected with German theologians on the letter sent on August 1 , 1914 , by the Archbishop of Canterbury to the Kaiser 's chaplain . The Archbishop wrote that : " War between two great Christian nations of kindred race and sympathies is , or ought to be , unthinkable in the 20th century of the Gospel of the Prince of Peace . " Three days later our nations were at war . <p> We can not change the past . However , we must accept responsibility for how we remember it : the future depends on how we remember the past . <p> During the visit we were taken to a small museum designed to illustrate the context in which the Bible was written . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Priene in Asia Minor , bearing an inscription from the days of the Roman Empire . It celebrates the Emperor Augustus and reads : " The birthday of the god Augustus has marked the beginning of the good news for the world . " There are other inscriptions which describe Augustus as " saviour of the whole world " . <p> St Luke , in his story of the birth of Jesus Christ , turns the imperial propaganda on its head and he has the angel of the Lord announce : " Behold I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people . For unto you is born this day in the city of David , a Saviour which is Christ the Lord . " <p> On one level , the contrast between the ruler of a large portion of the globe and a child born in a stable in an obscure province of the empire is absurd . But the Roman Empire and indeed the city of Priene is a romantic ruin , while the child continues to win new followers . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Society took me to China . Nanjing is a centre of Bible printing and the Amity Press in that city turned out 20 million copies of the scriptures last year . The Christian community in China has increased a hundred-fold since my first visit in the early Eighties . In seeking explanations for this explosive growth , there was no mention of political factors but reference to Christian charitable work . <p> Any religion , however , which has imperial rather than charitable ambitions is very dangerous . The global city of London plays host to refugee communities from parts of the world devastated by violence inflicted under the cloak of religion . All religions are exposed to the temptation denounced by the prophets as " idolatry " -- making a god in our own image . Idolatry is the process by which a bruised and humiliated ego surreptitiously reascends to worship some projection of its own rage and lust for power . <p> Nativity plays tell a different story of how God so loved the world that he was generous and gave himself to us in a vulnerable child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit which , thank God , I see all around us as the year comes to its end . <p> One of the most cheering carol services I shall remember from this year was to support the London Air Ambulance . This independent charity , which has to raise two-thirds of its funding from donations , is celebrating its 25th anniversary . Over the years the air ambulance team has brought skill and hope to 31,000 critically injured patients within the M25 . <p> Most recently , a training institute and a patient follow-up service have been developed while negotiations are under way for a second helicopter . Someone whose life was saved by the combination of generosity and high professional skill which puts the helicopter ambulance into the air commented : " It 's humbling to know that it was people 's donations that got London 's air ambulance to the scene of my car crash . I ca n't thank enough all the charity supporters for helping to save my life . " <p> Another memorable pre-Christmas gathering was in support of the Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope that blindness caused by trachoma will be eradicated from five Commonwealth countries by 2020 . We heard Dr Andrew Bastawrous , of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine , describe his work in Kenya . One of his video clips showed two elderly ladies , friends over many years , who were blind and had never seen one another . When the bandages were removed after the operation they saw one another and danced . <p> Closer to home , the Evening Standard 's Homeless Veterans Christmas appeal has shone a light on some of the delayed consequences of the dangerous work we expect our servicemen and women to do . The deployment in Afghanistan is coming to an end but the impact on the lives of those involved will last many years . <p> With the help of the Standard , awareness of the issue is rising . I joined a personal contribution to homeless veterans last Friday : two ex-servicemen , Harry Bucknall and Jock Davis , were on the road walking from Dorset to the steps of the Royal Exchange , in support of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there to welcome them , joined by so many Londoners for carols with the choir of the Military Wives and the band of the Coldstream Guards . <p> There are so many other examples of self-giving generosity that I have witnessed this year . While it sometimes seems as if the political narrative is struggling to offer plausible hope for the future , there is good news all around us if we choose to look and above all participate . <p> What we choose to remember from 2014 will shape the future . I hope you will remember with hope this Christmas that the Babe of Bethlehem outlives the Emperor of the World .
