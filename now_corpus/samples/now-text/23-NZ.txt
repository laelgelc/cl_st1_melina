Now those changes are contributing to consumer price inflation <p> Egg shortages have emerged across New Zealand in late 2022 and early 2023 as the supply of eggs has fallen . Regulation changes announced in 2012 saw battery-caged eggs banned , with this ban coming into force in 2023 . <p> Plans were also made in 2017 to ban colony-caged eggs , although this change has n't yet eventuated . <p> The change in New Zealand 's egg production methods has seen available egg numbers fall considerably in 2022 , and prices rise in response to sustained demand for eggs -- exacerbating already-high inflationary pressures on food prices . <p> This analysis provides a brief overview of total egg production trends in New Zealand , highlights regional and local egg production , and examines egg prices . <p> Egg production fell 9.1% in 2022 <p> Over the year to June 2022 , New Zealand 's egg production , measured in dozens of eggs , was just over 92 million .

All other regions have around 5% of less of total production . <p> The lower supply of eggs but no change in demand means that the chickens have come home to roost , and prices for eggs have risen in response .

They could bring red meat prices down with horse meat / dog meat / rat meat for example . Or keep sheep in a tiny cage with food pumped into them . Actually they could solve the housing crisis by keeping humans in cages . <p> Is that actually true or just a convenient excuse ? I can make a pretty nutritious family dinner for less than any premade supermarket or takeaway alternatives . Chuck some seasonal or frozen veges in a fry pan with a small amount of chicken and have a stir fry for example . But it wont taste the same as a big mac extra large combo . <p> There we go .

People can somewhat nutritionally substitute one of these 3 for another but if all 3 are unaffordable then where does this nutrition come from . <p> We are not talking about people who consume big mac for nutrition we are talking about eggs . <p> Well that nutrition certainly does n't come from junk food and takeaways . Even if a dozen eggs got to $10 a tray it 's still cheaper , not only on a per kg basis , but nutritionally than buying a round of Big Mac combos for the family . <p> Willing to bet there 's a lot of " fat " that can be trimmed from the average low income weekly food spend before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It is not so simple as the price of food . You must factor in all the ancillary stuff as well . Access to Equipment/energy/space and capability for Prep , Cooking , Cleaning , and eating . ( hard to cook a potato when you live in your car ) <p> Although overall I agree with the point , many could make better choices , and I am yet to find a takeaway that is cheaper than buying a single Apple , Banana , and carrot . <p> Pretty easy to cook a potato if you rock up to your friend/families place and help out with the meal . Your example of living in a car is extreme , and even then what you forgo in rent can easily go towards butane canisters . A basic cooker is $90 at Mitre 10 , etc . <p> Otherwise , all rentals will have a means of cooking and a sink . A single stove burner uses roughly 1.5kw of power , so that 's what 20 cents to boil the potatoes ( 20 mins ) ? I think what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than an hour in a kitchen . <p> Buy Tongan doughnuts , yum , cheap and 6 big bites . 4 doughnuts for one dollar at my local . Cant get cheaper imo . There are takeaways that sell roast potatoes , have n't bought for a long time but you could get heaps of them for one dollar back then . <p> The thing you(/we) think people should do is more expensive , this is generally not a good thing . <p> Again , what is coherent about the argument : I think some people are buying too much junk food so it 's OK eggs are more expensive ? Are you assuming its common knowledge that everyone who buys eggs has discretionary income they are spending on takeaways ? <p> Well , the thread kinda evolved into " think about diabetes etc because healthy food is more expensive than junk food " . It 's a common misconception . The numbers do n't lie as I have demonstrated , people would rather forgo actual quantities of good food if it means they do n't have to cook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out how many families are at your local fast food stores at around midday on a Tuesday ( dole day ) . And for the eggs ? They 've gone from $0.42 to $0.50 per egg . <p> One or two eggs per person for a family of 5 still adds up . It 's a 20% cost increase . There 's still no coherent link between the in-consequence of price of eggs and people choosing to use discretionary income on unhealthy food . <p> Off topic by now but a cheap stir-fry is not the best food for preventing diabetes ( a lot of sugar , carbs and processed stuff ) . That 's probably the point I would like to add : Societies common knowledge about good diets from commonly available food is horrible . Chances are beneficiaries also do n't know how bad what they are doing is . <p> I mean , there are other ways to cook the vegetables that typically go into a stir fry . My wife has a microwave steamer , you put water in the bottom , the vegies sit on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Yes , a 20% cost increase on a small food expense which yields a good protein . But you 're right , there 's no coherent link however willing to bet a good number of these people " hurting " from a couple of extra dollars on a tray of eggs buy takeaways once a week and pay no mind to the cost of that expense , while claiming " healthy food is so expensive " . <p> It 's not the veggies or small amount of meat that 's unhealthy , it 's that there wont be enough of them to satiate anyone when you have a very sweet source on-top ( steamed or frozen veggies are bland ) and only rice to fill you up . It 's better than cheaper takeaways but I ca n't see how it could be a staple healthy meal . Sorry to everyone who thinks this off topic . <p> If you know what your doing and have trained kids you can make a reasonably cheap source without too much sugar and stay away from much cheap cooking oil but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree with my nutritional assessment but the point is the whole of society is bad at nutrition , a third of us are obese and we do n't know how to fix it without treating the poor as a lower class . Those with disposable income should probably make themselves healthy before before they go mandating nutrition . Processed food has confused us on this topic . <p> When your also trying to make dairy and meat more expensive with policy as well yes 20% on eggs does matter . <p> As long as you can get a dozen 2-minute noodles for $5 you will struggle to win the price argument . 4-person family fed for 3 nights at a cost of about 40c per serve . 45c if you include the cost to boil the jug . <p> Yes for a bit more you can add veges , but meat is now out of the reach for many . <p> If you actually look around we are very much back in medieval times . Meat and veges for the rich . Bread/Flour based products for the rest . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baps and bagged lettuce is going to run you north of $25 now . That used to be an easy go-to $15 dinner for four if you were seriously time-poor . It 's more expensive than a New World pizza - figure that out ! Although you can stretch that spare roast chicken if you 've already got tomato sauce with some wraps , tinned spaghetti and some pineapple to make a few Social Investment Scheme Pizzas ! Just do n't take it out of the oven before it really starts cooking . We 've made that mistake before . <p> The huge hikes in meat prices have n't affected me much as we only really eat chicken but the increases in fish and salmon prices have virtually pushed them out of reach for now . And that 's a seriously good food for brain power and you can make some bloody delicious stuff with a decent bit of salmon - soba noodle salad with low-salt sauces is a gift from the gods . Likewise I 've enjoyed some of the paneer and tofu stuff we 've had recently . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploding food prices . If you 're so time poor or hard up against it that even things like bagged roast and baps are slipping out of reach , then you never get to try food that makes you think " shit , maybe it is worth all the effort of cooking " every once in a while . It 's just one less part of life people actually get to enjoy - which is how you should be feeling when you think about food , and not how you 're going to afford it . <p> PDK is on holiday . I 'll have a go at filling in : basically the world is going to run out of resources in the next 5 min , and anything and everything you might suggest to help will be useless , unless we cull the population by about 80% . Then repeat ad nauseum . <p> The " let them eat cake " response . Eggs are ( sorry , perhaps it is now were ) a staple and affordable source of protein for poor people . This is a classic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the consequences for everyone else . <p> A ) I do n't think chickens are moral agents . Frankly I do n't care if some chickens are suffering . Sorry if that offends your sensibilities . I do personally buy free range eggs ( to supplement the eggs from my own backyard chickens ) , but I also do n't think that I have the right to push my animal welfare morality onto a family who are only just getting by and want or need to eat cheap eggs . <p> B ) Whataboutism and a poor argument . Rent going up makes it even more important that we do n't see price pressures on food . <p> This is a portent of a wider problem . If business stops being profitable then eventually you stop doing business . <p> We 've had a global decline in interest rates for 40 years . All assets follow the same trend , business has been getting less and less profitable as part of this trend . A bit of legislation pushed this one along a bit faster , but without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the horizon , then most businesses are headed this way . <p> I read a good article 2016 that PDK posted . It was primarily about oil , and predicted that somewhere from 2020-2022 we 'd hit a crisis in the industry due to supply . It still appears very much that peak oil was 2018 , so the analysis seemed to be pretty good . It was also outlined that all the western economies , at least , are an extension of the petro chemical industry . We do n't have to run out of oil for refined products to reach a crisis of supply , the companies involved in the supply system simply have to stop making money , and stop doing business . <p> Lack of profitability does n't have to be from lack of sales , it can be that costs are simply too high . Seems a particular problem with the New Zealand economy . What does the egg producer make from the retail sale of an egg ? <p> .. bankers need to stop cackling about their super profits , and have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in cereal prices , egg producers profits are paltry ... <p> But is there central planning ? The government and public sector have no plans even on matters of national security . <p> Owners of the Marsden point refinery mulled closing down the operations for years before actually voting to do so in 2021 . Yet MBIE sat around all those years without putting a proper thought towards NZ 's fuel security . The vote prompted bureaucrats into a lengthy " engagement process " with consultants , while concrete was being poured down the refinery 's pipes . <p> the processed gas from Kapuni is used by domestic , commercial and industrial appliances , on sites ranging from food and beverage factories to hospitals and water treatment plants . Gas New Zealand chief executive Janet Carson said the product was " absolutely vital for industry and New Zealanders " . <p> I am saying do no privatise affairs of national interest in the first place . Even the Yanks are smart enough to keep fuel security in federal government hands . <p> Besides , economies more successful than ours have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market economies , including Australia and much of North and West Europe . Even Singapore describes itself as a free market economy with " dirigiste characteristics " . <p> oh doh ! confusing graph in ' chart 3 ' the battery hen eggs show the price for a dozen , but the freerange line is the price for half a dozen . Why on earth compare a half dozen with a full dozen ? Buying a dozen is way cheaper per egg than by the half . <p> This does n't mention that what seems to have caused the shortage is the supermarkets deciding to ban colony caged eggs much later than the government introduced the law which banned only battery cages . You can understand the growers being pissed off after investing in colony cages and then being told they have to go full free-range by the supermarkets . If not for that , 10 years would seem plenty of time to prepare . Other parts of the world banned battery cages decades ago <p> ... caused the shortage is the supermarkets deciding to ban colony caged eggs much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battery cages . <p> Egg producers were given two choices and decided on colony caged production . Investment to change over was mega millions . This investment is now worthless thanks to the Countdown decision to only stock from free range farms . <p> Result being some egg farms are not able to make another investment and also the resource consent issues to change over farming practices - circa 3 years . <p> We got a couple of chickens mid last year after not having any for a year or two . Cost $25 each , and feed costs about $15 a month , we get a dozen fresh eggs each week , they also eat our bread and vege scraps . They are completely free range and live a damn good life cruising around our property , and occasionally the neighbors . Pretty cheap eggs ( admittedly we already had the hen house and other stuff you need ) . <p> We 're looking into getting a few ourselves . We 're rural and have land to spare , I sense a ( very ) small business **27;1173;TOOLONG . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hook into things it 'd have to be gate sales only , but every bit helps . <p> Fails to mention that egg prices were up 22% year-on-year in October ( when they peaked ) , 15% in November 2021 , 18% in June 2019 ( and I could go on ) . <p> More seriously , this is a good warm up for when our agri-businesses have to change practices to comply with stricter domestic and international rules and standards . Food will get more expensive because producing it will require more land , materials , labour etc . When higher food prices increase the CPI , hopefully RBNZ wo n't get all excited and try and make more people unemployed to ' fight inflation ' . <p> $8.50 a dozen when you can find them and fully expecting $10 a dozen before the shortage ends . To be honest I 'm happy paying that for the only brand that I will buy and strangely it was all that Countdown had left on the shelf at one point . I guess most people can not taste the difference but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eggs . <p> It seems to me that when given the ultimatum " change or perish " many producers decided the latter option was actually preferable . If given a choice between investing millions of dollars into a new chicken farm or simply winding up the current one while extracting as much profit as possible before your 10 years is up , then selling the land off to a residential developer , I would think that retiring on a nice pile of money in the bank at 5% is a pretty darn good option . <p> Did the Govt provide any financial assistance to the chicken farmers to buy new farms for the chickens to run around on ? If not , why not ? Surely farmers exiting the industry should have been foreseen and efforts made to prevent it ? <p> Egg price indicate more extremely aggressive OCR rate hike . At 2% increase for each review time , it must be increased to at least10% in end of 2023 . NZRB must make economy into total collapse situation to fix this inflation problem . Once unemployment reach 80% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is time to go wild and aggressive ! <p> We run about 100 chooks free range . Price of chook food has doubled over the 10 years we have had them . We used to pay around $170pm a few years back . Last months bill was over $400 . Lady at the factory told me that our 25kg bag of maise , currently $23 will soon be going up to $40 . We are going to downsize . Chooks do n't lay an egg a day . They moult and do n't lay for months on end . Some lay eggs in the bushes and then come out with a tribe in a few weeks time . Half are roosters . Egg sales have never covered the food bill . We do n't kill off our old girls but do eat the roosters . <p> " Plans were also made in 2017 to ban colony-caged eggs , although this change has n't yet eventuated " Wrong . <p> This may have been in a Bill but was certainly not in the final legislation . <p> There is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eggs or battery eggs . It defines an area per hen , cage height and other welfare requirements but no such thing as battery , free range , barns etc . Of course the colony caging must comply with the legislation but the supermarkets would not know that . The old fashioned battery cages as known before 2012 would not comply with the current legislation . <p> For those interested , including the writer of this article download the Act and search layer hen . <p> The Super market saying the consumer does not want colony eggs is also claptrap until I see the survey questions and the sample size and even better the age and income groups as well . The banning of colony eggs is a supermarket requirement and not a legislative one . I suspect a higher profit margin will be made . <p> And often retailers and corporates try and get in front of legislation rather than running things to the wire . Give yourself some space , remove chances for ambiguity , or multiple changes where you can just make one change . <p> Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sell eggs deemed less socially acceptable . <p> In another eggciting sign of the inlationary times my local chippy is charging $2.20 for that alternative source of protein , the single deep fried mussel .

@@96177233 <p> Here 's our summary of key economic events over the weekend that affect New Zealand , with news all eyes this week will be on Chinese and American December inflation levels . <p> Although most of the data has been coming from the world 's largest economy , the most interesting tends are coming from the second largest , China . There are risks aplenty , giant weaknesses , and giant opportunities . It is just we ca n't get a great picture because its economic data is so opaque . There are some sources other than official sources , but not to the extent we expect in an open economy . <p> We should note first than an importer has placed an order for Australian coal , providing clear evidence of the lifting of an unofficial ban imposed more than two years ago on that trade with Australia . <p> And the sheer amount of money Chinese banks have been ' lending ' to their property developers to keep them afloat is astounding . <p> Meanwhile , China 's foreign exchange reserves rose marginally in December , mainly on reduced import demand , but they did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US$3.13 tln . <p> Chinese authorities said Chinese New Year travel will nearly double to 2.1 billion trips this season , after the country all but abolished pandemic border restrictions recently . Most travel will be internal . But there will also be a surge in international travel . Chinese booking site Trip.com said the most popular destination is Australia , followed by Thailand and Japan . We will probably see some spillover from the travel to Australia , maybe even more so given Australia decided to place pandemic testing restrictions on Chinese travelers . <p> Taiwanese exports fell a sharp -12.1% in December from the same month a year ago . Although this was less than anticipated , it is still a notable fall , mostly resulting from the trade squeeze neighbouring China is put on their country . <p> In Japan , the world 's third largest economy , the yield on 10-year Japanese government bonds rose to a seven-year high of 0.5% on Friday , hitting the Bank of Japan 's new upper limit in just weeks as other buyers shy away from the asset . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ target band for 10-year yields to 0.5% . Investors lose on rising yields and are no longer buying . <p> In the US , there were no surprises in the American non-farm payrolls data for December . Those payrolls grew +233,000 in December to 153.7 mln in the headline series . Markets had expected a +200,000 gain . But as regular readers know , there are two related surveys , the widely-reported Establishment ( employer ) survey , and the parallel Household survey . This second survey shows there is a 159.2 mln employed workforce , more than +15 mln higher than the employer survey . It has recorded that larger level before the pandemic , the difference fell away during the pandemic , and in 2022 is back to the same +15 mln additional . That extra is almost certainly the unincorporated self employed . <p> Average hourly earnings rose +0.3% from the prior month , to US$32.82 in December ( NZ$51.80/hr or NZ$108,000 pa ) following a downwardly revised +0.4% gain in the prior month and below market forecasts . This was the smallest growth in average hourly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the momentum in the American labour market is slowing , and the Fed will take heart from that . Financial markets did too . They expect that and other more recent data will continue to temper credit conditions . There is something of a new and recent rush on by corporate treasurers to tap bond markets again . <p> Employment data tends to lag economic activity however , and this may be a high-water mark to start 2023 . A leading indicator was n't so positive , factory orders . In November they dipped -1.8% from October to take them back to just +6.8% higher than year-ago levels and struggling to account for inflation . A -0.8% fall was anticipated , so this is a worse result . And that was largely due to low orders in the month for civilian aircraft . <p> Also falling away much sharper than expected is the widely-watched ISM services PMI . It was expected to come in slightly less positive ( 55 index level from the November 56.5 level ) , but in fact it dived into a minor contraction in December @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> At the same time , American inflation is biting households . Even though petrol prices are no longer adding to inflation , rents are . In a December survey , more than half the respondents said their rents rose by +$US100/month . Four percent said their increase was more than +US$500/month . The US will release its December inflation data on Friday ( NZT ) . <p> The same survey showed more than 35% of households used credit cards or loans in December to cover spending needs in the prior week . That 's up from around 32% in November and just 21% in April 2021 , when they first started collecting this data . <p> In Canada , they also reported labour force data for December . Their employed labour force grew +104,000 in the month and far more than the +8,000 expected . Most of it ( +84,500 ) was for full-time jobs . It is also a good result for them , and like the Americans , both their participation rate rose and their jobless rate fell . It probably means that more big rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspective , their employed labour force is 19.8 mln , so only 12% as large as their giant southern neighbour . <p> The EU released its December inflation report , and for the Euro area it came in at +9.2% . This was far less than the expected 9.7% and much lower than the November 10.1% . From the prior month , inflation is slowing fast , running at an annualised -4.2% deflation rate now . Much of this can be attributed to the success of their efforts to insulate themselves from the Russian energy stand-over tactics . <p> EU retail sales however showed some surprise strength , rising at a +10% annualised rate in November from October . <p> Germany reported its December retail sales data and said it will have grown +8.2% in 2022 , but that will be less than inflation . They also reported some rather grim November factory order data . <p> The UST 10yr yield starts today at 3.56% , and down -1 bps from Saturday . The UST 2-10 rate curve is still inverted at -70 bps . But their 1-5 curve is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curve is also more inverted , now at -64 bps . The Australian ten year bond is little-changed at 3.70% . The China Govt ten year bond is still at 2.90% . And the New Zealand Govt ten year is starting at 4.38% and down -2 bps . <p> And oil prices start today a bit softer from yesterday 's levels at just under US$74/bbl in the US while the international Brent price is just under US$78.50/bbl and easing back to its 12-month lows . <p> The Kiwi dollar has stayed up at 63.5 USc . Basically , we are back to week-ago levels . Against the Australian dollar however we are recovering at 92.4 AUc but still about -1c below week-ago levels . Against the euro we are firmish at 59.7 euro cents with another + ? c rise . That all means our TWI-5 starts today at 71.3 , up a net +20 bps from Saturday . <p> The bitcoin price is now at US$16,944 and up +0.6% from this time Saturday .

Some tech goods , in particular , seem to have reached a new level insofar as the RRP is concerned in the last week or so .

That meant they believed in God but did n't go to church . Somewhat opposite to their counterparts today . <p> Yes that was my impression of America . I went there in the late 80 's on an Airforce exchange . It seemed to me that they believed you could do any damned thing you pleased Monday to Saturday so long as you went to church on Sunday and confessed your sins . Start with a clean slate on Monday . the rank hypocrisy amongst the leadership was rife . Grass roots though was virtually the polar opposite ; genuine , very nice , hospitable and very welcoming and tolerant people . <p> Tourism New Zealand : International tourism bounces back quicker than expected <p> Hard to know if this is real , hopium , or deception . The article gives no actual quantitative evidence . <p> At least the visitors know that Cindy does n't care if they have Covid or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry some risk that you 'll be locked away in quarantine during the new Year holiday . <p> I was in Singapore a few weeks back , taxi driver there saying it was still slow , 40% of their tourism is Chinese . West coast South Island , quite a few motels were 100% reliant on Chinese tourism , I would say they are hoping for a massive upswing to have any chance of survival ... <p> Average hourly earnings rose +0.3% from the prior month , to US$32.82 in December ( NZ$51.80/hr or NZ$108,000 pa ) following a downwardly revised +0.4% gain in the prior month and below market forecasts . This was the smallest growth in average hourly earnings in four months . <p> Correct . There is empirical evidence backing the claim that better distributed economic gains lower Gini coefficient result in improved GDP per capita in the long run . <p> A 1 percentage point increase in the Gini coefficient reduces GDP per capita by around 1.1% over a five-year period ; the long-run ( cumulative ) effect is larger and amounts to about -4.5% . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has led to lower transitional GDP per capita growth . <p> For example , neither Stats NZ nor our MSM mention per capita performance in their quarterly GDP news ; this info usually appears within 2 lines of an otherwise long information release from Stats NZ . <p> I do n't really understand the Governmental mindset in NZ that fixates on low wages being a necessity . I would suggest that these low/minimal wages are a significant driver of most of our societal problems . I used to think it was a legacy of old socialist attitudes , but I now suspect it is a symptom of a bigger problem , that of elitism and the wealthy classes trying to preserve and protect their power and privilege . <p> In fact , we have the highest minimum wage as a % of median wage in the OECD . Businesses are forced to fork out more for labour due to high cost of necessities , not skill premium . <p> This metric also highlights the problem that by international standards , we do not compensate genuinely skilled workers well enough despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and social infrastructure in NZ and you will wonder why skilled workers would want to stick around or move here . <p> Does Iraq have an extradition treaty with the US ?

I 'm back at the moment in Asia . Where I got covid . Most people I know have had it . They were sick but thankfully they recovered after a week , including me . Maybe we can give the people who want lock downs hazard suits to wear out about and the rest of us can live with it the virus ? Iock downs are not the answer ... <p> The timing of the Chinese covid ' ' release ' ' could n't be worse .

The article suggested it was very easily spread , and also potent . We do n't want it here <p> Sounds even more relevant now that the response is dictated by the optics of a failing government , and not about the risk a variant might pose or the pressure it might put on a collapsing health system . We ca n't trust those in power to look after our interests , so we have to hope we get lucky . What a shame we already bet the farm to get to this point . <p> Too late bud , Labour are going to stuff it up again by not closing the border to them 2 weeks earlier which resulted in the first lockdown the first time around . Sensible countries have stopped their flights coming in until they know exactly what it is they are dealing with . <p> The only increase in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 2019 is in financial services . <p> Dig deeper and you will find that the methodology to calculate FDI stock considers retained earnings of FDI enterprises ( 10% or more of equity in an NZ business ) as being remitted to the direct investors and reinvested by them . <p> So , our " success " story in FDI can be better written as large NZ banks repatriating bumper profits to their Aussie parents and leaving some loose change behind each year . <p> We run a horse race between various potential explanatory variables , including the neglected role of bank credit for the real economy . The results are robust and clear : The favorable Spanish circumstances yield no evidence for FDI to stimulate economic growth . The Spanish EU and euro entry are also found to have had no positive effect on growth . The findings call for a fundamental rethinking of methodology in economics . <p> The matter is subjective . It is important to separate greenfield FDI from its brownfield counterpart ; the former kind often brings economic opportunities to a country that it otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bend or break NZ 's supermarket duopoly can have far-reaching benefits for our economy . <p> Conversely , Fonterra selling its profitable ice cream business TipTop to an English company has brought virtually no economic benefit to NZ , probably some job losses from corporate consolidation . <p> Warning : its possible these figures will have a triggering effect , look away now if you 're of a biased disposition . 115,000 new arrivals in last 3 months . That is more than the famous pre-covid rush and we know well what came next . <p> My opinion .. that amount of immigrants will be inflationary . Cars , appliances , rents .

@@96177234 <p> Here 's our summary of key economic events over the holiday that affect New Zealand , with news the expected global recession in 2023 seems a way off yet <p> Although the headlines in the US are all about how many job cuts are coming , especially from Big Tech , in fact the December data did not show that as significant . First , the December layoff report said there were -43,600 cuts in December , -43% less than the 76,835 announced in November . But that is up sharply from the 19,000 cuts announced in the same month in 2021 . <p> Second , the precursor ADP Employment Report ahead of tomorrow 's official non-farm payrolls report said private payrolls expanded +235,000 in December and well above the +150,000 expected . Large companies in the West did reduce payrolls , but that was more than made up by a hiring surge in the South . Forecasts for the December non-farm payrolls gain are currently +200,000 . <p> Initial jobless claims were surprisingly low last week as well . They rose for seasonal reasons , but by far less than expected . There are now 1.7 mln @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicators are driving equity markets lower as investors realise the Fed will be emboldened to stay fully engaged in the inflation fight . High and rising payrolls are not a sign the Fed has done enough yet to cool the American economy to get on top of inflation . And the IMF thinks the Fed still has a long way to go before they succeed . <p> In more American labour market news , their Federal Trade Commission is proposing to outlaw non-compete clauses in employment contracts . Calling the practice " exploitative " , the agency is moving to ban the clauses , which would allow workers to take jobs with rival companies or start competing businesses without the threat of being sued . They say it could increase workers earnings by +US$300 bln per year . This proposal will generate an almighty fight with business . <p> Meanwhile , the US trade deficit narrowed to -$62 bln in November , the lowest since September 2020 , and below forecasts of a -$73 bln deficit for the month . It reflects a sharp decrease in the goods deficit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down -2% while total imports fell more than -6% . Their trade deficits with both China and the EU both shrank . For the year to November , the American trade deficit ran at -US$965 bln or -3.8% of GDP . New Zealand 's equivalent deficit is -4.8% of GDP . <p> In housing markets , Auckland is n't the only big city turning in weak December real estate results . Things are just as tough , even tougher , in Toronto . <p> And the top end of the Chinese market also experienced a sharp downturn last year . <p> In Japan , consumer sentiment remained low in December but it did rise off its recent lows . The same survey revealed that almost everyone still thinks prices will rise , a view that has been almost universal in 2022 . <p> In Australia , universities there have reported huge demand from foreign students , with visa applications +40% above pre-COVID levels , driven by demand from India . A survey of prospective Indian international students found that 29% listed Canada as their preferred destination followed by Australia ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US ( 17% ) . <p> Container freight rates were little-changed again last week , with the main weakness being in the outbound China trade . Bulk cargo rates fell sharply , and heading back down to pre-pandemic levels again . One shipping boss said ocean shipping is heading for a ' great recession ' . <p> The UST 10yr yield started today at 3.72% , and little-changed from yesterday . The UST 2-10 rate curve is more inverted at -73 bps . And their 1-5 curve is also a little more inverted at -86 bps . Their 30 day-10yr curve is also well inverted , now at -40 bps . The Australian ten year bond is unchanged at 3.83% . The China Govt ten year bond is little-changed at 2.88% . And the New Zealand Govt ten year is starting at 4.37% and down another -5 bps . <p> On Wall Street , the S&amp;P500 is down -0.9% so far in its Thursday trade . In contrast , London closed up +0.6% overnight , but their European peers all slipped about -0.3% . Yesterday , Tokyo recovered +0.4% . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ +1.0% . The ASX ended little-changed . The NZX50 added more to its first-day gains , up another +0.6% . <p> And oil prices start today unchanged from yesterday 's levels at just under US$74/bbl in the US while the international Brent price is just over US$78.50/bbl and still near its yearly lows . <p> The Kiwi dollar has fallen back almost a full -1c to 62.2 USc on a surging greenback . Against the Australian dollar however we are firmish at 92.3 AUc . Against the euro we are softish at 59.1 euro cents with a - ? c dip . That all means our TWI-5 starts today at 70.6 , down a net -40 bps from yesterday . <p> The bitcoin price is now at US$16,824 and a mere -0.4% lower than this time yesterday . Volatility over the past 24 hours has remained very low at just +/- 0.4% . <p> Remember we welcome robust , respectful and insightful debate . We do n't welcome abusive or defamatory comments and will de-register those repeatedly making such comments . Our current comment policy is here . <h> 92 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be appropriate to begin reducing the federal funds rate target in 2023 . " Yes , but in 2021 you guys also told us no rate hikes for years to come . And you ended up hiking 400+ bps in 2022 . Link <p> The Federal Reserve continues to its hawkish display - just like it had in 2018 . And just like back then , all the evidence keeps piling up that they 're completely wrong . Another big one today to go with several crucial pieces over the last several days show why markets are n't even paying attention to these dead-hawks-flying . <p> Rising interest rates has an opposite , that being a shortage of credit . Anything related to credit , such as a credit fueled assett bubble ( housing ) needs a constant flow of cheap credit to keep it inflating . <p> This is what Milton Friedman called the interest rate fallacy , and it indeed refuses to die . We can tell what monetary conditions are in the real economy , as opposed to financial liquidity , though the two can be linked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money is plentiful , interest rates will be high not low ; and when money is restricted , interest rates will be low not high . The reason is as Wicksell described more than a century ago : <p> The natural rate is never high or low in itself , but only in relation to the profit which people can make with the money in their hands , and this , of course , varies . In good times , when trade is brisk , the rate of profit is high , and , what is of great consequence , is generally expected to remain high ; in periods of depression it is low , and expected to remain low . <p> When nominal profits are expected to be robust , holders of money must be compensated for lending it out by higher interest rates . Thus , the same holds for inflationary circumstances , where nominal profits follow the rate of consumer prices . During the Great Inflation , interest rates were n't low at all , they were through the roof well into double digits and higher by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , interest rates were low and stayed there because , as Wicksell wrote , the rate of profit was low and was expected to be low well into the future . High quality borrowers were given as much money as they could want while the rest of the economy was deprived of funds ; liquidity and safety being the only preferences in what sounds entirely familiar . Link <p> In housing markets , Auckland is n't the only big city turning in weak December real estate results . Things are just as tough , even tougher , in Toronto . <p> Good Morning from #Germany where housing market has come to standstill . Monthly mortgage lending has collapsed by 40% in Nov YoY , representing 3rd neg record in a row since start of statistics in 2003 . Mortgage volume dropped to ? 1.4Bn , lowest since 2011. ( via @BarkowConsult ) Link <p> Hmm , ... even the peak in mortgage lending in Germany is well below the peak in New Zealand . Germans like to invest more in enterprises who make and export stuff in stead of bricks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason why their GDP per Capita and their average wage is well ahead of New Zealand 's . It also shows with 80 million residents their housing market is not important . <p> " Late Lord Alexander of Weedon who , as chairman of the British bank NatWest , visited the German Bundesbank many years ago . <p> Lord Alexander was carrying a copy of an English newspaper that displayed a headline to the effect : " Good news -- another rise in house prices " , on which the legendary Bundesbank president Karl-Otto P ? hl commented : " Over here , that would be bad news . " " <p> That 's funny Foxglove , I 've always thought Audaxsses was anti western ideology . Even though it appears from his previous posts he ( or is it she ? ) has been employed in western countries and hopefully done well . <p> Meanwhile , the US trade deficit narrowed to -$62 bln in November , the lowest since September 2020 , and below forecasts of a -$73 deficit for the month . <p> Whether the plunge in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or general economic malaise is unclear ; adding to the confusion , the slowdown in US consumer demand for foreign goods and services will serve to boost GDP due to the way net trade is imputed for GDP purposes . In other words , expect a jump in Q4 GDP estimates due to a plunge in US imports . Link <p> It is showing in the US a reducing of inventories as they had a massive build up . I believe in the US what we are seeing as the bonds invert it is being a useful signal for the corporates to adjust , so we are seeing some adjustments occurring . Biden 's announcement of allowing 30,000 migrants fast track through the borders may alleviate the job demand . so far the average 10% layoffs in the tech industry may well be visa holders which wo n't impact th numbers . Even though US car sales are back to the 2011 numbers , GM still outperformed Toyota ! The Administration passing of several bills are prepping the US to be leaders in tackling climate Change . Some achievement but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . Wish we in New Zealand were in the same forward looking sweet spot . <p> New Zealand 's key structural problem is not just the trade deficit at 4.8% but the external current account deficit ( which takes into account all of the invisibles and interest transfers as well as the trade deficit ) which is 7.9% of GDP . In the developed world , that appears to be a unique NZ problem . At some time the hens will come home to roost . KeithW <p> Aha ! There is good reason to criticise the dominant role of big four aussie banks in the NZ economy . But I do n't think we can blame these banks as being the dominant cause of the the structural problems that determine the external current account deficit . We have to inspect our own navels to find those answers . And it is not a pretty sight . KeithW <p> Have n't we been doing the negative current account deficit since the 70 's Keith ? If it worked for 40+ years then it can work for another 40 surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to infinity , everyone knows that . <p> If you look at the data from stats NZ the account deficit has allways been around 1-3% of GDP in the past . The current magnitude of 7.9% is worrying and increases the dependency on the willingness of overseas investors to fund this deficit . It could mean our interest swap rates could stay higher for longer than we would wish even with the OCR going down again . With the milk collection down by about 4% and the impact of tourism being limited because we have to import all the diesel they use , the future looks not very sunny . <p> NZ 's current account deficit was similar in the GFC . By the end of 2009 it was back to more " normal " levels . Nothing really bad happened to the NZ economy then , so it does n't necessarily mean that we have something awful awaiting us . <p> The GFC was not pleasant , but at that time there were other factors operating that allowed us to skate our way out of the external account deficit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next few years are going to be more than a little challenging . KeithW <p> From the B&amp;L figures I have seen , the average is around 370ha . Does that seem about right to you ? Another figure puts it at 200ha . From what you say , the smaller figure would include all the farms with just a few sheep . <p> linklater01 , I do n't spend much time looking at averages for sheep+beef , because so few farms resemble the average . But any sheep+ beef farm that is less than about 400 ha will struggle to support a family without other income sources . KeithW <p> Family members currently work a 450ha sheep and beef . I doubt it makes enough to pay their wages , I once did some figures on the winter dairy grazers they have . I thought they were better of just selling the silage bale 's they had saved for them but grazing the beefes and sheep on the area was even less worth while . Does n't matter now , by end of July it 'll all be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be that high or low interest rates - will not solve the current account deficit . <p> The situation will self correct when capital markets decide they do n't wish to continue pumping capital into NZ . At that time the exchange rate will decline and imports will become a lot more expensive in $NZ . The issue is not so much whether that will happen but rather , when it will happen . <p> The timing of the specific event that causes the financial reef fish to move as a tide rather than just darting hither and thither is impossible to predict with any confidence but eventually ( or sooner ) it will happen . KeithW <p> I 've always wondered how enforceable post employment clauses are , particularly in NZ . Surely the company should only have a say over your life if you are still employed by them , and if you are employed by them then they would have to pay you . Obviously they should be allowed to protect their IP , but they should n't be allowed to tell you who you can work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past , and always just ignored them and never had any issues - but then again I 've never worked for a company with any crazy top-secret tech or anything like that . <p> When they 've been in contracts in the past they 've always seemed unenforceable and poorly written ( e.g. one - for a particularly tin-pot outfit - was basically ' for 12 months you can not work for any company we deem to be in any way remotely in competition , even if we fire you or make you redundant ' ) . <p> Personally , I do n't think they should be allowed - perhaps unless the employer is willing to pay for garden leave . The second you stop paying an employee , they should be considered a free agent and within their rights to act in their own best interest . <p> True , although that falls more under non-solicitation , right ? ( which I feel is more acceptable/reasonable ) . <p> Once again it 's probably because I 've never worked a role where this would be a big issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salespeople/business development and a highly competitive marketplace , it 's a bigger problem . <p> Not taking clients may sound like a reasonable clause , but if you are in sales it would be hard to do your job without taking clients . Personally I think any post employment conditions should only be allowed if they are prepared to pay you your full wage to not work , and even then you should still be allowed to quit that gardening leave and do what you want ( but why would you ! ) . <p> Yeah it 's the not being able to work for a competitor clause that is crazy . If you are specialised in that vertical you do n't really have many other options . If it were enforceable then the company could treat you poorly with no pay reviews etc as you basically have to change career to leave . Even with gardening leave ( which I was never offered ) it still makes it hard to change company . It should n't be legal to put it in an employment contract . <p> Prices , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drop as the self-reinforcing dynamic of liquidation and repricing of risk feeds on itself . As painful as this liquidation and repricing of risk is for borrowers and lenders , those without debt , those with cash and those with essential skills that are in demand regardless of boom or bust will all benefit . Those burdened with high costs and promises that can not be kept will be liquidated . Those with low costs and few promises have the means to adapt to changing conditions . ( CH Smith ) <p> We have in the Western world a demographic issue . We boomers are retiring . We have n't had a birth rate to replace those workers . We all had covid and generally a stalling of immigration . We have had unwelcoming policy geeks preventing qualified people being able to work here from Doctors Nurses , tech coders .. oh we could go on . we have seen the panic of not being able to have tourist and Pacificia not able to come to work here and a rapid response but no changes to our tax system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not taxed by doing that work . <p> And do n't tell me that the same geeks exist in the US the UK and more . The UK voted Brexit and no longer have the EU as its work pool . <p> As a bunch we just are not pragmatic . let 's call it what it is . We have a pack of wallies in Wellington . <p> My experience with most firms is that they tended to keep pro-forma contracts and gave them out to everyone they onboarded for years at a time , regardless of how enforceable or relevant the contracts are to the role being performed . <p> Case in point , a car dealership with a House Rules section that forbid staff to drive turbocharged or V8 company cars without express written authority - might have been useful at one point , but given the proliferation of turbos and small engines these days , entirely nonsensical . Likewise , no provision whatsoever about restricting electric vehicle use despite some of the affordable SUVs verging on 90s super-hatch/boy-racer performance numbers . Relics from a by-gone era @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which used to be extending non-pro-rata 'd annual leave to part-time staff , or giving casuals contracts that were literally the same with the word ' permanent full-time ' swapped for ' casual ' . That ai n't gon na do it . <p> Our government 's of both persuasions are way too hands off with employment law . I do n't want to live in a socialist country where companies are completely screwed over , but we are a long way from that . Our employment competitors over the ditch have to pay long service leave , redundancy leave , lots of superannuation , etc . Are our light weight employment laws making us more attractive to companies or less attractive to employees ? Even when labour are in power they just want to empower unions rather than legislating better working conditions for everyone . <p> Do n't get me started on erosion of redundancy . With each contract I 've had , it 's notably shrunk by 50% with each full time job . Soon it will be something that the company gets to push onto workers with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example of not solving the problem , which is the lowering of the bar for everyone . <p> NZ electricity generation came in at a 4% decrease , the lowest since 2005 ( when the population was 1 million less ) a mix of increased distributed generation , new build replacements at higher efficiency levels , demand destruction from large users such as Norske Skog and Marsden point ( around 100mw ) and increased efficiency in manufacturing , and reduced irrigation due to increased rainfall . <p> I can not understand why petrol prices are so high . Oil at $78 per barrel is modest and out exchange rate is close to long term average . Adding back the 25cents per litre plus GST puts prices close to $2.70 per litre . We are being shamelessly ripped off and despite all the rhetoric , the government is sitting by inertly . <p> Fast to rise very slow to fall . They raise the price when the cheaper fuel is still in the storage tanks at the station but wait weeks till after the cheaper stuff arrives to fill the tanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't Labour say were were " Being Fleeced " about 3 years ago now and they would look into it ? Looking at it is all this government can do . They are so gone this year . <p> If people have not understood it by now , then it 's just illiteracy . The oil companies are private corporations , they need to show increase in profits every quarter to their share holders . This is the financial world build around us which we have been happily supporting . <p> Everyone wants their house prices to double in 10 years , accordingly the commodity prices also increase as clearly stated by politicians in this country that house price increases is a good problem to have . Crikey how dumb can one be . <p> We are always looking to hire good qualified people , but have held off recently due to the everything bubble fever that also fed through to employment ( ' be quick ' ) . We read all the job ads in our sector . It 's clear from that the heat is easing , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It does make me wonder what firms do when they realise they 've paid too much for alot of expensive seat warmers ; it 's not cheap or easy to let people go in NZ . I look forward to having conversations with candidates about the benefits of a new role rather than solely what we can offer them financially , the former question being something they seem to have completely lost interest in over the last year or two . Free Covid money set in people 's minds that there is an entitlement to be paid , regardless of their contribution or production . It 'll be an expensive lesson to learn , especially if they bought a house on cheap money in the same period using magic money salaries to qualify for a mortgage . <p> U.S. stocks climbed on Friday after December employment data showed wage growth decelerated last month while a closely watched manufacturing report reflected a contraction in the services industry . Investors perceived the releases as a sign Federal Reserve officials may ease their rate hiking campaign .

All three major averages were on pace to round out the first week of 2023 with losses before Friday , but the indexes will end in positive territory if momentum holds . <p> This news will please the fed reserve . It could be a good year for stocks , not that i care about that . The sharemarket is forward looking and rising stocks bode well . Even if some companies like Tesla are not , it is the general mood <p> The ten year bond is down 4 percent from 3.72 on the news . Down 35bp from recent high . Apparently the fed does not fight against market rates , so they could even drop the fed funds rate at next meeting end of January . Is it another 100bp move higher .

@@96177238 <h> No King Kong game , but Poverty Bay finish on good note <p> That 's another way of saying Thermisol Poverty Bay 's game against unbeaten Wairarapa-Bush Blue was washed out yesterday . <p> Both teams were denied their fifth and final game at the Riverbend/Hawke 's Bay Year 8 Black Grade tournament after three eventful days . <p> The Jeremy Castles-coached Gisborne crew , who as Year 7s never tasted victory last year , came back from the tourney with a nine-wicket win against Johnsonville in Game 2 . <p> Overall , they took 33 wickets and scored 430 runs , twice scoring more than 100 runs as a team . <p> On Saturday , a 50-over game -- the player highlight of the tourney -- was reduced to 40 and moved from the Frimley Park 1 turf wicket to that ground 's artificial turf . Despite that , the Bay got a lot out of a rain-affected match with Eastern Suburbs . <p> After Suburbs captain Tom Baddeley won the toss and chose to bat on a cloudy , still day , the Wellingtonians ' batting line-up made hay while the sun shone . <p> That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posted 213-9 , Baddeley in at No.5 hitting eight fours and a six in his 53 from 35 balls . He and opener Aryan Doshi ( 60 ) both retired , the latter having put on 25 with Alec Barker ( 19 ) before Barker -- the king wicket -- was caught in sensational fashion by wicketkeeper Charlie Castles off opening bowler Gayesha Mahabalage ( 2-11 ) . <p> Before yesterday , Barker had not been dismissed in three innings , having made 49 against Wairarapa-Bush , 50 against Clifton Pirates and 52 against Napier-Tech , for an average of 151 . Doshi featured in four fine partnerships and Suburbs ' Robbie Burston was busy as first-drop , with 21 off 17 balls . <p> Like his fellow Bay paceman Mahabalage , Nathan Putter ( 2-21 ) produced three probing overs as the seventh bowler against an Eastern Suburbs side whose stature has grown since their encounter with Lone Star Wairarapa-Bush Blue , the strongest team in the grade , on Thursday . <p> In that clash , the Bush made 263-1 in 40 overs , retired their opening pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and lost their first wicket at 234 after 34.5 overs in a 73-run win . <p> Poverty Bay 's Harvey Reynolds carried his bat for 42 in the nine-wicket win against Johnsonville on Friday morning and skipper Castles hit a six and five fours in his 40-ball innings of 42 from No.3 yesterday . <p> Suburbs coach David Dornan rates the **29;1343;TOOLONG highly : " We were happy to get Charlie 's wicket -- caught by Doshi at mid-on from off-spinner Baddeley ( 1-9 in 3 overs ) , because he 's a smart player ; he 's patient and he 's hard to get out . <p> " I 'd add , too , that it was n't easy to bat second , as it rained for about 40 minutes , and rained hard for 30 of those . <p> " As we did batting first , the Bay boys backed up well and ran hard between wickets . They 'd shown earlier that they 're a very good bowling and fielding side . Archer Allen ( 1-20 from four overs ) with the new cherry was absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 129 in 29.2 overs . <p> Allen made 17 from No.5 , Robbie Newlands 13 at second-drop and Alex Langford 12 batting at No.6 . The only Suburbs bowler to take two wickets was the 12th used , medium-pacer Matthew Eglinton ( 2-9 from eight balls ) . <p> That his Suburbs outfit conceded only 14 runs in sundries on Saturday was a factor not lost on Dornan ( extras cost the Bay 48 ) , and they held the odd " screamer " -- Burston 's catch at square leg to dismiss Bay opener Josh Levy for 1 off a pull-shot to the bowling of paceman Lorenzo di Maio ( 1-9 from three overs , one a maiden ) was as big a dismissal in the context of the match as Doshi hanging on to Castles . <p> Dornan added : " As good as Charlie and Archer were in the middle , the Poverty Bay boys and parents were fantastic , too . It was certainly the most enjoyable game we 've played here so far . " <p> Coach Castles ' aim of seeing every member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' play possible . <p> " The boys were competitive in every game , bowled really well and thoroughly enjoyed themselves on and off the field -- it was a success , " he said . <p> " Everyone contributed at different stages and I saw their confidence grow , with better calling as batsmen , bowling well as a unit , and -- just as an example , because all of them fielded well -- Finn Robertson held three of the best catches you 'd ever see .

A refugee from Somalia and the first African-born member of the Foreign Affairs Committee , Omar is a frequent target for members of the GOP . <p> Republicans have often claimed Omar , who has represented Minnesota 's 5th District since 2019 , is an antisemite . But Omar said she believes McCarthy wants her off committees because she 's Muslim . <p> " I do not actually think that he has a reason outside of me being Muslim and thinking I should not be , " Omar told HuffPost .

@@96395236 <h> Can Wurz Win In Invercargill ? <p> Austria 's Charlie Wurz heads into this weekend 's second round of the Castrol Toyota Formula Regional Oceania Championship as the series leader , but will be looking to take his first win at the fearsome Teretonga Raceway in Invercargill . <p> The young guns are at Teretonga this weekend . Picture Bruce Jenkins <p> The track is the most southerly circuit in the world recognised by the FIA and has a rich motorsport history . It 's long straight and fast flowing corners are well suited to the Toyota FT-60 used by all competitors in the championship and Wurz will be keen to take a win on New Zealand soil . <p> Two seconds and a fourth at Highlands Motorsport Park for the first round were a strong start but Wurz will want more , especially in a country where his father Alexander raced on his way to a career in Formula One . <p> Wurz senior famously raced with two different coloured race boots , a habit that that started during his time in New Zealand when he mislaid one of them and had to find a replacement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , it will be beating round one pacesetters David Morales and Callum Hedge , who both took wins last weekend . <p> Of the two , Hedge will probably feel he has something to prove this weekend at Teretonga . His speed at Highlands was outstanding and he looked untouchable in the first race . He did n't make the progress he would have liked in the second race but in the third needed a trip to the pits after consistent kerb hopping damaged his car 's suspension . Watch out for his prodigious qualifying speed and his Senna-like build up to a big lap which starts with him lagging at the back and slowly building up tyre temperature -- specifically to a point where he wants it -- before putting in an all-out lap that is on the limit everywhere . <p> Star of the show at Cromwell in many respects was Morales . The bubbly kid from Florida got his head down at the start of the weekend and just got better and better . Unknown to Kiwi fans and probably most of the global motorsport community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very much under the spotlight as a rising star in single seaters . <p> His win in the feature race was by winning standards an excellent one . He took off at the start , effectively raced Hedge into a mistake and then dominated . That was despite it being in his words ' the longest and hardest race " he had done . And he did it feeling far less than 100% physically too . There 's no question he 's going to get better and better with more time in the car , so it is fair to say he 'll be a threat for overall honours again this weekend . <p> James Penrose won the second race last weekend -- a reverse top eight grid which favoured those who finished lower in the top ten in the first race on Saturday -- but it gave him a little extra wind in his sails for the feature race on Sunday and the likeable Kiwi can be expected to once again be a contender this weekend at a circuit he knows well . <p> Another United States driver , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first weekend too , and he could spring a surprise . So too , could Australian Ryder Quinn , a racing rookie with just two years of motorsport behind him . He was right on the pace in testing at Highlands but did n't quite find the extra few tenths as his rivals did when it mattered in qualifying . He races hard though , and if he can improve his grid position he definitely has the speed for consistent podium finishes . <p> In his camp from this round onwards is former Indy Lights champion and Indycar driver Spencer Pigot . Pigot was a top performer in all junior categories prior to his Indycar career and will have plenty of knowledge that Jacob will benefit from . <p> Chloe Chambers knows more about the Toyota FT-60 she is racing than most of the field , having used the car in two rounds of the W Series last season . She put that knowledge to very good effect at the first round , moving steadily closer to the front running pace over the weekend . Her form in the feature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical nature of the cars and track , she worked her way through to fifth place at the end and bagged some very impressive lap times . Watch out for this promising American racer too . <p> Yet another outstanding Kiwi , Liam Sceats , is another who could shine in New Zealand 's deep south . He could be well satisfied with his first weekend in a major single seater championship as he raced to a podium finish in the feature race . Importantly he kept his nose clean and did n't make any really obvious mistakes all weekend . <p> Josh Mason got his weekend underway with a couple of big mistakes in Cromwell , damaging one car in testing and then suffering a decent off into the barriers on Friday . The youngster though , bounced back in style with a solid weekend where he demonstrated some very obvious pace as an experienced junior formulae racer in the UK and Europe . If he maintains that momentum this weekend , he 'll be near the front . <p> Breanna Morris -- the fourth Kiwi in the field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her form for the second round . Highly regarded in New Zealand and successful in Formula Ford , there 's no reason to expect she wo n't be much closer to the pace at what is a less physically demanding track on the CTFROC calendar . <p> Of the rest , Australian Tom McLennan will be looking for change in fortune and should benefit from some input from vastly experienced Toyota single seater racer and local boy Brendon Leitch . Ryan Shehan and Lucas Fecury also had strong moments in the first weekend of the championship , but like everyone else will be hunting tenths to move up the very competitive order . <p> Testing on Friday will be followed by qualifying and a race on Saturday . There will be another qualifying session for the feature race on Sunday morning , followed by a reverse grid format race and then the main event in the afternoon , the Spirit of a Nation Trophy .

But when I talk about the future -- about moving in together or how our relationship is progressing -- he pulls back . I do n't have time to waste if I want a kid by the time I 'm 40 . Is his reticence a red flag ? - Sara <p> A : I sympathise with your fear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see is that you are rushing your new boyfriend because you want a baby in short order . You 've been dating for only 10 weeks ! Your boyfriend probably is n't yet sure about your future together . Are you ? Is this man your life partner or simply the guy standing in front of you at this moment ? <p> Try to uncouple your worries about fertility from your concerns about the relationship . I will not be the jerk who mansplains the pressure on women to get pregnant . Still , I urge you to see a specialist to assess your current fertility and your options for pregnancy in the future . If it 's affordable and viable , consider freezing some eggs now to give yourself some breathing room . <p> You are wrestling with major decisions : partnership and parenthood . I would hate to see you make a mistake -- marry the wrong guy or scare off the right one -- by rushing . If your boyfriend stays reticent over the coming months , we can talk about red flags then . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family , including through adoption or by becoming a foster parent . <h> A brother sexts , a sister frets <p> Q : My brother and I went home to celebrate our mother 's birthday . While we were there , I saw by accident that my brother was sexting with a woman who is not his fianc ? e . ( She did n't make the trip . ) I am so upset . Should I warn his fianc ? e about his disgusting behaviour ? - Sister <p> A : Let 's put aside questions about the " accident " that caused you to spy on your brother 's phone and read a text chain closely enough to determine both its subject and the identity of the other party . <p> To the extent this is any of your business , which I question , why would n't you start by talking to your brother ? We do n't know the circumstances of this conversation , what came of it or whether your brother has an agreement with his fianc ? e about online flirting . Unless your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to imagine why his fianc ? e would be your first stop . <h> It 's not the flight that makes a first hello special <p> Q : My husband 's father is dying and has only a few weeks to live . We have a newborn , and my husband wants the three of us to fly from New York , where we live , to Paris , where his father lives , so his dad can meet the baby before he passes . We 're told that his father is mostly out of it now . I am terrified to fly with our newborn with the current rates of Covid infection , flu and RSV . Plus , flying for eight hours with a baby while pumping breast milk feels like too much to me ! What should I do ? - Wife <h> Advertisement <p> A : Trust your instincts . Be gentle with your husband , though , when you make your case . Both of you are probably overwhelmed with the new baby , and your husband will soon be grieving a deep loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once . <p> Your husband 's impulse to let his dying father hold his grandchild is a loving one , but it 's not practical now . Encourage him to make the trip alone . Explain -- with your doctor , if necessary -- that your newborn 's immune system is too vulnerable to illness to make long flights sensible . A video introduction to the baby will be fine , but your husband may need your help to see that . <h> Just be glad I 'm not asking for interest <p> Q : Last summer , I bought four tickets to a concert for three friends and me . They each agreed to pay $400 before I bought the tickets . We had a great time ! Two of my friends repaid me at the concert ; one did n't . I reminded her a few weeks later by text . She apologised profusely and promised to pay me right away . Well , now it 's four months later , and she still has n't paid . I want to send another reminder , but I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me back ? - Friend <p> A : Either your friend is going to pay you , or she is not . It 's true , I suppose , that delaying your ( second ) request lets you avoid the certainty of her being a deadbeat . Still , she has strung you along for months already , and here you are fretting preemptively about her next move . Not stellar friend behaviour ! <p> Ask her for the money directly . The sooner she acts , the sooner you can start processing your feelings about it . This is not a problem that improves with time .

" The year of the Rabbit stands for hope . " <p> There is little official consensus on what constitutes a mass shooting ; different organisations use different measures .

There were 690 shootings with four or more victims in 2021 , more than double the 2014 total . The number fell slightly last year , to 647 , but remained significantly higher than in previous years . <p> And the number of such shootings appears to be rising in the first few weeks of this year , as compared with similar periods in recent years .

And the type of policy interventions that are most likely to avert them are different . <p> " All gun violence and the loss of any one individual is one too many , " Schildkraut said .

But FBI data on the number of firearm background checks can serve as a measure . By that count , the totals have swelled to 40 million background checks in 2021 from 10 million in 2005 . <p> But subsequent work suggests that the governing factor may be easy access to guns , not ownership of them , said Lankford , the University of Alabama criminologist , who wrote the 2015 study . <p> Nearly 40 per cent of American men tell researchers that they own a gun , so gun ownership alone is not a useful predictor of who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Mounjaro regulates blood sugar , suppresses appetite and , if one is to believe the hushed accounts recently exchanged at an Upper East Side hair salon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everybody is either on it or asking how to get on it , " said Dr Paul Jarrod Frank , a dermatologist in New York .

In recent months , these drugs have been prescribed so frequently off-label that shortages prevented some diabetics and obese people from getting their medicine . <p> Many doctors worry that the drugs ' current popularity , fuelled in part by social media , has resulted in people taking them without sufficient medical supervision -- a risky move considering the possibility of rare but serious side effects like thyroid cancer , pancreatitis and kidney failure . And drugs like Ozempic can also cause less serious but still debilitating symptoms including nausea , vomiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attest ( see : #ozempic ) . <p> Some of the side effects are " extremely rare if the medication is being prescribed at the right dose and with careful medical supervision , " said Dr Rocio Salas-Whalen , an endocrinologist in New York , who said she has prescribed this family of medication and its predecessors to more than 8,000 patients since 2005 . <h> Advertisement <p> " Mounjaro is like the Apple 14 of these drugs , " said Salas-Whalen , who did not treat Berger . Salas-Whalen said it has the same ability to control blood sugar as Wegovy and Ozempic , but that in her practice , she had seen " almost double the weight loss and close to none of the side effects . " <p> The FDA reported that in its clinical trials , which were done on diabetics , patients taking Mounjaro lost , on average , 5kg more than those taking drugs like Ozempic .

" My body looked great , but my face looked exhausted and old . " <h> Advertisement <p> Dr Oren Tepper , a plastic surgeon in New York , said that it 's common for weight loss to deflate key areas of the face , leading to a more aged appearance .

" <p> Indeed , as Catherine Deneuve is purported to have said : " At a certain age , you have to choose between your face and your ass . " But these days , in certain moneyed circles , that adage no longer seems to apply , with the now common combination of weight-loss drugs and volume-restoring filler . <p> " I see it every day in my office , " said Frank , who said he coined the term " Ozempic face " to describe the condition . " A 50-year-old patient will come in , and suddenly , she 's super-skinny and needs filler , which she never needed before . I look at her and say , ' How long have you been on Ozempic ? ' And I 'm right 100 per cent of the time . It 's the drug of choice these days for the 1 per cent .

To bring back a youthful fullness to Berger 's face , Frank injected Radiesse and hyaluronic acid-based fillers in strategic places all over her face -- around the temples , under the eyes , in the buccal hollows and around the jawline , the mouth and lips . <p> To restore volume , Bhanusali uses Radiesse in combination with Sculptra , an injectable that stimulates collagen production and can last for up to 24 months .

@@96585231 <h> New hospital : Public deserves greater sense of clarity <p> In the first of a two-part series , Local Advisory Group chairman Pete Hodgson offers a personal view of what is and is n't happening at the new Dunedin Hospital . <p> My summer has been punctuated by people asking me what is really going on at the new Dunedin Hospital ? There has been some accurate reporting , some inaccurate information on hospital beds , some quoting from earlier documents now seriously out of date , some politicking , some genuine concern , and quite a lot of confusion . <p> This is our public hospital . I think the public are entitled to a clearer picture of what is , and is not , being built . <p> This article includes my personal opinion . So , it is important that the reader knows I have no construction experience and nor am I a clinician . That said , I have been the Minister of Health , the Chair of the Southern DHB and I have chaired or served on both the governance group for the new hospital , and the local advisory group , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay person . <p> The business case for the new hospital was passed by Cabinet in 2021 . About three years of analysis and planning had gone into the process . The business case was very detailed and the design of the hospital was well under way . Therefore the cost estimate of $1.47 billion was thought to be well informed . <p> Not so . An unusually large and sudden cost escalation of about $200 million soon arrived , courtesy of Covid , global commodity price rises , shipping delays and costs , and more recently the impact of the war in Ukraine . <p> The normal ways of meeting cost increases by reducing the specifications of the project and using contingency funding were never going to cover such a big cost escalation . So the Government acknowledged that the business case would need to be altered by reducing the specification , but also by increasing funding . <p> In December , the Government announced savings of $90 million and an increase in funding of $110 million , taking the total cost to $1.58 billion . <p> The savings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source of much public discussion . So let 's explore each of the concerns in turn . <p> There has been no reduction in bed numbers except for 12 mental health services for older people MHSOP beds . The reduction , from 24 , has been made because , locally , managers and clinicians are asking whether some patients would be better off being cared for in the community . <p> There are no straightforward answers . These patients are sometimes very unwell and need close care but equally hospital is n't a great place for someone to spend a whole lot of time . As a comparator , Southland hospital has no MHSOP beds . Probably , Dunedin does too much and Southland too little . <p> In my view , this is an entirely sensible cut . The additional 12 beds will be shelled , and will be fitted out in the future if the need arises . <p> One area of saving which has received no publicity is the reduction in single bed rooms with their own ensuite . The business case had about 75% of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 62% . <p> There is no right answer here . Single patient rooms obvious cost more and deliver more privacy , but of course some patients prefer company . The current hospital has rather few single rooms ; nearly everyone is in a four bed configuration . I suspect 75% was a tad high ; the new Whangarei hospital looks like it will have 50 % . But I do n't really know what the right figure is . <p> I am not at all troubled by the delay to the installation of a PET scan . It is a newish imaging technology available only in the private sector in New Zealand . So installing the public sector 's first ever PET scan in Dunedin , rather than Auckland , makes little sense . Demand , currently modest , will grow over time . <p> A PET scan in Dunedin would be timely say 10 or 15 years after opening when we are due to relocate the oncology services from the corner of Hanover St. <p> Mothballing the third MRI until we need it makes good sense to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last twelve months ; a third one surely wo n't be needed for a while . <p> The 28 surgical spaces have been reduced to 26 . This includes 18 general operating theatres , down from 20 . Of the 18 , 15 will be open on day one and the other three will come on line as the need grows . The current hospital has 12 . The main reason that change became possible is the growing trend towards 10-hour surgical days rather than 8-hour days . In other words the very modelling that told us to build 20 is already becoming outdated . <p> Importantly the theatres are all being built large enough to accommodate many bits of modern kit and are well supported by ample preparation , recovery and storage rooms . <p> * In his second article in Monday 's Otago Daily Times , Mr Hodgson will explore some of the things that have not been in the public purview , but should be , and some of the things he is a bit grumpy about .

Interventions like expanding physical activity and nutrition programmes in schools have not been enough to prevent weight gain and obesity in children and adolescents , scientists say . Photo / Erin Schaff , The New York Times <p> The American Academy of Pediatrics recently issued new guidelines for treating the more than 14 million children and adolescents with obesity in the United States . The recommendations came as a surprise to many parents , andto some experts , as they encourage vigorous behavioural interventions even for very young children , as well as drug treatment or surgery for adolescents . <p> The guidelines spring from a scientific understanding of obesity that has been evolving for decades . Obesity is a risk factor for a number of disorders , including Type 2 diabetes , high blood pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treating the problem as early as possible may help prevent a lot of misery . <p> Here are answers to some questions about pediatric obesity research and why experts are now advising aggressive treatment . <p> What do the new guidelines say about the causes of obesity ? <p> The American Academy of Pediatrics ' recommendations stress that obesity is not just a consequence of poor eating habits and a lack of exercise . Obesity is a chronic disease with many intertwined causes , including genetics . <p> Researchers now know that obesity is one of the most strongly inherited traits . Studies conducted decades ago showed that identical twins reared apart usually grow up to have similar body shapes and weights . Adopted children tend to have the same shapes and weights as their biological parents . <p> A genetic predisposition sets the stage for some children to gain weight in an environment in which food -- often poor-quality food -- is everywhere . And weight gain can become a vicious cycle . <p> Children and adolescents with obesity often experience teasing and bullying , which , the academy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , avoidance of health care services and decreased physical activity , further complicating the health trajectory " . <h> Advertisement <p> They are defined by body mass index , a measure of weight and height . ( It is an imperfect measure ; many muscular athletes , for example , have high BMIs but are in excellent shape . ) <p> Overweight means a BMI at or above the 85th percentile but below the 95th percentile for children and teenagers of the same age and sex . Obesity is a BMI at or above the 95th percentile for children and teenagers of the same age and sex . <p> When did pediatric obesity become such a problem ? <p> For scientists , the alarms went off in the 1980s and 1990s . Before then , experts took comfort in data from the 1960s indicating that just 5 per cent of children and adolescents had obesity . It just did not seem like a pressing issue . <p> But national data in the 1980s showed that the rate had doubled . By 2000 , it had tripled , and by 2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about why it was happening circulated widely , often citing favourite villains like Big Food , too little exercise or a lack of fresh fruits and vegetables . But rigorous evidence was scarce and solutions evasive . <p> Did n't anyone try to do intervention studies ? <p> Yes , but results were disappointing . In the 1990s , for example , the National Institutes of Health sponsored two large , rigorous studies . Researchers asked whether weight gain in children could be prevented by intervening in schools by expanding physical education , offering more nutritious cafeteria meals , teaching students about proper eating habits and the need to exercise , and involving parents . <h> Advertisement <p> One study -- an eight-year , US$20 million project sponsored by the National Heart , Lung and Blood Institute -- followed 1704 third graders ( 8-9 years old ) in 41 elementary schools in the Southwest . Students there were mostly Native Americans , a group at high risk for obesity . <p> The schools were divided into two groups . Some schools got intensive intervention , while others were left alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children in the intervention schools were weighing less than those in the other schools . <p> Sadly , they were not , although the students were deeply familiar with the importance of activity and proper nutrition . The children who got intensive treatment also ate less fat , going from 34 per cent to 27 per cent in the total diet . <p> " It was not enough to change body weight , " said Benjamin Caballero of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health , the study 's principal investigator . <p> Dr Fatima Cody Stanford , an obesity medicine specialist at Harvard , recalled her own experiences in the 1980s . Children with obesity were sent to a " healthy lifestyle " clinic where they were told to eat healthier food and to exercise more . Often , it did not help . <p> She recalled a 15-year-old boy who weighed more than 300 pounds ( 136 kilograms ) . " Maybe he should switch to skim milk , maybe increase his vegetables , " she told his parents . " Oh , he 's working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase it to an hour . " <p> That , she said , is how she was taught , and looking back " it breaks my heart " . Stanford now believes that the advice set up obese children for failure . <p> What do the guidelines say should be done now ? <p> It 's not that lifestyle interventions can not work for some . The American Academy of Pediatrics says that children and adolescents who are overweight and obese should be offered " intensive behavioural and lifestyle treatment " , which is the most effective intervention short of medications and surgery . <p> The most effective programmes involve at least 26 hours of in-person treatment over three to 12 months and include the family . The treatment focuses on nutrition , physical activity and behaviour change . The expected result ? A decline of 1 to 3 points in BMI . <p> But intensive programmes are not always available , and insurers often do not pay for them . The academy advises that doctors instead should " provide the most intensive programme possible " , referring families to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recreation programmes . <p> The underlying message is one of urgency . In a significant departure from past advice , for example , the academy recommends that children 12 and older with obesity should be offered treatment with any of the few approved drugs , including newer ones like Wegovy ( a brand name for semaglutide ) that elicit significant weight loss by suppressing the appetite . <p> Those 13 and older with severe obesity should be offered bariatric surgery , the academy says . These are drastic ( and expensive ) interventions for doctors and parents to contemplate , but the authors of the recommendations note that obesity rarely ends without a concerted effort . <p> Are researchers focusing too much on weight loss ? <p> Although it generally raises the risks of other health problems , many people with obesity remain healthy . Weight loss is not the only route to good health , and one of the perpetual risks of intensive medical intervention is that a child with obesity may come to feel stigmatised . <p> The conundrum here is that researchers say these children usually are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxious and depressed , and far too often they are made to feel that they are failures who lack the willpower to control their weight . Doing nothing may deepen their isolation , not lessen it . <p> Will the new recommendations make a difference ? <p> If they are " fully implemented and supported " , the guidelines may lower obesity rates in children , said Dr Stephen Cook , an obesity specialist at the University of Rochester . But there are no guarantees . <p> Insurers and the Food and Drug Administration treat obesity differently from other chronic diseases . People with obesity may need drug treatment for a lifetime , for example . But insurers have insisted on paying only for short-term treatments , like six months ' or a year 's worth of medications -- if they pay at all . <p> " If there continues to be no payment for treatment services , health systems will not put resources to delivering this care , " Cook said .

There are the " I 'll just have one drink or I wo n't sleep " men - generally tech nerds and start-up founders , all more interested in being sharp for their morning meeting than having a fun , flirty night out . Then there are the " I do n't ingest stimulants of any kind because my body is a temple " people .

Not to mention the fact that " drunk " by no means equals " fun " . I once walked out of a date when the guy turned up already hammered . But , if I 'm being absolutely honest , it does put me off .

" I definitely would n't have got together with my husband if we had n't been three gin and tonics down at a party one night in the early noughties . " <p> Though one friend does point out that if you begin a relationship getting tipsy in pubs , there is the inevitable moment , a year in , when you realise you 've " set the bar too high and your partner thinks you 're going to be that fun forever " .

But in the strange world of modern app dating , you have very little information to go on before you choose to meet up , and the tiny cues you might get from a person 's profile ( made up of a few pictures and a mini CV ) can be enough to put you off , or intrigue you . It forces you to filter people in a way you might not in real life . If I met someone at a party or at work , got to know and like them , and it just happened to be that they did n't drink , I can safely say it would n't be a problem . On an app ?

@@96840231 <h> ' Let them watch Netflix ' - what can be salvaged from the wreckage of the failed TVNZ-RNZ merger <p> Last year 's Budget had allocated around $23 million to the planned merger but the finance minister has not yet confirmed how much of that had been spent ahead of the announcement that it would not go ahead . Photo : RNZ / Michelle Tiang <p> Opinion - The government 's decision to abandon the Aotearoa New Zealand Public Media ( ANZPM ) Bill came as no surprise after months of increasingly negative speculation . Officially , it stems from the prioritisation of " bread and butter issues " during a cost-of-living crisis , but it 's hard not to see this as a significant policy failure for Labour . <p> The bill had proposed to establish a multi-platform media entity comprising RNZ and TVNZ , with substantial public funding . The proposals were controversial , however , and generated over a thousand select committee submissions . <p> Key criticisms included the new entity 's governance and independence , the balance between its commercial and public charter obligations , its long-term funding and its impact on the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were remediable . Revisions proposed by the Economic Development Science and Innovation committee largely addressed the concerns about political independence , and improved the provisions for under-served audiences . Questions about long-term governance and future funding could have been addressed after the entity was established . <p> Unfortunately , the work of the Strong Public Media Programme , which underpinned the bill , was sidelined by the pandemic ( ironically while measures to support the commercial media sector were developed ) . Otherwise , there would have been considerably more time to make the necessary refinements before and after the bill 's first reading . <p> But in an election year , political polls and campaign tactics too often outweigh considered deliberation . The Labour government certainly has to take some responsibility for not articulating the potential benefits of the ANZPM model more vigourously and coherently . <h> Lost opportunities <p> Ironically , the media were part of the problem , too , especially when they had vested interests in the outcomes of the bill . Amid the cacophony of criticism , the possible merits of the ANZPM model - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - were frequently overlooked . <p> So what do we stand to lose ? For all its faults , the ANZPM model was not just about merging TVNZ and RNZ so they would continue their existing services . It was intended to provide a framework for the future development of multi-platform public media services capable of addressing the needs of a wide range of audiences . <p> Particularly for TVNZ , the new charter represented a significant shift in its operational priorities . This was not straightforward , given it would have continued to generate commercial revenue . <p> But the new model recognised the gradual decline of a commercial business model based on linear schedules geared to selling mass audiences to advertisers . The question of what purpose a commercial TVNZ will serve in the long term has been left unresolved . <h> Politically unviable <p> An unprecedented $NZ109 million was earmarked for delivering a multi-platform public charter . Coupled with the reallocated component of the NZ On Air contestable fund and the existing RNZ funding , the new entity would have received around $200 million per year in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provision of a full range of content capable of meeting the needs of diverse communities on all platforms . Claims that such expenditure was outrageous and unjustified in a cost-of-living crisis presumed public media services are merely " nice to have " rather than a cornerstone of democracy . <p> Such assertions also ignore the fact that New Zealand has historically under-invested in its public media services . Even with the additional funding , we would still lag well behind other comparable democracies such as Denmark , Sweden or Finland . <p> Given that the previous TVNZ charter was undermined by inadequate funding ( Treasury extracted more in dividends than the Ministry of Culture provided in charter subsidies ) , one might have hoped Labour would have learned a lesson : under-investing in public media will never deliver the services we need as citizens , not just as consumers . <p> The prime minister has indicated NZ On Air and RNZ will receive some additional funding . But the decision to ditch ANZPM makes it unlikely substantial spending on public media will be deemed politically viable by any government for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two government terms of public media policy work now potentially wasted , can anything be salvaged from the wreckage ? One possibility could be to use the additional RNZ/NZ On Air funding to establish a " public service publisher " model . <p> This could solve one of the big structural limitations in the current public media arrangements . Eligibility for the contestable NZ On Air fund currently requires a guarantee of broadcast or distribution . <p> A public service publisher model would see NZ On Air provide contestable funding for typically under-provided genres , with a guarantee of distribution on RNZ 's non-commercial platforms . <p> This would significantly increase the scope of local content . If one of TVNZ 's digital channels were designated non-commercial , that too could become part of a public service publisher framework ( similar to the former TVNZ7 ) . <p> In fact , this model has already been piloted . The temporary Joint Innovation Fund set up in 2018 saw NZ On Air and RNZ collaborate to commission and distribute a range of content . One of the spin-offs is the local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government and other civic issues . <p> This required no new legislation , no structural overhauls and relatively little funding .

@@96899230 <h> Sponsored : How a herd testing routine is helping the Koning Family <p> Francis and Lea Koning have been dairy farming in Lincoln for over 10 years . <p> They initially milked 450 Holstein Friesian cows but have recently reduced their numbers to 400 as they relinquished the lease of a lifestyle block which was sold for development . <p> Production ranges between 1500kg and 1700kg per hectare and they aim for around 460 kilograms of milk solids per cow . For the last seven years they have been on an efficiency and profitability drive and they rear about 25% replacement calves . <p> Lea uses EZ Link during a herd test to help speed up the process . <p> The Koning 's relationship with LIC goes back almost 32 years -- ever since they started sharemilking north of Hamilton . Herd testing has been a constant throughout those years with four herd tests per annum but it was n't always that way . <p> " Coming from Raglan we never herd tested back in the 60 's and early 70 's . When my brother started , my Dad had tears in his eyes when he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could n't afford it , " says Francis . <h> Through the good times and the bad . <p> Today , the Konings know the value of herd testing . Even in the toughest times when the milk payout dropped to $4 for a couple of years , they still maintained three herd tests before going back up to four as Francis explains . <p> Lea and Francis Koning know the value of regular herd testing . <p> " I strongly recommend herd tests . Cows can be deceptive ... there might be a fatter looking cow that the farmer thinks is no good and wants to offload and low and behold she 's doing 550 or 600 on solids and doing it efficiently . <p> Francis and Lea also believe herd testing is a great asset to keep their somatic cells counts down which average around 75,000 through calving which is really pleasing for them . <p> They have also taken up pregnancy testing with herd test milk samples . <p> The Koning 's invest in adding animal health checks to routine tests . <p> " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shed and they 're not getting poked about or anything , so from that point of view it 's really good , " says Lea . <p> The Konings are also big supporters of GeneMark and were one of the earliest farmers to get into DNA parentage testing some 14 years ago . Francis had read that some 30% of calves were not properly matched to the dams and really wanted to ensure they had accurate records and good strong bloodlines with no inbreeding . <p> Of course , today when they start AB mating , the Konings can get the AB Tech to check for inbreeding straight away with the DataMATE handheld giving them total confidence that there 's no inbreeding , taking away the guesswork . <p> In the end , confidence is what herd testing is all about .

@@97010232 <h> 2023 Volvo C40 Recharge P6 review <h> Words : Kyle Cassidy Photos : Tom Gasnier <h> Volvo has its C40 Recharge on the ground in NZ . This stylish newcomer is the brand 's first all-electric vehicle , surprising given Sweden 's love of EVs . Is it one for Kiwis to consider ? <p> It 's almost hard to believe that the Volvo C40 is the company 's first all-electric offering . The Nordic countries are big on EVs -- 43 per cent of cars sold in Sweden last year had a plug -- and yet Volvo is only just setting off on its BEV journey . Sure it 's had a few plug-ins but we guess launching Polestar has been at the forefront of the overall corporate effort . They say the Polestar 2 was supposed to be a Volvo , before they changed tack and used it to launch the new all-electric brand . <h> So what is the Volvo C40 exactly ? <p> It uses the same platform as the XC40 , which can now also be had as an EV , and coincidentally , the Polestar 2 . Think of it as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought the look worked ; thank those proportions then for it 's a well balanced visual package . <p> We should probably be using its full name , the Volvo C40 Recharge , which means it has a battery . On test is what they call the Plus , the front driver with a 170kw/330Nm motor drawing power from a 67kWh battery . The WLTP range claim is 438km , while efficiency is rated at between 18-19.3kWh/100km . Your mileage will vary of course , especially if you 're utilising its 1500kg braked towing capacity . <p> There is an evil twin , the Ultimate which gets a pair of motors , for a total of 300kW and 660Nm . It has a bigger 75kWh battery and a sprint time of 4.7sec , 2.7sec quicker than that of the Plus . The Ultimate 's range is said to be 450km , with efficiency pegged between 19.8 and 22.3kWh/100km . <h> Does the Volvo C40 Recharge get a rebate ? <p> Unfortunately not . While some brands are very keen to get their electric wares on the road at $79,990 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road ( which is already up $2k since they first announced pricing ) . We guess that will ensure exclusivity and help Volvo NZ balance the demand and supply issue . The Ultimate C40 costs an additional $15k . There 's also the XC40 BEV available with the same electric bits in the more conventional body style , and it 's $2k cheaper but still wo n't get you that rebate dosh . They are , however , fee neutral . <p> There are no optional extras ; what you see is what you get . Included is a glass roof ( which does n't come with a shade blind ! ) , a charge pad , a powered tailgate , heated chairs front and rear , and a wheel warmer , LED lights and 19s . Typical of any Volvo , there are lots of safety systems looking out for your well-being . These are cleverly devised , with few false alarms . The lane keeping function is n't quite the control freak others can be ( it switchable , and then it stays off ) while the active @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognition is coming in handy too with all the new lowered speed limits about the place . Ka pai Waka Kotahi . <h> What 's the Volvo C40 like to drive ? <p> Glad you asked . Step in ( easy to do thanks to high-set seats ) and it 's all rather Volvo-centric , so traditional buyers , fear not . Although there 's one oddity in that as soon as you 're seated it 's ready to go ; just pull the lever into D and you 're away . And when you 've parked , simply push the P button , and get out . It feels unnatural not physically turning something off but you do get used to it . <p> Like the Polestar 2 , the initial throttle response is rather subdued ; there 's no immediate rush of torque here . That helps neutralise wheelspin and torque steer ( no doubt aiding efficiency too ) but once rolling , the pull flows more readily , with more of that instant surge in the 30-70km/h zone . It 's all rather quiet too , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride is sorted . While there 's a controlling tune to the dampers , it 's only the larger road lumps you tend to notice . <p> The only mode to fiddle with concerns one-pedal driving , and that 's either on or off . We preferred the latter . According to the power gauge -- no tacho here remember -- you can accelerate up to urban cruising speeds using around 25 per cent of the available power , and then lift off . It 'll then glide along , coasting for a handy distance . The brake pedal action is sound , blending the motor regen and friction brakes sweetly . In one-pedal mode , the regenerative braking effect is rather aggressive , and it 's snatchy when moving around at parking speeds . <h> Is it sporty in nature , or just looks ? <p> Volvo is n't so interested in sporty dynamics these days , which suits the C40 . However , it still manages to keep itself in shape through the bends . While it 's heavy , the weight is low and well distributed so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between roll control and ride decorum . You can click ' steering feel firm ' in one of the driver assistance menus , which gives the helm more resistance and the driver just enough of an idea of what 's happening . There 's a minor amount of torque reaction under heavy right foot abuse , and you might get a bit of TC intervention , but otherwise it 's just so darn sorted . <p> As to how far you 'll get , it all depends on how and where you drive . With a mix of urban , motorway and rural/highway running we covered 245km and averaged 17.7kWh/100km . When we returned the C40 , the battery had 32 per cent remaining , and the distance to empty suggested it was good for a further 130km of travel . Somewhat ironically , we did n't recharge the Recharge but figure on re-energising once or twice a week , and adding the cost of a smart wallbox to your purchase . <h> Is the Volvo C40 Recharge a practical car ? <p> Volvo seats tend to be on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case here but they do support you well . The interior is what they call a leather-free environment , so there 's textile upholstery , a convincing fake cow wrap on the steering wheel and on a few other surfaces while the rest are lined in carpet and thoroughly decent soft plastics . The Volvo infotainment system is an easy-to-master contraption , even with just one home button as the menus are logically ordered . Its best trick is Google integration , especially its voice command function and mapping . You get four years of digital services too . <p> The rear vision is n't that flash through the fastback tailgate and the reversing camera relays a somewhat truncated image , peering out from under the bumper . It 's a five seater with enough room in the rear for adult legs ( and bodies ) while that roofline does n't plunge too low making entry no real chore . It does restrict outward vision a tad , but then you are in the cheap seats . That tailgate design eats into the overall load capacity but underneath the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over 400L available . And split folding is straightforward , the seats flopping down to form a flat floor . There 's no spare tyre of course while the puncture repair kit is stored up front in the frunk , where there 's enough space to store the charge cables as well . <h> So , worth a look then ? <p> The Volvo C40 Recharge is thoroughly competent , going about its business without fuss . It 's an easy thing to drive and live with , while being easy on the eye . It 's not one that excites but it does n't do much wrong either . So , as long as you can sleep knowing you wo n't get that rebate money while your Model Y-buying neighbour did , yes , it 's worth a look . <p> NZ Autocar is New Zealand 's leading automotive magazine .

There 's a new line-up with the Life dropped ( well , once current stocks are gone that is ) , and Crosstar the new entry point , which now starts at $30,700 , ( or $31,500 in must have two tone paint option ) . The RS meanwhile comes in at $36,700 . The Luxe Sport , as it 's now known , is $37,000 ( a rise of $2000 since it was introduced ) . The RS and Luxe get a $3930 rebate on account of their 3.8L/100km , 91g/km emission figures , while the Crosstar retains its ' conventional ' 1.5-litre four , and is fee neutral . <h> Inspired by the Type R <p> They say the Jazz RS incorporates Type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long bow and see it has R inspired styling . This includes an aero-honed design on the front end complete with air ducts in the front bumper to smooth the airflow and a honeycomb black grille . Also making the grade are RS-specific side sills , rear bumper and a discreet spoiler . <p> Inside there 's a sportier theme with yellow stitching on the wheel and seats , the latter featuring a perforated suede like trim . <h> RS tuned suspension <p> Along with 16-inch alloys , the RS has its own suspension tune with new dampers , roll bars , spring rates ( reduced in the front , stiffer in the rear ) and RS-specific bushings . <p> Behind the wheel you 'll find the new ' deceleration selectors ' that look like paddle shifters , but because the e:HEV models have a direct drive transmission ( so no gears then ) , these alter the level of brake regeneration . Being Type R inspired , there 's also a Sport driving mode . <h> Does the Honda Jazz RS have more power ? <p> The e:HEV powertrain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 253Nm , while the engine ( which is chiefly used as a generator for the battery ) has 78kW and 127 Nm . It can also drive the vehicle at higher speeds ( dubbed direct-drive in e:HEV lingo ) to improve the economy . But primarily , the e:HEV uses the electric motor to get you around . <h> What 's the safety rating for Jazz ? <p> As Honda does n't sell the Jazz in Australia , there is still no ANCAP safety rating for this popular model . But the RS comes with the full Honda Sensing Suite , including AEB , lane keeping , adaptive cruise and auto high beams . It does have a five-star Vehicle Safety Risk Rating , which is why it is eligible for the rebate . <h> Is it an RS to drive ? <p> We had a brief taster of the RS , the new ' deceleration selectors ' handy when it comes to dialling in your desired level of regen , although it could be stronger still on its maximum setting . It 's a deceiving drive the e:HEV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even though it has no transmission in the classical sense . Best not to think about it , and enjoy what is a smooth little powertrain . The RS has a firmer ride than we remember the Luxe having , but also turns more diligently , with more resistance to cornering forces <h> It should sell ok then ? <p> Given its popularity previously , the RS should help Honda move 2000 Jazz models this year as it looks to claim the number one spot amongst private buyers in this small car space . <p> Honda is also getting two crucial new models with the ZR-V e:HEV arriving along in May while late in the year , the all new CR-V arrives , which will also have an e:HEV powertrain . <p> NZ Autocar is New Zealand 's leading automotive magazine .

@@97164231 <h> A tale of two forests <p> I am privileged to have grown two pine forests -- the first a production pine forest , or woodlot , and the second a conservation pine forest . <p> There is a huge difference -- let me explain . <p> My production pine forest was pruned and thinned . The prunings were in two lifts and approximately half of all the branches were removed from selected trees . Then all the unpruned trees were cut down or thinned , with the result that my steep slopes were now littered with almost three-quarters of my planted trees , cut down and rotting . <p> Unfortunately my steep slopes ( like other steep slopes on the East Coast ) attract gale-force foehn or katabatic winds that from time to time sweep down our gullies , and as my unsupported trees grew to maturity some were blown over , to add to the rotting prunings and thinnings . And then on harvest we added the slash . . . all ready to be moved by a storm , and this is what happened . <p> Then I planted my second forest -- a conservation pine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees competing . I have a strong forest , no trees have been blown over during storms , and I have no slash . But I do not have nice clearwood logs and I have no profit . <p> The evil in the camp is the carbon credit scheme . My conservation pine forest is not eligible , but many production forests are . Carbon credits are distorting the marketplace and our downstream farms , communities , bridges and beaches are paying the price . <p> Experts ( so-called ) will probably dispute what I have said , but I know what I am seeing with my own eyes . <p> Carbon credits are allowing wealthy overseas industrialists and others to buy vast areas of prime New Zealand farmland to gain carbon credits to balance the CO2 spewing from their factories . <p> The vast earthworks involved in the building of tracking and roading and skid sites , the constant use of high-powered logging machinery and trucks , plus the additional costs of the huge and regular beach clean-ups , and the rebuilding of bridges destroyed by slash ( water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the communities devastated during flooding and the disruption to the NZ economy , make the payments for carbon sequestration gains very questionable . <p> The solution , as I see it , is to allow only conservation pine forests ( no pruning or thinning ) and natives on our steeper slopes above waterways , and only those plantings would be eligible for carbon credits . This would reduce the wood run-off during floods and cyclones to a manageable amount . <p> I was a soil conservation officer with the then East Cape Catchment Board for several years , have ridden most eroding East Coast back country , and watched the folly of blanket production pine foresting . And I am convinced the current assessment of carbon credits is faulty for production pine forests . <p> Although there is no simple solution , a change in direction is definitely needed . 
@@97164232 <h> Claytons inquiry : not what we asked for <p> Minister Nash 's disingenuous attempt to gerrymander the investigation into the forestry industry is n't an acceptable compromise . <p> Here 's what happened , who is to blame and how we stop it happening again . Readers can make up their own minds . <p> 1 ) The History <p> Much of the damage to the East Coast environment and communities that is attributable to the forestry industry expansion had already begun before the first pine tree was planted . <p> Native forests were cleared from gullies right down to the water courses when the early settlers established pasture on the hills , leaving unstable land and creek beds vulnerable to the eroding effects of excessive rainfall events . <p> The current forest estate was initially a response to the severe erosion on hill country throughout the Tairawhiti region , but much of the damage was already done . Big slips still occur even within the forested estate itself . <p> Successive governments have supported the expansion of an industry that has unfortunately consumed everything in its path and depopulated much of the landscape in the process . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the excesses of this seemingly uncontrollable monster , in the form of a local by-law that restricted the planting of pine trees on anything other than classes 6 and 7 marginal land . <p> In hindsight , had that restrictive law still been in place and the policing of the resource consents that ensured the planting of gullies with permanent trees been a priority , the damage we are experiencing now would have at least been limited to the trash that was already in the water courses . <p> Therein lie two of the culprits when apportioning blame -- and ( again in hindsight ) it is fair to say that the forestry companies are less responsible for the carnage because they can say , with some justification , that they were only doing what they were allowed to get away with . Although that might be regarded as a cynical observation , it is still the truth . <p> The council 's lax policing of forestry consents was , in my humble opinion -- and hopefully will also be in the eyes of the inquiry -- another major contributor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Real Culprit <p> In spite of Nash 's deliberate attempt to transfer his Government 's share of the blame to the relatively innocent forestry companies , the truth is that the Labour Government 's obsession with achieving its emissions reduction targets has allowed the associated carbon economy to add to the destruction of our rural communities . <p> I have been telling government for years that they could have achieved all those ideological targets without encroaching on a single hectare of quality grazing land , simply by reintroducing the old by-law as a means of restricting the forestry to classes 6 and 7 marginal hill country , of which we have an abundance . <p> It seems a simple and reasonable solution but unfortunately we are not talking about reasonable people here . The chances of us being able to present these ideas to the inquiry are about as likely as me winning Lotto . <p> 3 ) What Now <p> Apart from establishing the truth about the forestry industry and the implications of retaining it as part of our revenue mix , we must be prepared to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mitigation against the threat of climate change . <p> I believe it is possible for us to do so in a way that allows the forestry industry to peacefully coexist along with our traditional ( although reduced ) livestock industry and a fully irrigated 18,000 hectares of Poverty Bay Flats . <p> " The relatively innocent forestry companies " I really have an issue with this statement as our beaches and rivers aptly demonstrate . The forestry industry existed long before this Government . " Restricting the forestry to classes 6 and 7 marginal hill country , of which we have an abundance . " Having an ecological monoculture has always been part of the problem . Having this type of farming may see productivity gains in the short term . Systems such as permaculture would pay dividends financially and ecologically in the long term .

@@97247230 <h> Review : Cocaine Bear <p> You might remember , back in 2006 , a film phenomenon called Snakes on a Plane . Samuel L. Jackson played an FBI agent flying a mob witness from Honolulu to Los Angeles , taking on a planeload of venomous snakes that had been released as a murder weapon . <p> It was as silly as it sounds , but it was one of the best examples of a film selling you exactly what it said on the tin . <p> There was a plane and there were snakes . You ca n't say you did n't know what you were letting yourself in for . <p> This year 's equivalent is Elizabeth Banks 's Cocaine Bear -- a comedy horror about a black bear in an American national park who has stumbled on some lost bags of the illicit white powder and developed a taste for it . <p> Woe betide anyone or anything that comes between her and her Colombian marching powder . <p> The national park is in Chattahoochee in Georgia and the bear roams around a landmark improbably called Blood Mountain . But I looked it up -- it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realism there . <p> When a plane carrying lots and lots of duffel bags full of cocaine bricks -- enough to build a decent sized retaining wall or barbecue patio to use the New Zealand system of measurement -- goes down , the pilot ditches the cargo but his parachute fails to open . It 's now open season on all that blow . <p> It 's 1985 , so much hilarity is assumed at all the haircuts and fashion statements and an equivalent amount of nostalgia for the music . Depeche Mode is prominent and composer Mark Mothersbaugh gets to pretend to be Miami Vice era Harold Faltermeyer . <p> While the bear is getting higher and higher , several groups are closing in . <p> Two middle-schoolers are wagging school for the day to go and visit Secret Falls -- they 're also real by the way , marked on a map and actually kind of famous , so not actually all that secret -- but they stumble on one of those bricks just before the bear gets there . <p> The owners of the drugs are on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all so there 's a degree of urgency on their part -- O'Shea Jackson , Alden Ehrenreich and the late Ray Liotta are the bickering criminals . <p> A park ranger -- played by the great Margo Martindale -- is wanting to find some quiet time to be with environmentalist Peter ( Jesse Tyler Ferguson ) but ends up helping the mother of one of the kids -- played by Keri Russell -- which is a frustrating exercise for all concerned . <p> Until the bear turns up again , that is , when frustrating does n't even begin to cover things . <p> I almost forgot Isaiah Whitlock Jr . as Dave , the cop who is hot on the heels of the drug dealers and who adds a layer of complication to proceedings . <p> Unfortunately , for me , I was reminded of a film I saw much too young -- possibly unlawfully but definitely unwittingly -- called Grizzly about a massive bear on the loose in a state park . <p> Pretty traumatising for an eight-year-old and I can report that Cocaine Bear leaves nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disembowellings . Hilarious . <p> For the first hour or so I found myself doing what I often do when I 'm not terribly engaged in the story and do n't care much for the people . I get distracted and look at other things , the background , who is playing small roles . <p> For example , is that Keri Russell 's husband Matthew Rhys in a cameo as the failed parachutist at the beginning ? Why , yes it is . <p> The film was mostly shot in Ireland which is why there are little tidbits of Irishness snuck into the set decoration . <p> The fast-food restaurant where we first meet Ray Liotta at the beginning is leprechaun-themed , for example , and there 's a giant roadside billboard that appears a couple of times advertising a bar called O'Hagan 's . <p> But , by the final third -- it 's only 95 minutes long which is a blessing -- when all the extraneous comedy characters have been disposed of and we are left with two mothers determined to protect two sets of cubs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coke -- well , I started to find things a lot more engaging . <p> It actually does feel like a different film at that point , one that cares a little for its characters and encourages you to do so too . A little . <p> Cocaine Bear is rated R16 for graphic violence , drug use &amp; offensive language . ( a lot of the cursing is done by children which bothered me more than I thought it would . Am I being too prudish ? ) Anyway , the film is playing in cinemas across Aotearoa now .

A whole cabbage will currently set you back about $5 - a bargain compared to the more delicate greens that are soon to be in short supply . <p> Photo : David Todd McCarty for Unsplash <p> Cabbage may be ubiquitous , but it responds well to a wide range of culinary treatments far more exciting than the stinky boiled stuff you might have been forced to eat as a child . Fun fact : not only is boiling the easiest way to overcook a cabbage ( and therefore release the kind of sulphurous stench that puts even the most devoted cabbage fan off their dinner ) , but it also has a deleterious effect on its nutritional profile . <p> A whole , uncut cabbage will keep for two weeks in the fridge . Once it 's cut , the clock starts ticking . If just using half or a quarter at a time , sprinkle the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vegetable bin ( this will stop it drying out ) . If the cut side does go brown , just trim it off before proceeding with your next cabbage feast . As always , use your nose : if a cut piece of cabbage has a bit of a pong , it is likely to be past its best . The following recipes will help inspire you to use up a whole cabbage before it dies a sad and stinky death in your fridge . <p> Photo : The Matter of Food/Unsplash <p> Widespread renewed interest in all things fermented has done a lot to increase cabbage 's coolness cachet . Kelly Gibney 's Sauerkraut requires just three ingredients ( two kinds of cabbage and salt ) . Bonnie Le Gros uses just one cabbage variety and adds caraway seeds for a traditional northern European Raw Fermented Sauerkraut . Both conveniently make the most of cabbage while its cheap and help you store it away for a later date . <p> Photo : Jonathan Farber/Unsplash <p> Barbecue season is still upon us - just - and a spiced slaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Try Allyson Gofton 's Cumin-Spiked Coleslaw or Jess Daniell 's Fast Slaw , both of which can be whipped up in about 10 minutes . <p> Cabbage plays a crucial supporting role in a variety of Asian or Asian-inspired dishes . Annabel Langbein puts it to work in these ingenious Crispy Pork Rolls ( all the joys of an excellent spring roll , without deep-frying ) . Anna Jones turns a small white cabbage into Korean Carrot and Sesame Pancakes , while Josh Emett whips up a Japanese-inspired Prawn Okonomiyaki ( possibly the best-ever vehicle for Kewpie mayonnaise ) . <p> If , after all those recipes , you 're just craving a bit of old-fashioned boiled cabbage , shred it finely and cook it in a pot of boiling salted water until just tender ( about 3-5 minutes ) . Drain well , then toss through a generous slice of butter . Season well with salt and pepper and serve immediately .

They perform a wide range of different roles for the university that allow for teaching and research operations in several different faculties , each encompassing a suite of schools that have very different needs . It is an enormous structure of employees that extends beyond the public perception of wealthy academics . There are academics of all levels of career progression , from postgraduate students to professors , who research and teach . There are people who work in management , finance and administration . There are teaching specialists , technicians and other support staff . All of the schools and faculties are serviced by people who work in health and counselling services , the graduate school , student services , security and maintenance . The university operations and culture rely on retaining highly diverse , highly motivated professionals . <p> The University of Auckland promotes itself as the number one university in the Pacific region : internationally recognised for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 2021 , all made while contributing to fair , equitable and sustainable societies . It promotes itself as an institution that is honouring the principles of Manaakitanga -- Caring for those around us in the way we relate to each other and Whanaungatanga -- Recognising the importance of kinship and lasting relationships with a priority of supporting people and communities over profit . " He aha te mea nui o te ao . He tangata , he tangata , he tangata - What is the most important thing in the world ? It is people , it is people , it is people " Taumata Teitei <p> The above-and-beyond service and duty of care that is the core-value of staff at UoA was intensified under the emergency of a global pandemic . The University implemented a voluntary leaving scheme , put a freeze on hiring and rallied its staff to give their best under the strain , we were all in it together . The entirety of tertiary education had to rapidly be moved online and there were fewer staff to implement the changes . The Academic and teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care for distraught people going through their own pandemic-induced traumas . Graduate Teaching Assistants were repurposed as course content creators - the role of professors - and teaching teams rallied in overtime to continue providing tertiary education to a generation of thinkers . Some of the lowest paid colleagues on campus assumed personal risk to continue critical operations on-site ; PhD students , technicians , animal caretakers , maintenance workers and security staff risked their lives to ensure that all students remained supported and research operations continued . These people ( many on casual or fixed-term contracts ) all worked enormous amounts of unpaid overtime to keep it all going . It is still commonplace for staff to willingly work unpaid overtime to maintain the business-as-usual operations of the university . It has become the norm , it is expected of us . It is so expected of us that the UoA has implemented a multiplier for professional staff that ties their performance review to what they will receive in the cost-of-living adjustment . If we do not perform our above-and-beyond service , we may receive 50% or 0% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UoA during this pay dispute have revealed that the ideology and sentiment that the university promotes itself as fostering is indeed present in the hearts of its staff . It is exemplified in their actions , but it is not upheld by university management or financial decision makers . Upon the announcement of the first strike action , the employer was very quick with an unnecessary yet effective countermeasure . It pressured its workers with the promise of blanket suspensions &amp; wage deductions should they voice their concerns via a legal strike . Many struggling employees were forced to settle for a smaller pay-check rather than fight for a fair one . <p> With the continued stonewalling in negotiations TEU actions escalated to withholding student grades and work-to-rule actions -- no more unpaid overtime from us until you actually look at the key concerns around workers rights and offer a pay increase that matched inflation for all staff .

It is clearly a war on unions that this university intends on winning . <p> Some examples of this union busting behaviour : <p> 1 . Currently union members are paid less than they would receive if they were not in the union . This encourages new staff to opt out of the union immediately ( because we are all struggling and need the money ) . This also encourages union member to leave the union for more pay . <p> 2 . The University has stated that they will not back pay the union members after the deal is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we a losing money every single day that we stand here trying to hold the university to account . <p> 3 . The employer has been stonewalling negotiations since they began last year and drag their heels as much as possible . The longer this takes the more money union members lose and the more money the uni saves AND more people will be forced to leave the union because they ca n't afford the necessities in life . <p> 4 . The current offer to the TEU is retaining of the long service and retirement benefits for union members but we will need to agree to a lower pay increase than we could receive if we left the union . This offer does not address the concerns with the TUPU modifiers and would create 2 tiers of pay where union member are paid less for being in the union . This will encourage people to leave the union or not sign up in the first place . <p> 5 . Strike action is being responded to with unnecessary pay docking . We are struggling to make ends meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't respond with extended striking that will stall business as usual operations for the university . This means that short strikes and partial strikes are our only tool and the university will absorb small impacts and so can drag this on until the staff can not absorb the lost income anymore . <p> A far more sinister consequence of folding to the university offer here is the message it sends about unions . UoA is a thinking centre of NZ -- allowing the dismantling of our unions is like telling the country that unions have no place in NZ society . For collective progression everywhere we stand together , in solidarity . <p> Across this period of negotiations ( more than 6 months ! ) , staff have been trying to communicate with Andrew Phipps , Head of HR. 100s of emails have been sent in reply all chains and not a single response from Andrew Phipps has been received .

Our stories are compelling . Each point raised should be investigated and expanded upon in-order for the emergence of a sustainable and equitable workplace culture . Andrew Phipps should read them , respond to them and investigate the complaints . Many members wrote to the employer pointing out that good faith did not require docking of pay for legal strike action .

From there , staff questioned the nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff 's struggles amid a cost-of-living crisis in New Zealand 's most expensive city .

We support each other . We care for our students and their places in the world , we know the value of our labour to society and voluntarily drive ourselves to burnout in order to keep it all going .

What is a Least Developed Country ? <p> The Least Developed Countries ( LDCs ) are countries listed by the United Nations that exhibit the lowest indicators of socioeconomic development across a range of indexes . All LDCs have a gross national per capita income ( GNI ) of below USD$1,018 ; compare that to almost $71,000 in the United States , $44,000 in France , $9,900 in Turkey and $6,530 in South Africa according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have low scores on the indicators for nutrition , health , school enrolment and literacy and high scores for economic and environmental vulnerability , which measures factors such as remoteness , dependence on agriculture and exposure to natural disasters . <p> There are currently 46 LDCs , the vast majority of which are in Africa see box below . The list is reviewed every three years by the UN Economic and Social Council . Six countries have graduated from LDC status between 1994 and 2020. <h> 2 . What are the challenges facing the least developed countries ? <p> Today , the 46 LDCs are home to some 1.1 billion people , that 's 14 per cent of the world 's population , and more than 75 per cent of those people still live in poverty . <p> More than other countries , LDCs are at risk of deepening poverty and remaining in a situation of underdevelopment .

How can the United Nations and the international community help LDCs ? <p> The UN system 's efforts to reverse the increasing marginalisation of LDCs in the global economy and to put them on a path to sustainable growth and development date back to the 1960s . <p> Since then , the UN has paid special attention to LDCs , recognising them as the most vulnerable in the international community and granting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the DPoA will help LDCs to address the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting negative socio-economic impacts and enable them to get back on track to achieve the SDGs including addressing climate change . <p> The full text of the Doha Programme of Action is available here in the 6 UN official languages . <h> 5 .

But officials are cracking down on inappropriately dressed travellers and wild behaviour from tourists who continue to disregard local rules and customs . <p> So much so the term ' Bali Bogans ' was born , which often describes Aussies seeking a cheap and carefree holiday , with travellers usually chasing happy hour rather than sunsets . But the Bali Tourism Board is hoping to put an end to badly behaved tourists , announcing a new campaign designed to crack down on how foreigners act and dress , particularly around sacred and religious areas . <p> The plan was announced on Tuesday by Balinese officials and will involve using billboards to build awareness among visitors and educate tourists on how to behave in cultural settings .

" <p> So just how long will Selby-Rickit keep playing ? <p> The self-confessed preseason hater questions her decision at the start of every season , but once she gets to travel with her team-mates and steps on the court , she falls in love again . <p> She called it a " miracle " to play as long as she had , and counted herself lucky to have never had a major injury . <p> " I do n't know when there will be a time . <p> " I do n't know if there will be a time I completely go away from it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love coaching and all that kind of stuff . <p> " Surely I 'll still be involved in some way , even if I 'm not playing .

Photo / 123rf <p> OPINION <p> A storytime session with two drag queens at Tauranga Library this week attracted debate on social media and complaints to the council . It came after protests at a similar event in Auckland . Parent SonyaBateson gives her account of the Tauranga performance . <p> Dressing up can be magical . <p> Donning a cape , a princess dress , a firefighter helmet , or a pair of sparkly heels can change your posture , your voice and your mannerisms . <p> Watch a child playing dress-ups with their friends and you 'll see what I mean . <p> They 'll put a cheap plastic crown on their heads and suddenly be speaking like they 're Lady Schnozzlebottom of Willoughby Manor , drinking Darjeeling out of the finest porcelain , complete with extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ padded muscles will see you strutting around , hands on hips , your voice growing a shade deeper and louder as you greet your friends with a boisterous clap on the back instead of the usual brief handshake . <p> That 's what makes it fun . <p> For just a few moments , you get to pretend you 're someone else . You can come out of your shell and do things your Average Joe or Josephine self would usually be too shy or self-conscious to do in normal circumstances . <p> It 's one of the many reasons why drag performances are so popular . <p> Now , let me tread carefully into a topic I am familiar with as an observer but , as a straight , white , cisgender woman , far from an expert in . I do n't claim to speak for anyone in the LGBTQ+ community and am sharing my own observations based on what I 've seen and read . <p> Disclaimer done , here goes . <p> Drag is ostentatious . Everything is exaggerated -- the hair , the makeup , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and routines , fine-tuning that alter-ego until it is basically a fully-fledged being , separate from its creator . <p> Some drag performers can be true divas -- they 'll get to the stage channelling Mariah or Cher , and their command of the stage forces you to give them their undivided attention . <h> Advertisement <p> Some are incredible dancers with the fitness and strength of a pro athlete -- in heels nonetheless . Others will ham it up and have you in stitches with their comical , over-the-top expressions and often crude jokes . <p> It 's a display of self-expression and opulent fantasy . It 's something that takes a lot of skill and courage to execute . It 's an art form . <p> Then the performers will take off their heavy wigs , remove their glittery make-up , and swap their sky-high stilettos for sneakers ready to blend back into the crowd . <p> Drag has traditionally been performed mostly by gay men , although it 's also not unheard of for any gender or sexuality to dress in drag . <p> And drag is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belief in some circles . <p> A trans person could potentially be a drag performer , true , but from what I understand , that 's a relatively rare occurrence . <p> As an article in The Conversation put it : " Put simply , ' transgender ' refers to a personal gender identity and an authentic , lasting sense of self . In contrast , ' drag ' is a temporary and deliberate performance of gender .

Ready those clutchin ' pearls , people . <p> Sunita Torrance , aka CoCo , came out in a purple velvet suit and voluminous crimped wig , complete with glittery blue eyeshadow . <p> CoCo lip synched to a song , read a hilarious book called The Book With No Pictures by BJ Novak , that had the kids in fits of giggles , played the fun toddler action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Erika , aka Daniel Lockett . <p> Erika entered , wearing a pink rock'n'roll-style dress with white polka dots and a sky-high Marilyn Monroe-esque blonde wig .

That 's all that happened . <p> There was no Secret Gay Agenda to convert children to , I do n't know , Dragism ? Gaydom ? Lesbianity ? <p> There was no burning of bibles , handing out of anti-straight pamphlets or tutorials for how to draw the perfect drag eyebrows .

@@97442238 <p> The weather and its impacts have naturally dominated the national conversation for the first two months of this year . It will dominate life in the affected communities for much longer . <p> For everyone else , attentionis turning back to more universal , shall we say , bread and butter , issues . There , the storm clouds are also banking up . <p> The enduring problem is inflation and the cost of living , which does n't look like getting any better . The fervent hope of Americans that their inflation was coming under control is turning out to be a false dawn . <p> The US economy is still running too hot and the Federal Reserve will have to keep pouring cold water on it by further hiking interest rates . <p> Here the problem is the same , or worse . The economic stimulus during Covid from extra government spending and monetary policy was even greater as a proportion of the economy than elsewhere . The restrictions on the border were more disruptive to the labour market than in other countries , and the desire to crank nominal wages for political reasons more intense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimum wage has risen by a vast 44per cent . <p> Ministers also hiked the effective minimum wage for migrants much higher , and both flowed through to increased labour costs . We were in a pro-inflationary environment long before the rest of the world . <h> Advertisement <p> All this was predictable , and indeed predicted by some . Inflation has been made worse by unexpected things like the Ukraine war and now the weather events in Hawke 's Bay and Gisborne particularly , which will create further shortages in food and labour , but the base problem is poor economic policy choices both before and during the pandemic . <p> The question is , what to do about it ? After all , the Government has declared the cost of living crisis will be its absolute focus this year ( along with the weather events ) . <p> They have very limited options . If they play around with the Reserve Bank 's inflation target , as some have started to suggest , they would rightly be seen as waving a white flag to inflation . <p> They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they 've spent so much time discouraging people from coming here that it will be hard to change the unwelcoming reputation we now have . Anyway , we are now competing with the rest of the world , who want grow their labour markets , so this wo n't be a quick fix . <p> If they increase taxes to help slow the economy , they will make things worse for families . And if they introduce envy taxes , they wo n't achieve much revenue , or much impact on inflation . They would just encourage more people to leave , which would be a brake on economic growth . <p> They could try to keep wage increases under control , particularly in the public sector where they have the most influence . However there does n't seem much chance of that , given the latest minimum wage increase ( where they simply hiked it again to match inflation ) and their likely capitulation in the face of public sector unions which are demanding above-inflation pay increases . <p> Which brings us to the one lever they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40per cent of economic activity . Restraining it would help reduce inflationary pressure on the economy . Restrain it enough and it would be possible to provide some tax relief to struggling families as well . <p> But restraint is the key . If the Government just borrows more to increase public spending or to give handouts to families , that will push inflation up further . <h> Advertisement <p> The good news is that there is huge capacity to cut public spending . Government expenditure has increased by an unbelievable 65per cent since 2017 . Some of it was for the pandemic , but that should be winding out by now . Blind Freddie can see we have a bloated public sector which has gorged itself on free money . <p> People have made much this week of consultancy spending , but however big that is , it 's small beer . The real problem is a general looseness with the public purse , and the hare-brained schemes ministers have been spending all the money on . There has been virtually no fiscal discipline for five years . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The list of ridiculous flights of fancy is long and undistinguished . Bike bridges , illusory light rail projects , public-sector mergers , cancelled public-sector mergers , think big-style power schemes , the list goes on and on . We even had the spectacle of a minister this week defending spending $16 million on a cancelled project . <p> You can be sure what we see is the tip of the iceberg . As one who 's been there , I can confidently predict billions and billions will be able to be wrung out of the current Government 's spending and nobody outside the Wellington vortex would notice . <p> There could easily be enough money to both restrain government spending overall to help control inflation , and give the long-suffering taxpayer a much-needed downpayment on tax reduction . As a result of tax increases and bracket creep , New Zealanders are collectively paying more than $40b more tax this year than they did six years ago . No wonder they are feeling the pain . <p> The Government 's problem is that their mismanagement of core public services like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public and people working in those sectors will be wanting to spend even more money there . The health reforms have so far sent the health sector backwards if anything , and education performance is in a nosedive while the ministry in Wellington grows like Topsy . Plus , Hawke 's Bay and Gisborne in particular need money for cyclone recovery . <p> To meet the reasonable aspirations of New Zealanders , this year 's Budget will need to be crafted with the sort of surgical discipline that we have n't yet seen from this Finance Minister . He will need to spend money in the right places , slaughter great herds of sacred cows , and provide something to alleviate cost-of-living pressures , all without increasing borrowing . He will also need to demand accountability from the public sector for performance . <p> If he took a zero-based look at the gargantuan increases in spending on his watch , then with a lot of hard work all that should mostly be possible . If he does n't , then I think we are in for a bumpy ride . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , teacher strikes , people turned away from emergency departments and highly visible wasteful spending , could all add up to a looming winter of discontent . <p> - Steven Joyce is a former National Minister of Finance .

" <p> To make cleaning more convenient , Milsom said the suspension system and internals of the helmet had been replaced by what Pacific called the Haloflex system , which allowed them to be taken apart more easily for cleaning once firefighters returned to the station while still protecting the wearers ' heads . <p> With a set of spare parts available to swap out , Milsom estimated the new helmets could be taken apart , cleaned , reassembled and back in service in around 15 minutes . <h> Advertisement <p> The design of the foam padding on the inside of the helmet took 1.5 years to develop to make sure it was durable and chemical-free . <p> " A big part of the R&amp;D team 's development was researching closed-cell foam so that we could make sure the products we were putting in do n't absorb carcinogens or wo n't hold on to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also key for the R&amp;D team to make sure the helmet required no tools to deconstruct . <p> Other changes to the helmet include making it lighter than the previous generations , and particular focus was put on the weight distribution to make sure it was comfortable to wear . <p> " Firefighters around the world are always looking to make the helmets more comfortable , " Milsom said . <p> The inside of the F20 firefighter 's helmet developed by Pacific Helmets .

@@97499235 <h> The Front Page : The massive gap in New Zealand 's arts funding <p> New Zealand artists regularly battle to get their work funded here . Photo / Getty Images <p> New Zealand artists regularly battle to get their work funded here . Photo / Getty Images <p> New Zealand loves to celebrate our finest artists excelling on the global stage . What we are n't as good at is giving artists the financial support in New Zealand in order to make their art locally . <p> Victoria University of Wellington drama lecturer Dr James Wenley points to a recent example of the General Arts Fund to explain the disconnect between the amount of money available and demand from New Zealand 's artistic community . <p> Wenley tells The Front Page podcast that arts practitioners and arts organisations that do not receive recurrent funding from Creative New Zealand often have to rely on the General Arts Fund to support their initiatives . " This is a big funding pool that many creatives go to , " Wenley says . <p> " To manage the workload , they introduced a cap of 250 applications . But within 24 hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that cap . " <h> Advertisement <p> Wenley says this set an unfortunate record in that it was the fastest time in which all the available slots were taken up , leaving many artists frustrated at the reality that they would n't even have the opportunity to present their ideas . <p> " It really shows the demand and the number of artists and arts organisations , where money could really make a difference in terms of getting the art out and making it accessible to people , " Wenley says . <p> " It shows the current funding system is broken . It 's a very difficult state of affairs for people that are applying for money . People put hours , days and sometimes weeks into these applications , and to even have the opportunity to be considered is really tough . " <h> Advertisement <p> " The new Australian government has made arts a centrepiece of their first term in office , " Wenley says . <p> " After a six-month consultation , they 've just come out with what they 've called the Revive National Cultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minister Albanese is talking about putting the arts back to where they 're meant to be : ' at the heart of our national life ' ... It really speaks to the idea that Australia values the arts and they see what it does for the economy , culture and social life . " <p> So why is New Zealand being left behind by Australia in this regard ? Has this been a missed opportunity for New Zealand 's Labour Party ? Should art be left to fend for itself on the free market ? And given the cost-of-living crisis and cyclone damage , has art fallen even further down the priority list ? <p> Listen to the full episode of The Front Page podcast to hear Dr James Wenley answer these questions and more . <p> * The Front Page is a daily news podcast from the New Zealand Herald , available to listen to every weekday from 5am. * You can follow the podcast at iHeartRadio , Apple Podcasts , Spotify , or wherever you get your podcasts.

After some discussion she said about the Church , " the Church has lots of land , it has lots of buildings , it has lots of money , but is losing its people . " When she said that , her comment had a familiar ring to it . <p> The question is , why is the Church worldwide diminishing in some places , in large numbers ? One suggestion is that church has not always been what we think . At one time , in its history , it was a place of almost terror . Attendance at church was compulsory , not to attend and not to give money brought serious consequences . <p> The Church had the power to send one to heaven but could also send you to hell . Money could get you from hell and could also get you to heaven . The Bible was written in Latin and unable to be read . The Bible could only be read and interpreted by a priest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For example , the place of women in the Church . Women have been seen not fit to hold office in the Church . While this changing progress has been slow . <p> Over a 12-year period I had the privilege of asking mainly men why they no longer went to church . They were all willing to talk . The answers were quite varied , but two themes came through . One was , the minister was always too busy to visit their homes , and the other was , it was a phase of their lives they went through and no longer held any meaning and they left to follow more meaningful commitments . They felt no animosity against the Church . <p> The Church I know dates from the 1950s , it was a place of warmth of friendship . The minister always visited the home and was a welcome guest . In the community he conducted the weddings and funerals , conducted baptisms , lead the Anzac service and gave a blessing on any business , home or swimming pool . Even to non-Church people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Research has revealed a rise worldwide of fundamentalism . This can deprive people of love and money . <p> The main thrust I found in my ministry I found very early . <p> A woman phoned me . Her husband was sick and wanted to talk to me . Sensing urgency in her voice I went immediately . I sat by his bed and he talked . He said he was a very wealthy man , he owned farms , he owned buildings in the city , money to buy whatever he wanted . He had few friends . Sadly , he said none of it now meant anything to him . In his weak condition he pulled himself to his elbows and he grabbed my hand , looked me in the eye and said " I have just found there is one thing in life money ca n't buy . It 's free " . Saying those words , he fell back on his pillow and never said another word . I sat for a while in quiet contemplation . I then took my fingers from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years I have had reason to remember his words . All come into this world for a purpose , we are given the ability to find that purpose . Unfortunately , my friend found it on his death bed -- to love . He had put " to love " last in his life and realised he should have put it first . <p> Why did Jesus come into this world ? The gospels give us the answer . In Jesus we read of a man who came to a world because the world had lost its purpose . Every encounter with Jesus , every story of Jesus in the gospels is an encounter with God 's love . In all this the Church still has much to do . <p> The encounter with the dying man happened nearly 40 years ago . That the encounter I had -- with almost the same words -- happened recently , tells of the need to still learn more about the man from Galilee.

@@97629230 <h> America ( and the World ) holds it breath as Trump faces arrest <p> Donald Trump claimed on Saturday ( early Sunday NZ ) that his arrest was imminent and issued an extraordinary call for his supporters to protest as a New York grand jury investigates hush money payments to women who alleged sexual encounters with the former president . <p> Despite no evidence that Manhattan prosecutors have given any official notice to him or his lawyers , Trump declared in a post on his social media platform that he expected to be taken into custody on Tuesday . The message seemed designed to preempt a formal announcement from prosecutors and to galvanise outrage from his base of supporters in advance of charges widely seen as coming soon . <p> In its direct encouragement of protest , and his capital letter demand to " TAKE OUR NATION BACK ! " the post evoked in foreboding ways the rhetoric he used shortly before the insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6 , 2021 . <p> After hearing from the then-president at a Washington rally that morning , his supporters marched to the Capitol and tried to stop the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , breaking through doors and windows of the building and leaving officers beaten and bloodied . <p> ... news that Trump may well be arrested this Tuesday alongside his direct plea to MAGA supporters that they take to the streets to ' Take our Nation back ' is the moment we have all waited in fear of . <p> How crazy are MAGA supporters ? <p> TDB Recommends NewzEngine.com <p> How fanatical are they going to be to defend this orange fascist ? <p> Will the Emperor with no clothes on suddenly fold like the coward we know he is or will he become a martyr to a new kind of American Fascism ? <p> This has the potential of rupturing existential fears as demented Qanon realities fracture like a multi-verse implosion .

@@97629231 <p> Shaw , delivering the party 's State of the Planet address in Auckland alongside co-leader Marama Davidson , warned those in attendance that a National/Act Government would be the " most reactionary , race-baiting , right-wing government " in decades . <p> ... that 's right , James . TDB has been pointing this out for sometime and have asked repeatedly for your Woke Green Activists to stop providing ammunition for ACT because they will implement the most extreme conflict policies ever . <p> Is it credible for James Shaw to criticise Labour when he is the Climate Change Minister ? <p> Is it credible for Marama Davidson to criticise welfare reform when she is the Minister for Homelessness ? <p> Not really eh ? <p> The Greens are angry . <p> So what ? <p> This was always the inevitable end point of taking those vacant Ministerships in the first place . <p> James and Marama provided Labour with political camouflage by appointing them Ministers outside parliament . <p> Climate Change and Homelessness is bad ? <p> Well who are the Ministers ? <p> Oh , James and Marama . <p> See , who cares if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have gained sweet fuck all and have nothing to show for the last 3 years ! <p> The strategy I argued the Greens needed to take in 2020 was to demand 5 bottom lines for the Ministerships or refuse to join the Government and threaten Jacinda with 3 years of attacking them from the Left . <p> Instead they took the Ministerships with no power and are in the exact powerless position I were warned they would end up in . <p> So what needs to be done now ? <p> The Greens have to wake up and became far more tactical and strategic . <p> They should immediately call for a Green Party/Maori Party Election Hui and discuss an agreement between the two Parties to co-operate and present Labour with a united front of 10 bottom lines the Greens and Maori Party would demand in return for supporting Supply and Confidence . <p> These 10 bottom lines have to be policy within the first 100 days of a new Government so that voters knew these changes and the relief they would bring are worthy of their belief and support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 bottom lines would need to be Broadchurch Economic Justice , not radical identity politics dogma or it will become an immediate weapon used by the right to frighten the middle . <p> The 10 bottom lines have to have immediate material impact . <p> Nationalise Early Childcare -- make a free public option

front in negotiations with Labour so that even if Labour only needed one of them to make the 51% majority , Labour would have to negotiate with both of them without undermining either . <p> The Greens

That , dear TDB'er 's is why MMP has risen to infamy . A desperate attempt to generally diffuse , to distract , to bore , to psychologically immobilise and to stupefy .

" <p> Labour needs the greens just as National needs Act . Labour and Nats are happy for their co partners to score a few points against their masters because they need both smaller parties to get over the party threshold .

Every second word was ... " if you vote for the Green Party ... you must vote for the Green Party . " The thing she did not ever mention is why we should really vote for the Green Party . They have to get rid of her quick ! She is waste of good taxpayer money . She is taking the piss . <p> Just as Act will not be able to get National to be their cypher , neither will the Greens be able to get Labour to be theirs . <p> Because neither of the two major parties support partners can go anywhere else , they do n't have the power to demand bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obviously the minor parties will get something , in fact something quite substantial , good faith coalition negotiations demand that . However , neither major party is radical , even if their support parties are . Given the major parties are likely to be 80% of the government , they will also get 80% of the policies . More particularly they will dictate the feel and look of the government . <p> In my view it is on this issue that the election will be decided . Which of the two alternative governments looks the most risky ? Will the major party in each of the alternatives look like they will simply roll over to their coalition partners ? <p> I expect that the major media outlets will push the two leaders very hard on this issue .

@@97649236 <p> Parliament has a charming tendency to gift people with very odd job titles : Black Rod , Serjeant-at-Arms , Herald of Arms Extraordinary to the Queen . You get the idea . <p> These fun titles are also often misleading . The person titled Black Rod is not a stick ( surely no surprise ) , the Serjeant-at-Arms is not a sergeant and is not armed . The Leader of the House is not the person in charge of parliament ( that is the Speaker , who mostly listens ) . <p> Also confusingly , parliament 's job titles often throw linguistic shade on opposition MPs by prefixing their jobs with the word " shadow " , adding an ominous air to them . Senior opposition MPs are known as the Shadow Cabinet ( very Edgar Allan Poe ) . <p> Among their number is Michael Woodhouse whose job is Shadow Leader of the House . <h> Shadow Leader of the House <p> On the radio version of The House we regularly talk with the Leader of the House ( LOTH ) , which is currently Grant Robertson . <p> The LOTH is the government minister with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair the Cabinet Legislation Committee ( approving new bills ) , they write the Order Paper determining what government bills will be debated and when , they really do have significant sway on what happens inside the house . <p> So what does their opposite number , their ' shadow ' do ? Michael Woodhouse can clear up one potential misunderstanding immediately . <p> " Shadowing somebody means to sort of follow them around I suppose , which is not a very good descriptor of the role either . " <p> That was not likely to be anyone 's conclusion though . It is difficult to imagine Woodhouse meekly wandering around after Robertson like a dazed intern . <p> The short answer is he represents the National Party ( but not the wider opposition ) on all the sorts of things that the LOTH looks after . That involves quite a few things . <p> " Behind the apparent smooth running of parliament is , of course , a pretty big machine that requires quite a bit of organisation and cooperation , and the role of Leader of the House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One key aspect is the cooperation Woodhouse alludes to . Parliament has many rules for how things should work , but MPs regularly agree to disregard them in order to be more efficient , fairer , or more open . Woodhouse describes it as pragmatic . <p> " But that can only be done by a broad consensus , or what 's known as ' near unanimity ' of a committee called the Business Committee . " <p> It is usually done in a pretty productive and relatively friendly way . It does not all happen in the room though . It works best if the various whips , the LOTH and the Shadow LOTH chat regularly and trust each other . <p> I asked Woodhouse how they stay in touch . My timing was perfect as it turned out . <p> " I just got off the phone with the Leader of the House , to talk about a quite important matter for this week . ... Grant Robertson has demonstrated a willingness to collaborate . And I 've really appreciated that . <p> " We 're not going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government has the prerogative to set the order of what happens . But he has involved me , and I think the house will work better for it . So I really appreciate that dialogue . " <h> The headline you will never see <p> If MPs ' actions mirrored their acolytes ' social media posts , they would mostly hurl excrement at each other across the debating chamber . In reality MPs may shout at each other a lot , but they do still manage to maintain a professional capacity to negotiate and cooperate . <p> Woodhouse points out that political parties actually agree more than the public realise . <p> " In legislation that happens more often than not , ... opposition parties might say something like ' they 're not going far enough or fast enough ' , or that they would n't do certain elements of what 's in a bill . But overall , the broad direction can be supported . " <p> " But those do n't make good headlines . ' Opposition agrees with Government ' is never going to be splashed across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your news-on-the-hour . But it happens much more than people realise . " <p> Woodhouse points out that this is most clearly illustrated when a new government arrives and yet keeps progressing legislation left unfinished by the previous government . <p> When Labour took over from National some bills were dropped , others were amended , but some needed little change to continue through the chamber . Woodhouse notes that that goes both ways . <p> " If there was a change of government in the future that will be the same in reverse . " <h> Strategy <p> I ask Woodhouse if the shadow leader of the house is involved in decisions about tactical and strategic decisions for action in the house : what policies and bills to oppose , what debating lines to champion , what lines of questioning to follow ? <p> " Yeah , there is a ... team of tacticians , of which the Shadow Leader and my deputy are part . The whips are also involved in that , but their role probably is more in carrying out that broad direction . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managing a party 's troop of MPs day-to-day . This is most noticeable in the debating chamber where they are always managing their party 's action , including rostering their colleagues and making the on-the-spot calls during debates . <h> Appealing to the Speaker <p> If you did not know it was part of their job you might think the leader and shadow leader of the house ( and the whips ) were pushy , difficult people . They regularly interrupt proceedings to appeal to the speaker for things to go their way . This is just part of the job . Woodhouse explains : <p> " There is a set of rules for debate , known as the Standing Orders , and the speaker over many , many years has issued rulings on that . So there 's another big thick book called Speaker 's Rulings . I guess I 'm a bit of a geek when it comes to the rules of the house , and so I 've got a good working knowledge of that . <p> " The leader or shadow leader and the respective whips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaches of Standing Orders , or highlighting areas where the speaker might want to take a closer look at the way in which for example , Question Time would be going . It 's not a rule , but it is a convention that those sorts of contributions are left to the house leader and the whip . " <h> Anticipating action in the house <p> " We will try and anticipate debates , " says Woodhouse . Obviously it helps enormously if the other parties have advance warning of what is likely to be debated during the following week . There are various ways they divine this . Most obviously they are formally told the broader strokes . <p> " The leader of the house has a set-piece at two o'clock every Thursday advising the house of the likely business in the following sitting week . Now that looks like a bit of a superficial set-piece . Actually , it 's very helpful for us , so that I can spend the next couple of days with the whips , anticipating what will be needed for that , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week . So you know , that 's quite important . " <p> That set-piece on Thursdays is called the Business Statement . It is not the only source of information . The weekly Business Committee meetings include planning for upcoming events like special debates or the various set-pieces that scatter across the parliamentary year . <p> There is also the Order Paper which outlines the order of business for the day , but that can change radically with only a few hours warning , so is best not relied upon . <p> The relationship with whips and especially the leader of the house ( Robertson ) is crucial , especially when things are coming up last-minute . For example a few days before we spoke , Woodhouse had been alerted that a bill relating to cyclone recovery was being hastily prepared and would be introduced under urgency in the coming week . ( The debates had not happened yet when we spoke ) . <p> " Now , the bill that will be debated on Tuesday afternoon , did n't exist ... when the LOTH indicated that it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make sure that we could get a draft of that as soon as it was in its final draft stage . I could get that out to the relevant spokespeople , so that they could get a sense of whether or not the bill can be supported by National . And then I worked with both them and the Whip 's Office , to highlight when they may have been needing to be present in the house , where we might expedite a shorter process , and so on ; all of that takes quite a bit of time and effort . " <p> As it transpired , that is exactly what happened . The various parties even agreed a deal to get the bill passed in a single week without urgency required for anything ( except its introduction ) , which allowed for a very brief select committee process to happen as well . None of that would be possible without trust , cooperation and those relationships . <p> As well as ( unseen by anyone ) an utterly exhausting week for the Committee Clerks ( cramming a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drafters at the Parliamentary Counsel Office who pulled off all-nighters to get it across the line . <p> As Woodhouse noted early in the interview , below the surface of the apparently smooth running of parliament there are a lot of hamsters sprinting like Usain Bolt , out to make it all happen .

In addressing topics as varied as crime , the ports , superannuation , infrastructure and immigration , a common theme has emerged : Aotearoa seems unwilling to address big , long-term issues . <p> Yet , as we head into the election cycle , our main parties seem utterly fixated on one issue , and one issue only : the cost of living . So are we at risk of again kicking important cans down the road , no matter who gets elected ? <p> Currently , we have Hipkins on the one side slashing policies , while National on the other has been slow to release its major policy ideas -- heaping pressure on both politicians to deliver something substantial in the coming months . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policies when the Budget is announced in May . <p> " It 's clear he 's not going to do much before Budget , " says Wilson . <p> " Budget will be when we really discover what 's there . " <p> National is similarly tied to this timeline , with du Plessis-Allan suggesting that Luxon may be tempted to wait until after the Budget to unleash National 's thinking on the big issues . <p> " Obviously , the Nats are going to come out with policy , the question is how much and when , " says du Plessis-Allan . <p> " They are leaving it until after the Budget , I think . But if I was their strategist , I would tell them not to leave it much longer because it is starting to do real damage to the brand of Luxon .

@@97741234 <h> Analysis : Teachers need a lot of things , another curriculum ' rewrite ' is n't one <p> Analysis - Less than a fortnight after teachers staged a national strike , education was back in the headlines with the National Party 's release of its curriculum policy - or " rewrite " , as leader Christopher Luxon described it . <p> In a nutshell , the policy would require primary and intermediate schools to teach at least an hour a day each of reading , writing and maths . Learners in Years 3-8 would also be tested on their progress at least twice a year - not unlike the controversial ( and subsequently dropped ) National Standards system from 2010 to 2018 . <p> Prime Minister Chris Hipkins responded by arguing the school curriculum should ideally be a bipartisan issue rather than a political football : " Parents , kids , teachers deserve to know that we 've got a stable curriculum regardless of who the government is . " <p> Clearly , we all want the best learning outcomes for our nation 's children . But there are deep ideological divisions in the debate about how best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curriculum will inevitably become a partisan issue as the election year unfolds . <p> Behind this immediate contest of ideas , however , sits a larger question : does the education system need yet another upheaval when the curriculum is already undergoing a " refresh " ? <p> The national curriculum and school curriculums work in tandem to balance national consistency with localised enrichment . As part of the curriculum refresh now under way , Te Mataiaho/The Curriculum Framework will replace the New Zealand Curriculum . <p> This model establishes key learning stage " progressions " . While it does n't go as far as National 's proposed year-by-year testing system , it does set out five consecutive phases : for years 1-3 , 4-6 , 7-8 , 9-10 and 11-13 . This replaces the current system of eight overlapping levels across years 0-13 . <p> The curriculum refresh also includes improvements to literacy and communication , and numeracy , including explicitly describing outcomes as a component of all learning areas . As part of the literacy and maths strategy , a common practice model is already being developed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . <h> Teachers on the front line <p> The upshot of all this is that extensive curriculum work is well under way - and teachers and school leaders are already grappling with the implications . But the National Party curriculum policy implies these changes wo n't go far enough . <p> If enacted , the proposed curriculum rewrite will require teachers to get their heads and hearts around even more change . This will include overseeing a new standardised testing regime in reading , writing and maths for years 3-8 - rather than solidifying their understanding of the current refresh . <p> More curriculum change is assuredly not what teachers were calling for when they went on strike on 16 March . Rather , they were drawing attention to working conditions and pay scales that have n't kept pace with inflation . <p> Mainstream reporting and social media posts overflowed with teachers and principals sharing experiences of increasing concerns about the wellbeing of students and staff . They spoke of overwhelming workloads and inadequate funding to support students with complex learning and behavioural needs . <p> Christopher Luxon addressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " In addition to teaching , you have become the front-line response to complex social , educational , housing and wellbeing challenges . " <h> Beyond the school gates <p> Of course , a strong curriculum and clear milestones for progress are important . But we also need to recognise that quality education occurs within a complex milieu of wider social and economic policies . <p> If Chris Hipkins ' desire for a bipartisan approach to education were to work , it would be good to see the educational policies of different political parties directly address the funding issue for schools . <p> Beyond that , how does school funding intersect with other policies targeting inequality and inequity outside the school gates ? The same day National announced its curriculum policy , child poverty again made the headlines .

@@97844237 <h> In a world of overlapping emergencies , more shocks are sure to come . Policymakers need to be prepared to react before the next one unleashes widespread inflation again . Interest rate hikes are not the answer <p> Public Policy / opinion <p> In a world of overlapping emergencies , more shocks are sure to come . Policymakers need to be prepared to react before the next one unleashes widespread inflation again . Interest rate hikes are not the answer <p> At the end of 2021 , The Guardian published one of my first newspaper commentaries , in which I criticised the rush to use interest-rates hikes to combat inflation and reminded my readers of the history of a long-neglected alternative : strategic , targeted price controls . At the time , this was judged to be an act of heresy . <p> The history of price stabilisation goes back centuries , from the mists of classical China ( my own research focus ) to the major crises of the past century : World War II , the Korean War , and the stagflation of the 1970s in the United States . In each case , price-stabilisation policies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflation , " but at doing so in a fair and socially stabilising manner . Their primary purpose was to attack profiteering ( from wars , famines , and disasters ) head-on . They have tended to work in highly concentrated markets , and when implemented before inflation spirals out of control , while performing poorly otherwise . And when carried out in democratic societies , through a mobilisation of the population behind a common project of price restraint , they have been massively popular -- especially when weighed against the alternative of austerity . <p> But by late 2021 , that history had dropped out of the common sense of economics . My intervention hit a nerve . Right-wing and libertarian social media erupted in fury , and even many liberal and progressive economists found strong words to reject my intervention . At the University of Chicago , students received an exam asking what a " real economist " would say about price controls . To my detractors , a company 's right to set any price that it can get away with ( " whatever the market will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be endured if we wanted them to go away sooner rather than later . If a policy response was warranted , the only way to address rapid price increases was either to wait it out or impose high interest rates , even though these ultimately would crush small businesses , workers , and indebted households . " There is no alternative " -- or so they said . <p> From theory to practice <p> In February 2022 , my colleague , Sebastian Dullien , and I set out to establish that there are indeed feasible alternatives to macroeconomic tightening . We proposed a fiscally financed price cap on basic household consumption that would preserve market prices at the margins . This led to another round of criticism from economists . But our proposal also received strong endorsements from a wide range of interest groups . <p> Fast forward to September 2022 , when I found myself appointed to a German government commission charged with designing a price-stabilisation policy to address the energy crisis following Russia 's invasion of Ukraine . There , we developed the so-called " gas-price brake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were subsequently enshrined in German law . <p> Germany is not alone in implementing a price policy . Across Europe ( and in the United Kingdom ) , governments have implemented various forms of price controls to contain the war 's fallout in global energy markets . The European Union has enacted a gas-price cap , the G7 has imposed a price ceiling on imported Russian oil , and the US government has leaned on the price of oil by releasing supply from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve . <p> Moreover , leading economists have rushed to endorse selective , targeted price controls . By January of this year , Paul Krugman of the New York Times , for example , was suggesting that it might not be so foolish after all to respond to price explosions with price policies , even though he had criticised this approach earlier . ( It remains to be seen whether the University of Chicago will be revising its exam . ) <p> As my co-authors and I illustrate in a new working paper , sectoral bottlenecks and price shocks in systemically significant sectors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today 's inflation . As prices rose , so did many profits , creating effects that have since reverberated through the economy as other sectors scrambled to make up for higher costs , and as workers demanded cost-of-living adjustments . Now that a previously stable system has become unstable , higher interest rates can only add fuel to the fire . That is why it is so important to avail ourselves of more socially acceptable alternatives . <p> Consider the US . During the pandemic shutdowns , when oil prices were collapsing , producers closed their highest-cost wells . But when demand recovered , the recovery in supply lagged . Producers saw that they could keep costs down and prices up by leaving the less-productive wells closed . The result was a massive windfall . Gasoline prices briefly hit $5 per gallon , on average , and the fossil-fuel industry 's profits broke new records . <p> In this type of situation , an oil-producing country can pursue selective price controls -- without even resorting to fiscal transfers . Far from hindering production , this approach can spur higher output @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ margin per barrel , producers will find that producing more is the only way to earn a higher gross profit . This is the dirty secret that most economists have refused to acknowledge , but which practical price fixers have discovered time and again . If done right , a price-control policy 's effect on output can be the opposite of what textbooks predict . <p> Of course , things get more complicated when you are dealing with economic warfare . Whereas a Texas oilman is in the game for one reason , Russia has other objectives aside from money . Following the G7 's and EU 's decisions to cap the price on imported Russian oil , the Kremlin responded by threatening to cut output . Whether it will do so , or by how much , remains to be seen , given its dependence on revenues from hydrocarbons . <p> Another complicating factor is climate change . One might ask whether it is even desirable to bring down the price of fossil fuels , given the need to accelerate the shift to renewables . On the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes to changing their consumption patterns radically in the short run . Tragically , the same communities that are hit hardest by both climate change and fossil-fuel pollution are also among the main victims of oil-price shocks . <p> Fortunately , combining a price cap with a sufficiently high marginal price , as the German gas-price brake does , can both preserve production incentives and protect basic consumption needs from a price shock . It also prevents the kind of explosive fossil-fuel profit growth that we saw last year . By making Big Oil more attractive to investors ( compared to renewables ) and strengthening the vested interests that have long denied that human activities have spurred climate change , such windfalls are counterproductive for an urgently needed green transition . <p> A new stabilisation paradigm <p> The new openness toward the strategic use of targeted price controls is welcome , because it acknowledges that inflation is not always purely macroeconomic in origin . Managing the kinds of micro shocks in essentials that we have suffered in recent years requires expanding our toolbox of stabilisation policies . A window for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fresh air coming in . Now that we have dispensed with old shibboleths , we can take another look at economic history to reconsider conventional wisdom and develop fast , fair , effective ways of managing new kinds of economic instabilities . <p> A new stabilisation paradigm is urgently needed . We are living in a world of overlapping emergencies -- climate change , a pandemic , mounting geopolitical tensions -- and more shocks are sure to come . Policymakers need to be prepared to react before price shocks ripple through the whole system again , leaving inflation and widespread social and economic harm in their wake . Such efforts must focus on the sectors that matter most . As my co-authors and I show , an input-output analysis can be used to identify systemically significant prices , thereby helping policymakers prepare for future emergencies . <p> In an age of radical uncertainty and disruptive change , economics must move beyond the old playbook . There are no ready-made solutions or magic bullets that will solve the unprecedented problems we face . For economics to be part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , old and new . To confront the enormous economic-policy challenges of our time , there can be no substitute for a culture of openness toward different approaches . <p> Remember we welcome robust , respectful and insightful debate . We do n't welcome abusive or defamatory comments and will de-register those repeatedly making such comments . Our current comment policy is here . <p> What you post about regularly makes perfect sense to me . I was just wondering ... If the Energy Return on Investment of digging up a fossil fuel source is low or negative it will stay in the ground . If that fuel source is dug up and used to build renewable energy systems ( which ultimately still rely on fossil fuels ) can this create a better energy efficiency thus raising the Energy Return on Investment ? <p> In short : Can renewables ironically make it more economically feasible ( in an energy sense ) to dig up more fossil fuels ? <p> In physics terms , the need is to build , or adapt , our energy infrastructure to be able to exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goal . <p> If renewables can ONLY be built using fossil energy , they do n't quality . They will have to be built by themselves . Yes , we can - presumably will - build the first round using FF , but if solar panels can not power the building of solar panels .......... then we are looking at a stop-gap ( the life of a decaying panel , say 25-39 years ) . <p> Yes , we will be building whatever we build - Onslow comes to mind - using FF . Whether we can maintain the grid , post FF , is the bigger ( and currently being unasked ) question . <p> When energy hits an EROEI of 1:1 or lower , it will never be used , never dug up . Economists do n't understand this ; they believe the making of money somehow produces whatever you want . The bigger problem comes as you approach 1:1 - down around where we are now , and lower , the economic system goes further and further into debt , stranding more and more of the forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may well cave in - collapse - which will render the above 1:1 remainder , un-extractable ( who pays who , ex FOB-type trust ? ) <p> We know that ! We knew it as recently as 2008 , and nothing changed . Do you know why ? Because a relatively few people , who had a lot , would lose a lot . Not all of it by any means , but a lot . And the alternative was to allow a lot of people who had a little , to lose it all <p> And that will apply to any ' solutions ' enacted today . In an economic System of carrot-and-stick when the stick is n't used the carrot gets devoured . <p> Conclusion ? Interest rates are going far higher than most anticipate ( or need to go ) but that is all that we have that will work . A Big Stick . <p> Interest rates are going far higher than most anticipate ( or need to go ) but that is all that we have that will work . <p> All that we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> We also have tax . The UK has increased taxes on the upper-middle and above so they have less money to spend while the UK Govt has more money to spend paying down debt and rebuilding infrastructure and services . <p> The time to rebuild infrastructure and services was yesterday ( i.e. , 2021 and before that ) . Any money a government spends on an already stretched system amid chronic labour and capital shortages is likely to be inflationary and most of it would find its way back into the pockets of higher-income earners . <p> Governments squandered much of the easy money era over the last 15 or so years waiting for free markets to fix structural issues in their national economies . Now they are pressing down on the accelerator when it 's time to ease up on the fiscal spending . <p> Its pretty rubbish to complain those people and entities werent ready .. after years of boom and loose monetary policy and with 12-24 months of warnings of possible high rates .... plus multiple boom bust cycles taught to economists and business people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent in high tech industries i am all for new fangled stuff but only where there is merit . <p> In this case there is a well proven , expected way to solve inflation which is to raise the OCR higher faster - which would solve the problem , and people that managed their risk accounted for that eventuality and wont be affected much if at all - in fact they are almost hoping for it . <p> the only reason its not being used is the fear of a recession and asset price drop - but again most smart people hedged against those outcomes anyway as they knew that would be the outcome and the reserve banks have been warning to prep for it for 12 months . We are simply not doing it for fear of upsetting the few who mismanaged their risk .. SVB , credit suisse , overleveraged infvetors etc .. instead we heap inflationary pain on the poor . <p> High tech engineers use a term - KISS ( ' Keep it Simple ' ) ... for a reason . It includes the rule to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nt broken - without a very good reason . in the same way - the way to solve inflationary problems is to raise the OCR and let those that were foolish learn a lesson .... and those that managed their risk against the anticipated outcome survive .. its how the world works . <p> Germany is not alone in implementing a price policy . Across Europe ( and in the United Kingdom ) , governments have implemented various forms of price controls to contain the war 's fallout in global energy markets . The European Union has enacted a gas-price cap , the G7 has imposed a price ceiling on imported Russian oil ... <p> If you want society to thrive , the people need to have real-world skills in things like design , engineering , manufacturing , and construction . China has this in abundance . That is the key to China 's rise . Link <p> and they have borrowed and spent trillions ( likely more than $6 ) at a local body level on infrastructure , much on white elephants and now to be paid back at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> Nobody is claiming their method are 100% effective across the board but there are lessons the West could learn ( or re-learn ) on the engineering design and project delivery prowess displayed by the Chinese . <p> The problem has been the CPC trying to do too much too fast to feign superiority and letting their geopolitical ambitions take priority over sound economic management . <p> One ca n't help thinking that the underlying message here is that interest rates HAVE to be kept low in order to wring the last ounce of the debt monster that has been created in the last 20 odd years ( if not more ) as that is the only thing that has kept ' growth ' going . As such any and all other avenues ( other than actually setting a reasonable level for the price of debt ) have to be considered . <p> Incredible that it 's come to this - end stage capitalism begins to eat itself . <p> When your economy takes money created by bank lending and stuffs it into the pockets of rich people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest rates to keep the economy moving . Why ? Because if net lending rates fall behind the rate required to sustain jobs and consumption , your economy tanks and thousands of people lose their jobs ( see 2023 as a live example ) . We could all live quite happily without relying on credit money gushing into the economy if we kept the money moving ( ie stopped it being hoarded ) and only used cheap credit for productivity improvements that enabled us to work less hours for the same output . <p> The sectors with systemically significant prices fall into three groups : energy , basic production inputs other than energy , basic necessities , and commercial and financial infrastructure . Specifically , they are " Petroleum and coal products " , " Oil and gas extraction " , " Utilities " , " Chemical products " , " Farms " , " Food and beverage and tobacco products " , " Housing " , and " Wholesale trade " . <p> Would love to see an analysis of this sort , and the tools that could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The more I look at it , the more I believe we need to act and act swiftly on behalf of 1/3 of our population in rental accommodation . We are on a systemically significant precipice , for sure , as the recent interest rate rises are the last nail in the coffin for many small investors . <p> And what is the Government doing about managing this shock - naught . They 're like a possum in the headlights as there just is n't the paradigmatic thinking in government circles here that the author talks about .. <p> And what is the Government doing about managing this shock - naught .

Any evidence for that blanket assertion in successful countries . The vague reference point given is the wilful supply constraints enacted by US oil oligopoly during the pandemic artificial market to extract windfall profits . Not dissimilar to NZ power generators spilling hydro to increase the electricity spot price . <p> I well recall NZs price control experiment 40 odd years ago , including concurrent wage/salary fixing . The closest we ever came to communism ( under a National government ) . <p> Increasing warehousing ( =increased stock buffers beyond optimum demand/replenishment cycles ) wo n't work in a real business that needs to make a profit - &amp; it will come at significant additional costs including quality &amp; wastage .

Tahiti , Honolulu ... Monaco ... the south of France ... <p> A Price Stability Authority that took action to smooth out the fluctations in the price of fuel and fertiliser ( and maybe some high-use building materials ) would be ridiculously popular with businesses and would make a huge difference to production costs and local prices . An authority like this could be cost neutral . It 's a no brainer for a little country in pacific that is demonstrably a price taker . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people striving to consume more today , than they did yesterday . <p> A totally artificial , human construct , based on extraction of parts of a finite planet . And the high priests of this self-aggrandizing religion ( because it is a belief system , nothing more ) ? Economists . Who are looking increasingly bewildered , for obvious-to-physics reasons . <p> The reliance on endless debt enslavement with overshoot bailed out by inflation ( socialisation of losses ) is not the answer . Lift rates to where they should be . Let the speculative accept the risk they have taken and be eliniminate if needs be ( capitalism ) , and ensure a true cost of capital/debt remains there after . <p> 100% correct . The over-indebted and speculators knew that they were taking a gamble , and if they are going to be punished so be it . The true cost of capital/debt should at the very least be equal to the inflation rate . For example , a neutral OCR now should be at least at 6% . <p> I like the proposition in principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currently experiencing . This is causing real harm to people . On the other side there will be a hell of a lot of resistance from vested interests via their lobbyists to setting such a system up as it threatens profitability threatens the accepted economic mantra . <p> Inflation has to be tackled as it hurts the lower and middle earners more yesterday got a block of cheese which cost 16.90 was around 11 a year ago food price 's are rocketing up , people living in cars two or three families in one house crime is rampant this is only going to get worse unless inflation is pulled back wages never go up as much as inflation when it is at this level . <p> Exactly , and tackling inflation has a simple answer .. rapid increase of the OCR and mortgage rates . we all know this . the trouble is ( and the reason rates were so low for too long and caused inflation ) is that the powers that be are being pressured to keep rates low to benefit the wealthy and overleveraged . <p> Sooner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rise .. but very rapidly as hosue prices crash - then rents will also crash .. and inflation will cease . Which will help the poor and renters . <p> Its how the system should work - when properly managed . if RBNZ were serious about their one target ( inflation ) and had incorporated all housing costs into the inflation numbers years ago then none of this would even be an issue . <p> trying to change how we respond would just be a last ditch attempt to rescue asset prices instead of actually using the hammer properly and nailing inflation <p> I wonder how high the OCR can go before indirectly causing negative equity in bank 's balance sheets . One of the less important " ahem " rbnz mandates is financial stability . I 'm no fan price controlls by the way , becaue they just lead to shortages as far as I can tell . 
@@97844239 <p> So there is competition in NZ for banking ; but is our market really competitive when such profit is made ? Or is it a sign , in fact , of a healthy banking sector being rewarded for taking on risk ? <p> Philip Stevens , director of economic research at the Productivity Commission , has been delving into competition issues for years in New Zealand , including as manager and chief advisor of economic strategy for the Ministry of Business , Innovation and Employment and its forerunner , the Ministry of Economic Development . <p> Economist Stevens warns there is no simple measure for competition . This is why he is backing a Commerce Commission market study into the sector . <p> But what we can do now , he says , is look at our banking sector and draw some conclusions . <p> New Zealand banking has the big four , or what Stevens calls an oligopoly - a market concentrated in a few big players , or more technically , a market where the top five firms hold more than 60% of market share . <p> A monopoly is one firm dominating a market , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supermarket sector is duopoly , which is two firms dominating . <p> Why are the four Australian banks so big ? <p> Stevens says with 17 registered banks in New Zealand barriers to entry like regulation do n't seem to be an issue . There are plenty of banks here , operating . <p> The question then becomes , he says , why are the four Australian banks so big ? <p> Economies of scale , the efficiencies and cost savings from having a big business , and historical factors could explain some of their size , Stevens says . <p> Banks need large networks to run transactions , and they used to need networks of branches so their customers could make payments . <p> Those are lesser factors these days , Stevens says . So what could it be that keeps us with the big four ? <p> " It may well be that there 's a sort of path dependency , or hysteresis , or just the fact that you get locked in with a bank . You can easily choose a shop for one transaction , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not like that with banking . People do n't want to switch for each transaction , so there is a kind of lock in . " <p> Stevens says banking is a risky business . Bigger banks like NZ 's big four can diversify their risk , and they can lend to lots of different people or businesses with different risk profiles , spreading risk . <p> The Australian banks may be diversifying their own risk in Australia by operating in New Zealand too . <p> For example , if the Australian economy tanks and mineral prices are low , the Aussie banks have New Zealand operations where maybe the price of milk is still high , and would be able to shift money between the two countries so the bank does n't fail , Stevens says . <p> " That 's another reason they are likely to be big . " <p> How concentrated is the banking sector ? <p> The next question the economist says we need to think about is how concentrated our banking sector is to analyse how competitive it is . He says NZ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> One measure used , a concentration ratio , looks at how much of a market share is held by three players , or five players , or eight players . <p> The higher the percentage is , and the lower the number of players there are , the more concentrated an industry is . <p> A concentration ratio from 0% to 50% is considered low concentration , 50% to 80% concentration falls in the " medium " concentration ratio , high concentration is a concentration ratio from 80% to 100% - both the medium and high ratio indicate an oligopoly . <p> New Zealand banking of course has four big players dominating , not five or three , which is " interesting " , Stevens says . <p> Using World Bank data , Stevens says New Zealand 's banking concentration is about in the middle of the pack , with countries such as Finland and Portugal having a much higher concentration in banking . <p> " This shows the difficulty of just using one statistic ... so we 're not super concentrated . But we do have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thing that people have been highlighting recently . " ' <p> The recent KPMG annual financial services report found the New Zealand banking sector had a return on equity of 13.4% ? in 2022 , compared to 15% ? on the companies in the NZ stock exchange 's top 50 index , the NZX50 . <p> Westpac had a RoE for 2022 of 12.66% ? , while our biggest bank , ANZ , booked a RoE of 14.79% and ASB reported a healthy RoE of 15.16% ? while BNZ 's was 13.5% ? . <p> The picture across the Tasman looks different , with lower RoE . <p> ANZ reported an RoE of 10.4% ? compared to 14.79% ? in New Zealand , for example , while Westpac 's RoE gap saw it report RoE in Australia of 7.5% . <p> Competition could be a factor , as could risk , Stevens says . Higher risk needs higher returns . <p> Debt reliance <p> The juicy RoE enjoyed by our banks could also be as a result of our low productivity economy , and investment in housing as assets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a small economy , Stevens says . <p> " Which kind of has two important implications for me . One is , firms themselves have to rely more heavily on debt finance rather than equity . That locks them in with their bank , whereas if they sold shares , anyone can own a share , and there is a very different kind of relationship with that . Then we have this issue , what we call asymmetric information , which is that the bank knows a lot about the firm . It 's very hard for them to go to another bank , because they 're more risky for the other bank than they are to the current one , because the bank sees their money go in and out . " <p> On the other side of that equation , investors ca n't buy shares or do n't want to , so they invest in housing . <p> New Zealand has a highly leveraged housing market , high interest rates , high interest costs which makes them a riskier bet , Stevens says , and drives the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could also be a sign of a lack of competition , but they are also an incentive for competition . <p> " Effectively , there 's lots of people competing , and the winner gets to be a monopoly . " <p> He says it 's not unusual to have an oligopoly in banking , and competition in oligopolies often happen " in fits and starts " . <p> " You might have a long period of no competition and suddenly somebody moves you know , like the petrol company lowers its price ... and then everybody else follows really quickly afterwards . " <p> Of course , there is also consumer behaviour to consider . And Stevens thinks this is important . <p> " The really key thing is consumers being able to compare and then be able to switch costlessly between things . That 's the engine room of competition . " <p> We are n't switching our banks much at all . Data from Consumer NZ 's banking survey shows about 4% of people switched banks across a year in its latest data . <p> Switching ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says based on its research , people see switching as difficult . <p> " And if you think about it , or me personally contemplating if I was to switch my bank , the level of unwinding that needs to happen with automatic payments and debits and various other things . It is quite an undertaking to think about that . I think that makes customers sticky . Rather than switching people will keep a call bank account or pick up services from other banks instead . " <p> He says not switching has a detrimental impact on the service we 're provided because banks can just " sit there kind of fat , dumb and happy and know that they 've got an apathetic , stable customer base " . <p> " That does n't necessarily mean they have to scrap for new clients . They 've got a stable income that 's coming in from those clients . And I 'm talking here about personal banking . I think we see a lot more competition in the mortgage market . People do tend to come off their mortgage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is and potentially switch . This is what makes the prospect of a market study really interesting , and that there could be multiple markets within the banking sector that need to be carved out and examined . " <p> Open banking , or the ability to easily shift between banks , is well and truly back on the radar . <p> In November 2022 the-then Commerce Minister David Clark announced open banking would be introduced within two years . <p> The banking sector will be the first to implement a consumer data right framework , meaning banks must share customer information if they request it . <p> Clark said in November that open banking allows customers to shop around for better deals . <p> " That means banks will also have to work harder to retain their customers , leading to savings for consumers . " <p> He has pointed out open banking is required for the Aussie parent companies of NZ 's big banks , and is in use in the United Kingdom . <p> Banks ' not afraid ' <p> Chief executive of the New Zealand Banking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of open banking , but it is complex due to the sensitivity of people 's banking data . <p> " If you think about what your banking data contains , that tells an awful lot about you and your life . And so if you 're opening that up to third parties , you want to be really solid in the framework and security and robustness of that security , before you start to pass on that data and customers , I think , also need to understand the significance of that . " <p> You can , of course , already switch bank . Most bank sites have a how to switch page , and it has long been boasted that New Zealanders can change bank in five working days just by filling out a form . <p> The reality can be more complex than filling out a web form . Take the changes to the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act as an example , which saw consumers ' spending put under the microscope for lending and outraged wannabe borrowers declined loans for buying takeaways or streaming services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to divulge every dollar you fritter , or have your financial life forensically pulled apart to shop around for a new mortgage or loan , that becomes a barrier to changing bank . <p> The government has since " clarified " the rules and tweaked the legislation , but it shows a few useful things . Regulation that is intended to protect consumers can have unintended negative consequences , throw up barriers for competition and push consumers into staying sticky with their existing bank . <p> " If you want a new mortgage , banks do want to see that history of behaviour and activity . But that 's a good example of where open banking in play will make that analysis by a competitor bank a whole lot easier . Because the data exchange will be a whole lot simpler than filling out a whole lot of paper forms or going through a painful process , " Beaumont says . <p> Regulation and the cost of it is a key issue for the sector , the bank lobby group boss says . He says that 's probably the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sheer impost of regulatory requirements and reform , and the workload that that puts on their infrastructure . It 's an enormous challenge . And the quid pro quo of those regulatory obligations is that the thing that drops off the to-do list is customer-centric innovations . Because when you think about the technology system of a bank , when you 've got the hood up , if you like , on the IT systems , there 's only so much at one time that you can safely do without sort of putting too much strain on those technology systems . " <p> Beaumont says the industry is waiting to see what the open banking legislation looks like because they wo n't want to have to make changes twice . <p> As for the sector 's competitiveness , much like Stevens , Beaumont highlights how many banks are operating here as a sign there 's plenty of competition . <p> " There 's no bars on the door to halt new entrants " , he says . " New Zealand has 17 registered retail banks . That 's an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they want to bank . " <p> Beaumont says there 's nothing restricting anybody from changing banks , other than probably the perception of it being harder than it actually is in reality . <p> " And so , my message is simple , but actually , you should shop around you should make sure that you 're getting the best deal for you . And then go and go and hunt that out and find it because there 's nothing to stop you from switching banks . " <p> He says it still requires consumers to be savvy about understanding what is available in the market , and some customers can get access to better deals than others which are n't advertised . <p> " If that 's the case , then how does an individual navigate the mortgage market or the savings market or some other markets without that information ? " <p> Renney says Kiwibank 's struggles to make significant inroads into the big four 's dominance shows competing is n't easy and any bank wanting to take on the big four needs deep , deep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zealand have done consistently well , and questions why they earn so much compared with their parents across the Tasman . <p> Renney does n't think New Zealanders are particularly enamoured with the big four , they are seen as " an amorphous blob " and you land with a bank because that 's where you got a mortgage . <p> " The New Zealand market is essentially in equilibrium with the banks , offering very similar rates to each other on various things because we do n't move around enormously and because that market equilibrium benefits those larger providers . " <p> Wanted : A market study <p> Like Stevens , Renney wants to see a market study - as soon as possible - by the Commerce Commission into banking . <p> Duffy agrees , and says the banks ' profits mean they warrant a market study which would dig into how competitive the sector is . <p> " The really important thing that comes from an independent agency like the Commerce Commission doing a study is they 've actually got no skin in the game here . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they to do an impartial assessment in the same way as a court of law . " <p> He says the banking industry is exactly where the supermarket sector was before its market study . There is a sense things are n't quite working . <p> " A market study is an impartial evidential baseline of what 's going on in a market . " <p> Such a study would help to answer the question posed at the outset - is New Zealand 's banking industry competitive ? Stevens says we just do n't know unless we really look , and we ca n't rely on any one measure to tell the full story . <p> Remember we welcome robust , respectful and insightful debate . We do n't welcome abusive or defamatory comments and will de-register those repeatedly making such comments . Our current comment policy is here . <p> The issue is price dictates a ceiling on how much extra value is worth marketing . <p> So any extra value you either have to go digging for yourself ( or use a 3rd party , which you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high roller and pay over the odds for slightly better **26;1384;TOOLONG <p> Personal Banking is a matter of " Do n't poke it , and it wo n't bite you ! " <p> I poked it a few years back , when I did n't really have to and should have left well enough alone , and that long-standing monthly Visa capacity of $57,000 , " Well , that would n't be issued today , Sir . Because let 's face it , I ca n't tick the box that says you have a formal job . So we 'll have to drop it down " and after decades of no fuss regularity , they did . <p> For example , people were so happy to bash property investors because their huge capital gains , now that everyone suffers losses , does it mean property investors should come back and charge IRD for their losses now ? <p> " Security and safety should be one and only most important thing people should focusing on . " <p> Did n't the worldwide banking system almost collapse not that long ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Too big to fail ? Not NZ ones specifically , but that does n't mean they would have remained standing . <p> In my view technology is the high bar for entry by new players , in the banking sector . Besides the size of capital funding required to get to size to challenge the Big Four . Kiwibank has failed miserably . TSB is happy to be in a Niche . Rest of the new players do n't really matter . <p> Now that Kiwibank is owned by the Government , the FM can easily bring it up to speed , with good funding . Will he ? They do n't seem to have a plan for Kiwibank . They had to take it because two big holders wanted out <p> There should be a Cabinet level move to work Kiwibank to a good shape quickly . Else , we will keep exporting our hard earned money as bank profits overseas . <p> I cant believe someone wrote an article about why people bank with the Big 4 and did nt actually mention the number one reason why people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurance , so putting your money into anything but the financially strongest banks is simply not sensible . And whether or not its actually true , the perception is that as the NZ Big 4 are backed by the Australian Big 4 , the chances of them going belly up like South Canterbury Finance and the BNZ is small(er) . Opening a deposit account is the first step in a banking relationship , everything follows from that . <p> Well its not strategically important like Air NZ is , so probably . Even Marsden Point was allowed to go belly up despite being a strategic asset , and now we are all suffering from that decision . Do you trust the Govt to make smart decisions ? No I do not . <p> Yes if we had deposit insurance now would you take a 6% TD at a B rated bank or a 5.3% TD at an A rated bank ? This has happened in the last month in NZ , if the deposit guarantee scheme was in place I would have taken the 6% , but then again if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offering the 6% ..... <p> Size is a big advantage right now when it comes to IT systems , cyber-security , and compliance costs . TSB and KB are struggling with this right now and are both at the cross-roads . I doubt a TSB can bridge the gap now . We all love our great internet banking and app the the big 4 ( ANZ are the standout here ) , the banking apps at some of the small banks are very antiquated . <p> I would rather have good profitable banks than a struggling one - then I would be very worried . You get what you pay for . <p> Ive just borrowed a larger sum for a business project and its not easy to get - but neither should it be - my parents savings are in that bank and I want them protected by a bank that checks who it relends to and they can repay it and they have plenty of slack to cover unexpected events . <p> If they went bust we would then have cries of they were to poorly capitalised and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit strange that in the middle of a global banking crisis , our Govt is worried that our banks make too much money . Personally , I 'd rather they raked in the profits and kept my money safe , then they lower margins or fork over more tax to the Govt and are then forced to sell assets at a loss to cover their liquidity requirements , which puts my money at risk . But then , we have a Finance Minister with a degree in Art . <p> I find it criminal and prehistoric , with the level of technological advancement in the last 30years , how if you transfer money after 5pm to a different bank or on weekends that the money does n't go through until the next business day . This allows banks the extra time to play with that money in order to profit . Banking should be instant , readily available ( banking online and apps have remedied this ) and easy to change banks , hence driving more competition to keep business and reducing such excessive profits . It 's easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are too high , it 's a mission to go through changing banks due to all the ant money laundering regulations now . Having seen my wife go through it recently , she outright refused to answer half of the banks questions due to how personal they were , and they were fine with this , showing they are simply getting more information than is necessary for lord knows what purpose . <p> There is no point in doing a market study which will be just another case of stating the bleeding obvious without proposing any workable solutions . Rebecca 's article shows quite clearly there is plenty of competition , but you can not make people change banks . <p> The supermarket study was a complete waste of time - the Commerce Commission let the horse bolt over 20 years ago when it let Woolworths Australia take over Progressive Enterprises , thereby reducing three chains to two . So there is n't much point in expecting it to come up with a magic answer , when it was n't prepared to protect consumers then .

" <p> In 1897 , Venice began taking the measure of its enemy , establishing a reference mark for high water at the Punta della Salute entrance of the Grand Canal . In the first two decades of the 20th century , Venice had high tides above 110 centimetres only six times . <p> But the average sea level in Venice has risen nearly 30 centimetres since 1900 .

The tectonic plates under the city are naturally settling , a process accelerated in the 20th century by the pumping of groundwater for use in the industrial port of neighbouring Marghera . <p> From 1950 to 1970 , Venice sank nearly 12cm .

Photo / Laetitia Vancon , The New York Times <p> In 1984 , the government subcontracted the building of MOSE to a consortium of major Italian companies and estimated that the walls would be put in place by 1995 . It was not until 2003 that Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi , a proponent of big public works , laid the first stone . The estimate then was that the project would be finished by 2011 . <p> But in November 2010 , a panel of experts was still debating which metal should be used on the hinges to lock the submerged walls into the seabed . <p> In the Palace of the 10 Wise Men at the foot of the Rialto Bridge , officials met in the headquarters of the Magistrate of the Waters , an ancient body overseeing Venice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going back centuries , some experts rebelled against the political pressure they felt to give approval on technical questions . <p> " I do n't want to be an accomplice , " Lorenzo Fellin , an electrical engineer on one key panel , recalled saying as he stormed out of a meeting to protest what he considered bullying from the magistrate . Fellin explained that he had the clear impression that " the idea was that since they had already spent so much public money , the project needed to be completed , whether it worked or not . " <p> MOSE became a constant source of controversy and doubt .

" Because , unfortunately , he was arrested . " <p> Afterward , from 2014 to 2018 , public financing dried up as the state , loath to enable more graft , examined expenditures with extreme caution . Many businesses involved in the scandal folded . <p> The project was nearly an orphan -- scorned even by the engineer who designed it and was known as the father of MOSE , Alberto Scotti . " I 've rejected my paternity , " he said over maintenance delays . <h> Disaster foretold <p> On the night of November 12 , 2019 , a sharp drop in temperature caused what Papa , the head forecaster , described as a never-before-seen " anomalous tropical cyclone .

" <p> Days later , the water came again , reaching more than 1.5 metres , itself one of the worst levels in decades . <p> The border between the canals and the sidewalks dissolved . The lagoon spilled into the city . Wooden pikes floated up next to store windows . Long sirens whined . Schools were closed and restaurants shuttered .

He and others tried to hold it back with sacks . But the water was too strong and started shooting through the bricks . <p> This was it , the big one that MOSE had been designed to stop . Engineers at the time said it was ready . But it stood down . <p> The failure to stop the great floods brought political pressure , international scrutiny and uncomfortable introspection to Venice and all of Italy .

With relatively little fanfare , the walls went up as Italy 's attention was absorbed not in beating back the sea but in breaking the wave of the coronavirus contagion . <p> They worked . Engineers popped prosecco . <p> Since then , Venice has been protected from high-water events , but the parts of the city that flood at lower levels remain precariously exposed . <p> To avoid raising the sea walls too often , the lowest parts of Venice , including Alvise Papa 's basement , remain vulnerable to floods . Photo / Laetitia Vancon , The New York Times <p> The experts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to be raised an average of five times a year to stop tides of about 1.1 metres . Since MOSE began functioning about two years ago , the walls have been raised 49 times . <p> On Monday , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , an authoritative body of experts convened by the United Nations , said the Earth was likely to cross a critical threshold for global warming within the next decade . According to their best estimate , the sea level in Venice could rise by nearly 76cm by the end of the century , if emissions are high . <p> At that rate , experts say the walls would need to be up more often than they were down . Combine that with the increasingly common violent winds and record rainfalls that push more water into the lagoon , and the walls may need to be raised nearly constantly , turning the decision on its head . <p> " You would be talking about opening the lagoon -- not closing the lagoon , " said Georg Umgiesser , a scientist based in Venice at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luigi D'Alpaos , a professor emeritus of hydraulics at the University of Padova and a staunch critic of the project , said in his office decorated with maps of the lagoon that the constantly raised walls would turn the lagoon into " the swamp of Venice . " <p> Fishermen and other shipping interests have already expressed concern about the walls , but officials supportive of MOSE point out that navigable locks are in the works for boats to pass when the barriers are up . <p> Defenders of the sea walls expressed frustration with doomsday predictions about their effect in a century 's time , especially since MOSE has now left Venice better defended than many other coastal cities . <p> " In 50 years , in 100 years , what do we know what the lagoon will be like ?

For most of the past two decades , China has been the single largest engine of global growth . Despite simmering tensions with the United States and growing disagreements with Europe , China remains highly interdependent with both those economies at an uneasy time .

Unlike the West , China refrained from sending pandemic checks and coupons to households . So people have limited ability to bid up prices for goods . Consumer prices were only 0.7 per cent higher in March compared with last year , and the prices producers charge their customers for industrial goods fell . <p> " Inadequate domestic demand remains prominent , and the foundation for economic recovery is not solid yet , " said Fu Linghui , an official at the statistics bureau . <p> The incomes of millions of Chinese were severely depressed during the pandemic , and remain weak .

( AWS ) , an Amazon.com , Inc. company ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) , today announced three new capabilities for Amazon GuardDuty , AWS 's threat detection service , that further strengthen customer security through expanded coverage and continuous enhancements in machine learning , anomaly detection , and integrated threat intelligence . GuardDuty is part of a broad set of AWS security services that help customers identify potential security risks , so they can respond quickly , freeing security teams to focus on tasks with the highest value . The three new capabilities expand GuardDuty protection to container runtime behavior , as well as database and serverless environments . EKS Runtime Monitoring deepens threat detection inside customers ' containerized workloads . GuardDuty RDS Protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GuardDuty Lambda Protection helps customers detect threats to their serverless applications . To get started with Amazon GuardDuty , visit aws.amazon.com/guardduty . <p> The ability to gather , synthesize , and alert on security-relevant events is fundamental to any organization 's risk management program . The evolving cybersecurity landscape and multitude of security tools from different vendors , combined with a shortage of IT security professionals , make it challenging for customers to integrate and scale security detection and response across their environments . Many security teams today have to build or integrate multiple tools to detect anomalies , such as web server vulnerabilities , compromised instances used to serve malware or mine cryptocurrency , or compromised access credentials . Integration challenges can lead to inefficiencies , data inconsistencies , and increased costs . In addition , the workplace and threat landscape continue to evolve , requiring chief information security officers ( CISOs ) to continually raise the bar on enterprise security to account for cloud adoption , remote working , and third-party infrastructure integration . Demand for technologies and services such as cloud threat detection , security analytics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising to tackle new vulnerabilities , misconfigurations , and other IT risks emerging from this digital transformation . <p> GuardDuty helps protect customers from the latest threats through ongoing innovation in machine learning , anomaly detection , and integrated threat intelligence continuously derived from the broad visibility AWS has across the global threat landscape . With a few clicks in the AWS Management Console , customers can activate GuardDuty across multiple accounts in multiple AWS Regions on highly trusted and secure-by-design AWS Cloud infrastructure and mitigate threats early by initiating automated responses . Since its launch in 2017 , GuardDuty has added more than 100 new threat detection capabilities , including the ability to detect credential exfiltration and compromise even when highly evasive techniques are used . GuardDuty uses machine learning detections trained to identify highly suspicious data access and any potential Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud ( Amazon EC2 ) compromise , and uses integrated threat intelligence to detect malware and malicious container , database , and serverless access . GuardDuty comes with pre-integrated and continuously updated threat intelligence feeds from AWS and industry-leading , third-party providers such as CrowdStrike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers unique coverage against the latest global threat landscape , including emerging Linux-based malware , evolving credential exfiltration techniques , and new malicious domains identified through machine learning -- based reputation models . <p> The three new capabilities added to GuardDuty build on the hundreds of features and enhancements available since its launch and expand security coverage to other AWS workloads and core deployment use cases . The capabilities can all be easily enabled organization-wide with a few steps and no other requirements or prerequisites , resulting in actionable , contextual , and timely security findings with resource-specific details to help quickly investigate and respond . The new capabilities include : <p> New container runtime protection for Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service ( Amazon EKS ) : GuardDuty EKS Runtime Monitoring introduces a fully managed , lightweight security agent that profiles and monitors on-host operating system -- level behavior such as file access , process execution , and network connections . In tight collaboration with Amazon EKS , the agent performs without requiring customers to deploy , maintain , or update it . This allows GuardDuty to add security coverage comparable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It deepens GuardDuty protection for Amazon EKS deployments and decreases the operational overhead and complexity often required to achieve this level of coverage , especially in highly dynamic , containerized compute environments . GuardDuty now makes it easier to achieve runtime coverage across all Amazon EKS workloads in an account or organization . Account and data compromise can often start with a single compromised endpoint or container that then escalates to credential compromise and can spread to the broader AWS environment and data stored in it . With GuardDuty 's visibility across runtime events , Kubernetes audit logs , and broader AWS control plane and networking logs , customers can identify steps in an attack and are signaled early to contain potential security threats before the threat escalates to broader business-impacting breaches . This capability builds on the initial integration of GuardDuty EKS Protection , which monitors control plane activity by analyzing Kubernetes audit logs from existing and new Amazon EKS clusters in customers ' accounts . <p> Extended coverage for data stored in Amazon Aurora : GuardDuty RDS Protection identifies potential threats to data stored in Aurora databases without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Protection profiles and monitors access activity to existing and new databases in customer accounts , and using integrated threat intelligence and a machine learning model that is trained with highly contextual RDS login activity , it can detect suspicious login activity to Aurora databases . <p> " Tens of thousands of organizations across virtually every industry and geography use Amazon GuardDuty , including more than 90% of our 2,000 largest customers , helping to protect more than half a billion EC2 instances and millions of S3 buckets , " said Jon Ramsey , vice president for Security Services at AWS . " GuardDuty 's new capabilities build on this powerful foundation to expand security detection and monitoring even further , to where customers tell us they need it most : containers ' runtime monitoring , databases , and serverless applications .

@@98428231 <h> Join Reseller News <h> Schools look to ban ChatGPT , students use it anyway <p> ChatGPT and other generative AI technologies are already being used by students to write essays and answer questions posed by teachers and professors , and academia must learn to incorporate and not ban these new tools , experts say . <p> School districts throughout the US and abroad have banned chatbot use on their networks and devices over fears students will use generative AI tech to hand in unauthentic and potentially plagiarised work . <p> Universities and their professors are also wringing their hands about how to deal with artificial intelligence such as ChatGPT that students can use to write papers or generate exam answers . <p> " They 're still in shock to an extent , " said Tony Sheehan , a vice president and higher education analyst at Gartner . " The rapid consumer adoption of this product has taken everyone by surprise , and of course that includes the education sector because it 's about creative content generation -- whether that 's an essay , or code , or pictures , whatever . " <p> Soon after ChatGPT was launched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York City Public Schools , moved to ban its use by students . The second largest school district in the US , Los Angeles Unified , soon followed suit and blocked access from school networks to the website of OpenAI , the company that created ChatGPT . Other school districts have done the same , including Baltimore , MD , Oakland Unifiedin California , andSeattle Public Schools . <p> " While the tool may be able to provide quick and easy answers to questions , it does not build critical-thinking and problem-solving skills , which are essential for academic and lifelong success , " said Jenna Lyle , a spokeswoman for the New York City Department of Education , in a statement to The Washington Post . <p> " ChatGPT really falls into the educational area quite strongly , " Sheehan said . " I think educational institutions for the last few months have been both exploring and adopting a position on this . And in some cases , particularly from individual faculty , that is an urge to ban it . <p> " But at the institutional level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change in the sector and something that 's not going away completely anytime soon , " he added . <p> One obvious problem : how do you stop students from using a chatbot that can easily be downloaded to a laptop or smartphone ? <p> There are anti-plagiarism tools from companies such as Grammarly and EasyBib that can compare student work to billions of web pages as well as academic databases and check for duplication . The anti-plagiarism tools can also highlight passages that require citations and give students the resources to properly credit sources . <p> However , the dilemma remains that if students end up plagiarising work , they can still use online tools to reword essays or other documents . And as generative AI technology advances in sophistication , the content it creates will become less detectable as unoriginal , Sheehan said . <p> " Of course , the other thing students will do is use chatbot generated content as a first draft , " Sheehan said . " I just need some idea , give me some . Great ! Now , I 'll just go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research and references to it and it becomes almost impossible to detect that . Many institutions are saying , maybe this is something we should encourage students to do . " <h> Students might shun schools that ban ChatGPT <p> What the various educational institutions decide could affect what students do . <p> In January , Stanford University 's school paper -- The Stanford Daily -- published the results of " an informal poll " that indicated 17% of 4,497 respondents had used ChatGPT on their final exams . <p> Most ( 59.2% ) used the chatbot for brainstorming , outlining and forming ideas , according to the poll . Another 29.1% used it to answer multiple choice questions . And while 7.3% submitted written material from ChatGPT with edits , 5.5% said they submitted written material from ChatGPT unedited . <p> At the time of the survey , the school 's policies forbade students from using the AI tools . <p> The Stanford Daily 's survey results were echoed by another survey performed this week by higher education search service College Rover . In that survey , more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coursework and they 're using it multiple times per week . <p> Additionally : <p> 36% of students indicated their professors have threatened to fail students caught using AI technologies for coursework . <p> 29% of students say their university has issued guidance regarding ChatGPT and other AI tools . <p> Nearly 6 in 10 students think universities should not ban ChatGPT and other similar AI technologies . <p> Stanford 's Board on Judicial Affairs ( BJA ) has been monitoring ChatGPT and other AI tools and more recently published policy guidance for their use in coursework , a university spokesperson said in an email reply to Computerworld . <p> " Absent a clear statement from a course instructor , use of or consultation with generative AI shall be treated analogously to assistance from another person , " the university policy states . <p> A Stanford committee has also published preliminary proposals and recommendations that include requiring students to ask professors about the use of ChatGPT , and to not use the AI technology on an exam " when it is n't expressly allowed ... " <p> " Concerns about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not revisit its current policies and plan accordingly , " the university 's proposal states . " The dramatic emergence of ChatGPT and its sequel GPT-4 since last November has expanded the scope of these issues considerably ( e.g. , humanties coursework is now impacted by technology in ways that were inconceivable before last November ) . " <p> University students have strong feelings about the usefulness of generative AI technologies , and whether or not a school allows their use appears to shape their decision to attend there . In a survey released last week by College Rover , nearly four in 10 students indicated they 're not interested in attending a college or university that bans chatbots such as ChatGPT . <p> The survey showed 39% of respondents would shun a school that banned generative AI tech and AI in general . <p> But it was the ChatGPT question that raised concerns about originality and plagiarism by generative AI . <p> The survey of 372 students who 've sought college admission this fall showed men ( 62% ) are slightly more likely than women ( 58% ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tools . <p> A College Rover spokesperson said while there have already been many bans in K-12 level schools , " institutions of higher education in the US have been a bit hesitant to ban the tools just yet " -- instead , colleges and universities are updating their academic integrity and plagiarism policies to account for the use of AI tools . <p> " Allowing students to leverage tools like ChatGPT is not much different than giving them an open-book test . In order to pass , students still have to understand the material and how to utilise their resources , whether that be a textbook or a chatbot , in the most effective way , " said Bill Townsend , founder and CEO of College Rover . <p> Some educators liken chatbot shutdowns to banning calculators : chatbots are nothing more than a tool to be used to research and develop ideas . <h> The cat 's out of the bag <p> Dr. Boris Steipe , a professor emeritus at the University of Toronto 's Department of Biochemistry , makes no bones about allowing his students to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sets no limits on how they use generative AI . <p> " Students will be assessed on the quality of their work . The work has to be well thought through , it has to be validated , and correct , " he said . " That said , I have always used oral exams in my courses , and that will remain . The human aspect of learning is one of the few invariants . But they might ask their favorite AI to help . " <p> Steipe 's students are not required to show their creative process , but will get credit for it if they do , as well as for sharing their experiences in completing their work . <p> Far from being an adversary to the learning process , Steipe called the arrival of ChatGPT an " historical moment , " and he said educators should prepare students to work with AI resources instead of attempting to shut them down . <p> " The world is changing and if we do n't prepare our students to work with AI resources , we are not preparing them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making our courses AI-proof -- assigning hand-written papers or such -- we are missing the point of education , " Steipe said . <p> " We need to teach our students how to have the AI think with them , not for them . This is the most important goal : if we do n't achieve that , the AI will become their competitor , " he added . <p> Steipe first tried ChatGPT soon after its launch last year ; it was then he realised it was better at submitting assignments than most of his students . AI was changing " everything : teaching , learning and assessment . " <p> The professor then created Sentient Syllabus Project , an initiative by academics for academics to navigate the uncharted waters of the AI era . The project includes a weekly newsletter discussing various challenges posed by the technologies . <p> Currently , Steipe is redesigning a computational biology course from the ground up based on the abilities of artificial intelligence to assist students in their research and work . For example , he sees it as a way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but who can now become developers using the power of AI and chatbots like ChatGPT . ChatGPT is able to take prompts or suggestions from users and generate software code . <p> " Having personalised tutoring , self-assessed progress , adapting assignments to their learning styles , focusing on weaknesses -- we have known for a long time these things would help learning , but we could never do that in practice because it did not scale , " Steipe said . <p> While there may be no limits on how students use technology to aid their work , plagiarism , Steipe said , is another matter . " Students still ca n't pass off someone else 's work as their own , and the AI is not a quotable source , " he said . " This means they have to find the actual sources of ideas , and provide links to prove the source exists . But they had to do that anyway in the past . " <p> A spokesperson for ChatGPT-creator OpenAI said the company sees ChatGPT as a tool to assist with learning and education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of generative AI by students . <p> " We 're encouraged by the ways educators have been ideating on how tools like ChatGPT can be useful , " the spokesperson said . " We believe that educational policy experts should decide what works best for their districts and schools when it comes to the use of new technology . We are engaging with educators across the country to inform them of ChatGPT 's capabilities and our ongoing work to improve it . " <p> Will Douglas Heaven , the senior editor for AI at MIT 's Technology Review , recently wrote in a blog that after speaking with educators , some are beginning to accept that rather than " a dream machine for cheaters , many teachers now believe , ChatGPT could actually help make education better . " <p> For example , chatbots can be used as learning aids to make lessons more interactive , teach students media literacy , generate personalised lesson plans , save teachers time on administrative tasks , for example . <p> Companies , such as Duolingo and Quizlet , which make educational flashcards for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's chatbot into their apps , Heaven noted . <p> Gartner 's Sheehan said schools are considering using chatbots as part of the student assessment process and knowledge-development process and to encourage students to consider the implications of AI technology in the future . <p> " Over the past few months , we 've seen a lot more schools at institutional level saying ' We want to explore the implications of this , ' " Sheehan said . " How do we encourage students to use this , declare they 're using it , and use it almost as a study buddy , and then reflect on the experience and the quality of output and then report on that .

@@98428236 <p> Security researchers sounded the alert about a vulnerability in an UDP-based network service called the Service Location Protocol ( SLP ) that can be abused to amplify DDoS attacks . <p> Tens of thousands of systems and devices have this service exposed to the internet . Attackers could use them to generate massive attacks , and cleaning them up will likely take a very long time . <p> Researchers from security firms Bitsight and Curesec found a vulnerability that allows attackers to exploit SLP endpoints in a specific way that will generate big responses and then reflect those responses toward victims . <h> How DDoS reflection attacks and DDoS amplification work <p> DDoS reflection is an attack technique that relies on sending traffic to a server and having it send its response to a different IP address . This type of attack usually works with communication protocols that are built on top of User Datagram Protocol ( UDP ) , which along with Transmission Control Protocol ( TCP ) is one of the core protocols for transmitting data over the internet . <p> Unlike TCP , however , UDP was built for speed and does n't have additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source address spoofing . This means an attacker can send a UDP packet to a server but put a different source IP address in the packet instead of their own . This will cause the server to send their response to whatever source IP address was set . <p> In addition to the reflection effect , which hides the real originator of the traffic , with certain UDP-based protocols the resulting traffic can also be amplified meaning the generated response is much larger than the original request . This is known as DDoS amplification and is very useful for attackers because it allows them to generate more unsolicited traffic toward a target than they could if they send packets directly to it from the machines under their control . <p> DDoS amplification works with a variety of protocols including DNS ( Domain Name System ) , mDNS ( multicast DNS ) , NTP ( Network Time Protocol ) , SSDP ( Simple Service Discovery Protocol ) , SNMP ( Simple Network Management Protocol ) and others because they all use UDP for transmission . Servers exposed to the internet that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be abused for DDoS amplification and they historically have been used to generate some of the largest DDoS attacks to date . <h> The SLP vulnerability <p> The Service Location Protocol ( SLP ) is a legacy protocol that dates back to 1997 and was meant to be used on local networks for automated service discovery and dynamic configuration between applications . The SLP daemon on a system will maintain a directory of available services such as printers , file servers , and other network resources . It will listen to requests on UDP port 427 . <p> Even though SLP was not meant to be exposed outside local networks , researchers from Bitsight and Curesec identified over 54,000 devices that accept SLP connections on the internet .

@@98428237 <p> US Federal Communications Commission Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel believes that the time to start planning for 6G is now , and has outlined several steps that the government agency plans to take in preparation for the new wireless standard . <p> While there 's no general agreement on what technical innovations will be incorporated into 6G , it 's become clear that the goals of the technology are ambitious . Broadcast virtual or augmented reality , high-quality telehealth and more are expected by wireless experts . <p> That , however , will require a great deal of spectrum , and Rosenworcel -- speaking at the National Science Foundation last week -- said that the FCC is working to identify suitable frequencies for the new standard . <p> " We have already identified the 7-16GHz band as prime mid-band airwaves for the 6G era , " she said . " That is why we have started an inquiry into making 550MHz of spectrum in the 12.7-13.25GHz band available for new commercial mobile use . " <p> Currently , the airwaves between 7GHz and 16GHz are used for a wide array of different purposes , including fixed wireless links , aeronautical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to FCC records . But the most common usage in those bands includes several services related to satellites . <p> Hence , Rosenworcel 's announcement that the FCC has already begun a rulemaking designed to explore the possibilities of a unified satellite/terrestrial standards framework is unsurprising . <h> Spectrum requirements for 6G <p> The spectrum needs for 6G are likely to be orders of magnitude higher than those for 5G , according to Gartner senior director analyst Susan Welsh de Grimaldo . She said that even a subset of envisioned 6G capabilities could demand up to 3GHz of wide area spectrum , per a recent whitepaper from Ericsson . <p> " With anticipated timing of first commercial 6G deployments in 2030 , there is already an urgent need for the US to identify and plan for allocation of substantial amounts of new spectrum for both wide area and local area use for 6G , " she said . " Early alignment on spectrum is important to foster development and innovation and to be ready for commercial launch . " <p> There are aspects to the FCC 's public approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grimaldo . For one thing , early 5G efforts focused too heavily on the millimeter-wave spectrum -- an especially high frequency that offers wide channels and excellent potential throughput , but makes it difficult to provide wide area coverage due to limited propagation range . It has seen limited use in 5G deplotyments . <p> " With 6G , the FCC and NTIA seem to be addressing the learnings from the 5G spectrum challenges -- that is , to identify early on mid-band spectrum that will provide enough capacity and coverage and hopefully align more closely with spectrum bands for 6G in other countries , " Welsh de Grimaldo said . <p> Rosenworcel , in her remarks , also urged Congress to restore the FCC 's spectrum auctioning authority , which lapsed on March 9 . Restoring that authority would clear the way for more auctions , which , she said , have proved both highly remunerative for the government and highly efficient in allocating spectrum for commercial use . <h> Microsites <h> Featured <h> Slideshows <h> Channel gathers for Nextgen New Zealand 's Summer Party <p> ?

@@98493239 <h> Martin Whetton on how overseas investors view New Zealand government debt <p> New Zealand 's $33.8 billion record current account deficit was a shock to overseas investors in NZ government bonds , but is ultimately probably not something people will lose a lot of sleep over , says Sydney-based interest rate strategist Martin Whetton . <p> Statistics NZ last month reported the annual current account deficit reached $33.8 billion last year , equivalent to 8.9% of gross domestic product , the worst ratio since measurement began in 1988 . <p> In response credit rating agency S&amp;P Global Ratings told Bloomberg the deficit was ; " catching our attention , the persistently weak and worsening current account position of the New Zealand sovereign , particularly given that it has been quite weak the last year or two and our forecasts are for it to narrow . " This led to fears of a potential downgrade to NZ 's S&amp;P sovereign credit rating . <p> In terms of overseas investors who buy NZ 's government bonds , Whetton says the current account deficit is something they 'll look at . <p> " And obviously when that number came out recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because there was the immediate response from S&amp;P that suggested that the rating could be under threat as a result , " Whetton said in the latest episode of interest.co.nz 's Of Interest podcast . <p> " A decision on that can take some time , And I think if we just cool down for a moment and say ' New Zealand is in a very solid position , it has got a strong economy , and it does have very low debt-to-GDP at the government level , ' then it 's not something that people will lose a lot of sleep over . " <p> " There are investors who simply have hard mandates around credit rating , but when you 're starting at the top of the tree in ratings , very few people would not be able to buy New Zealand government debt so that 's not an issue if there was a downgrade , " said Whetton . <p> In the podcast Whetton also talks about the attraction to overseas investors of NZ government bonds , the NZ yield premium over other similarly rated bonds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , why he thinks NZ government debt is at a sustainable level , and finally how countries get into trouble with their sovereign debt . <p> " Typically it 's borrow in a foreign currency . The benefit of countries like Australia , New Zealand , the UK , Japan , Italy , is we borrow in our own currency . So we pay it back in our own currency and you can always print more of that currency . Now the purists would recoil at that comment and I understand why because it can be inflationary . But if you need to solve it that way you can , " Whetton said . <p> " You also , as we in Australia and New Zealand have found in the last couple of years , can get your central bank to buy government debt . I would not say that is the way you do things . Having a fiscal programme that is credible over the medium to long-term is probably your best starting point .

What differentiates the governments spending from bank credit is the currency reserves which the government issues to the banks when it makes payments and every dollar that the government spends created a new dollar of reserves while taxation deletes both the bank deposit and the reserves again . <p> The government can also choose to reduce these reserves again by issuing bonds and so bonds are just a different form of reserves and do n't finance its spending . Just as QE swapped the bonds back into reserves and was n't money printing as it is often referred to .

And so he does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was a position occupied by an entirely different Chris until very recently . <p> Christopher Luxon took over leadership of the National Party in late 2021 and , as the NZ public tired of pandemic restrictions and daily crisis briefings , quickly took the lead as the ' not-Jacinda ' candidate . <p> The feeling at that time was that the National Party only had to look competent and non-controversial , and anti-Labour sentiment would hand them the election . <p> But then Ardern resigned , and suddenly there was a new ' not-Jacinda ' candidate to contend with : Chris Hipkins . <p> Safest set of hands <p> Although he was virtually hand picked as her successor , Hipkins has not been afraid to break with the former leader and dramatically reinvent the sixth Labour government . <p> He has been careful not to directly criticize Ardern , who is still beloved by party members , but has dropped hints in that direction . <p> " The reality is the Government was previously doing too much , too fast , and the effect of that was being tied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our primary focus needed to be , " he said . <p> Reprioritization work was already underway from December , when Ardern was still leader , but Hipkins has really run with it and made it his own . <p> Budget 2023 has been pitched as the No Frills Budget and Hipkins as the No Frills Prime Minister .

So that will provide NZ with a government consisting of Labour with a faction in its caucus breaking ranks over racial ambitions , the Greens infighting and rancour aplenty and TPM which will require much more than a tail to wag .

He 's a new shade of lipstick on the same old pig , but as we saw back in 2017 , that 's all it takes to convince most people . National were going after the increasingly popular " anyone but Ardern " vote , but now with Hipkins at the helm , you do n't have to vote National to get rid of her anymore . <p> So yes , it will likely be a tight race again , between two similarly aligned parties who will maintain the status quo .

Louise Cook , general manager of the Southern Demonstration &amp; Research Farm for Southern Dairy Hub , seems to think so . <p> The research farm runs four herds with 740 cows -- two herds of 140 cows and two herds of 230 cows -- and she says that making the switch to pelletised minerals has made a huge difference , both in terms of staff morale and time management . <p> Cook says that over the past four years , minerals would have to be dusted , a job she says takes approximately 45 minutes . <p> " We 'd be dusting minerals right through until January , " she told Dairy News . <p> " The person fetching herds is busy at the best of times with the comings and goings we have on the farm , " she says .

An environmental disaster is unfolding in plain sight , " the report 's foreword says . <p> It found lives and livelihoods were put at risk by woody debris and sediment , much of it beyond the ability of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans and regulations were too permissive , consents were ineffective , and monitoring was under-resourced . <p> State Highway 35 was underfunded and not regularly maintained , and systems meant the government was paying too much for large underperforming contracting companies tied up in procurement processes . <p> " Decades of underfunding from narrow investment criteria and reactive storm recovery has resulted in a range of ' band-aids ' being applied to infrastructure that is already critically failing . <p> " The impact that has been inflicted upon the Tai Rawhiti and Wairoa regions is profound . Economic , social and cultural recovery will take years . People reported increased anxiety and depression , fear and paranoia , and feeling overwhelmed , stressed and abandoned . <p> " Much of the current land use is unsustainable . The unintended consequences of successive government strategies and inadequate local authority intervention have arisen from a failure to recognise the complexity of the regions ' well-known geomorphology and people . <p> " The ETS in its current form has created perverse land use outcomes and elements need to be reviewed .

" <p> Over eight weeks , the panel viewed some of the devastation in person , and visited range of forest enterprises .

" <h> Recommendations <p> The 44-page report includes 90 findings and 49 recommendations , the primary ones being to set up an independent Woody Debris Taskforce with funding and involvement from the three councils and the forestry sector . The government should also immediately restrict large-scale clear-felling of plantation forests in Tai Rawhiti and Wairoa . It clarified this was region-specific and should not be applied nationally . <p> One of the biggest overall messages was a move towards a ' mosaic ' approach to land use in high-value land including commercial and production activity alongside biodiversity investment . <p> In the short term , responsibility for recovery efforts should be given to a commissioner , who would oversee all recovery efforts , with a single central fund-holding entity coordinating investments . <p> The report called for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Waipaoa rivers and setting up governance entities , restrictions on plantation forestry , and stronger monitoring of compliance with the rules . This would include a new ' purple ' zoning classification for highly erodable land , which would need to be planted with permanent canopy cover like native forests . <p> The region should be a test region for the government 's resource management reforms <p> On infrastructure , State Highways 2 and 35 should be given sustainable funding and dedicated local contractors should be prioritised for procurement . <p> A backup water supply and electricity that does not rely on out-of-region networking should also be set up , and the ministers should review Overseas Investment Office decisions . <p> They should also seek an explanation for why three forestry companies convicted of environmental offences had their Forest Stewardship Council certification renewed . <p> With Maori land - much of it marginal and with poor accessibility - facing regulatory difficulty and the landowners forced adhere to " each new ad-hoc government imperative for land use " . <p> " It 's underlying tenure is multiply owned , many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests . Getting a governance entity that gives them a legal identity is an arduous process through the Maori land court and neither of those activities are funded at all , " Parata said . <p> She noted water infrastructure for Gisborne was hosted by Maori land , and it was time to give back to those iwi and land owners who had provided this public good . <p> The panel urged funding for a co-investment arrangement for whenua Maori within a year based on the East Coast Exchange approach . <p> The Emissions Trading Scheme should be complemented by a " biodiversity credit " scheme piloted in the region , which could be applied in an international biodiversity market . <p> More should be invested into the " Just Transition " including research and development , exploring new industries , and supporting the existing workforce . The Jobs for Nature and Raukumara Pae Maunga programmes should also be given baseline permanent funding . <p> Parata said the report 's recommendations came as a package and there was no single one which would make the difference . <p> She said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater devastation . <p> " The risks are very high .

@@98822233 <p> Comments on my previous article assume I am a dinosaur and have no idea about the future of cities ; and there is no alternative to what the three headed political hydra dictates . So I reply . <p> I fully support densification of our cities , getting people back living in our central cities and along transport routes . Up zoning , to allow higher buildings is essential . This may be into mid-rises ( 5 to 12 stories -- cost effective to build and houses lots of people -- but there are issues about if people want that and is it good for them ) or low rises but that may create another densification problem in the not too distant future . We ca n't ruin more farmland with greenfield developmnents . And most importantly of all , I want ' affordable ' housing in well designed , nice to live in neighbourhoods , in nice cities . <p> All this central city living will adapt people to not need or use cars , we get less congestion , less infrastrure costs pipes/schools/community facilities etc as when building in greenfields , less cost to build roads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with climate change ; a core challenge our society is facing . And with less imports of costly oil we would be wealthier and healthier . <p> And I welcome new buildings being able to be well designed for all users especially those with special needs . I love the ideas of cities being people friendly for walking and biking like many cities in Europe . I do not have a car so I 'm a full on public transport user or walker ( too dangerous to bike ) so this all 100% suits me and I enthusiastically support all the above . <p> But the National/Labour/Greens ( NLG ) law changes -- zoning changes and Resource Management Act removing objections rights -- will do nothing to deliver affordable housing or liveability . The purpose of changes is to stimulate the private market to build because we have an affordable housing crisis . But history shows a maximise profit ethos ca n't deliver affordable housing . The market fails to deliver affordable housing or we would n't have a crisis . I 've previously linked to the acadmic research paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house prices : Supply and price effects of upzoning over 20 Years ' . This shows affordable housing ca n't be delivered by zoning and bully building law changes with an assumption more ' supply ' brings lower prices . <p> Only government contracting to build has a histroy of making affordable housing . Governent are n't out there looking to maximise profit ; so that means lower mortgages or rents , which leaves more money in the domestic economy to stimulate other businesses . <p> And even with the current market going down the prices are still not affordable . Also first home buyers wo n't pick up these ' lower ' prices because the law changes are creating a maximise profit bonanza for developers to buy houses at a low price and then to ' build to rent ' ( rent for life ) . This ' build to rent ' model is a massive tax give-away to larger developers where they get interest deductability for tax . And they will get relatively wealthy middle class people to pay high rents because those people now ca n't afford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This highly profititable ' build to rent ' ( rent for life ) model will suck huge amounts of our scare investment capital into this non-productive sector ( housing ) and New Zealand ca n't get rich by selling housing to each other . This scare investment capital needs to go to productive export orientated sectors which are starved of capital . <p> The laws on ' build to rent ' put no guidance on pricing rents to make sure they are affordable because , that will be hard to do . Market can do that ? ? This unleashing of the private sector is a classic National party approach to problems . Labour/Greens terrifed of the difficult to solve affordable housing crisis want to be on board with National believing they then wo n't be blamed for the problem . Some people still believe in the tooth fairy . This is a weak fear driven strategy without economic insight . <p> This approach ca n't fix the afforable housing crisis as new builds are not cheap . ( They are also very carbon intensive , and to be cheaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildng is compounded by stimulating the building market , as this will soak up scarce building resources ( people and materials ) which will drive up prices to build reducing the chances of housing being affordable . <p> Also investment demand for housing is still high ( rentals are good income ) and that drives up housing prices , and that means high mortgages , and that high cost is simply passed onto renters . There must be a reduction in investor demand to lower prices -- removing interest deductability ( I certainly pushed that ) was an excellent move to stop investor demand but returning interest deducabiltiy to the ' build to rent ' model simply redirects existing investment into that model leaving existing housing still subject to investment forces that push prices higher . <p> The correct and urgent strategy for Labour and the Greens is to distinguish themselves from National by rolling back the interest deductibity tax breaks for ' build to rent ' .

And government purchasing of existing housing can fix the crisis even quicker e.g. a scheme for housing investors to trade in a rental property for a long term govt financial instrument paying a good rate of interest while repaying capital and interest over a set period ( in the same way an investor would get rental payments ; because investors want income to live ) .

The old Westpac office in Adelaide Road which workers next door used to describe as little more than a flop house at times -- a mixture of good and bad .

Was there a resident caretaker there at all times considering its size and occupants ' circumstances ? How often were inspections by Council and the Ministry for Everything MBIE ?

@@98822234 <h> GUEST BLOG : Ben Morgan -- Pacific Intelligence Update <p> Speaking at the Senate Appropriations Defence Subcommittee on 12 May , the United States most senior military officer , General Mark Miley commented on United States military preparedness and on tensions with China . <p> Although he was clear that war with China was neither inevitable or imminent , General Miley was clear about the potential risks stating that " Chinese actions are moving it on a path toward potential confrontation with its neighbours or the United States . " He also discussed threats posed by Russia , Ukraine and North Korea . However , as General Miley stated none of these nations " has publicly stated that it intends to be the regional hegemon in Asia within the next 10 years and to exceed the United States ' overall military capability by mid-century " or has the military potential of China . <p> The key observation though is that the United States is committed to deterrence ; or to being ready to rapidly deploy military force to at risk areas . General Miley discussing the United States current high state of readiness and stating " To do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readiness in the future -- and there is no other No. 1 priority . " Discussions of this nature are important indicators of future policy and need to be noted and considered by policy makers in the Pacific . <p> For instance , during the Ukraine War the General Miley reported that the United States rapidly deployed the following army units to Europe : <p> A corps ( approximately 30-50,000 soldiers ) <p> Two divisions ( approximately 20-30,000 soldiers ) <p> Three brigade combat teams ( approximately 15-20,000 soldiers ) <p> And ; at the same time doubled the number of fighter squadrons , ships and submarines in Europe ; all within about 35 days . Ukraine demonstrates that General Miley 's military is ready to deploy rapidly to deter aggression and support United States foreign policy . The Pacific could see similar rapid deployments of troops , aircraft and ships if the United States seeks to deter Chinese , North Korean or Russian activity . <p> Countering illegal fishing in Micronesia <p> Illegal fishing is an issue throughout the Pacific , the remote and poorly policed region providing opportunities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation 's fishing grounds .

By supporting smaller nations to govern and manage their EEZs , larger nations support stability and help manage resources . <p> In Palau 's case Japan , Australia and the United States provide command training and communication 's support to Palau 's enforcement agencies .

Supporting Palau to surveil their EEZ contributes valuable information towards the United States wider intelligence picture in Micronesia ; and helps develop local human intelligence networks and relationships . <p> New Zealand announces an increase in defence budget <p> In a small but significant decision the New Zealand government is increasing defence spending by about $747 million over the next four years . The increase is in operational expenditure and includes $ 419 million to increase wages and help retain staff . Recent low employment rates mean that well-trained servicemen and women can easily get jobs and defence force wages were no-longer competitive . <p> The remainder $ 328 million is being spent on renewal of housing stock and other facilities . <p> This spend is important because the New Zealand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zealand services personnel are well-trained , motivated and highly regarded internationally . In recent years the services have haemorrhaged personnel as people that joined the military to serve overseas ; or perform combat roles were utilised to support disaster relief and the response to COVID 19 .

The President 's visit is likely to include the United States and Papua New Guinea signing a Defence Cooperation Agreement . <p> Specifically , the agreement is reported to include United States forces being able to use Papua New Guinean air and sea ports ; including pre-positioning logistics support like fuel , supplies and maintenance facilities for both ships and aircraft . Pre-positioning could also include building new facilities and infrastructure to better support United States personnel and their equipment . Further , the proposal includes opportunities for joint training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to China 's 2022 security agreement with Solomon Islands . The United States and its allies are concerned about potential Chinese military bases in the Solomons . A deal with Papua New Guinea provides the United States and its allies with opportunities to disperse their forces across a range of locations so they are harder to target but still close to Solomon Islands . Commander of the United States Pacific Air Force , General Kenneth Wilsbach , discussed this strategy in an interview with Nikkei stating " Obviously we would like to disperse in as many places as we can to make the targeting problem for the Chinese as difficult as possible . " <p> Previous Pacific Briefs have highlighted the increased Sino-American interest in Pacific real estate ; and this is another example of the race between China and the United States to acquire bases in the Pacific .

It also contains oil and a variety of other resources . <p> This week Russian long-range bombers exercised over the sea . The ancient aircraft conducted refuelling and tactical exercises . An obvious taunt at the United States and although it is unlikely America is very concerned about the threat posed by 70-year-old Tu 95 Bear bombers exercising in the area , this activity is interesting for Pacific observers because it is an example of Russia continuing to try and demonstrate its relevance in the Pacific .

Since then , the party has continued to campaign , win electoral majorities but be prevented from forming a government by vested interests in the military and aristocracy . <p> Real political power in Thailand resides with the senate , a body hand-picked by the military . <p> A Pheu Thai landslide in the upcoming election signals a generational political shift as younger people turn away from traditional power structures . Although inevitable , transitions of this nature are always a de-stabilising factor in politics . If the Thai senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prime Minister from the winning party it could lead to protest and violence ; or even military intervention . The key ' take away ' for Pacific observers is that political uncertainty provides opportunities for outside influence and for unintended consequences . <p> Perhaps a military ' crack down ' responding to a new more liberal government is defeated by mass protests initiating a new Thai government that is not tied to the military and reduces the country 's military budget . Or ; takes a more independent less pro-American foreign policy position . Both situations potentially weakening the Thai-American defence alliance unbalancing the regional balance of power . Or ; a military intervention heralds another authoritarian regime and further undermines democracy in Thailand .

@@98822235 <h> The violence of colonisation in Palestine and Aotearoa <p> This week Israel will celebrate 75 years since its declaration of independence in 1948 while Palestinians will remember the Nakba ( " catastrophe " in Arabic ) in which over 700,000 Palestinians were driven off their land by Israeli militias in 1947-49 . <p> There are not contradictory anniversaries . They are complementary ; one leading directly to the other . <p> Those who have been paying attention will know Palestinians have suffered the colonisation of their country with the theft of their land and denial of their fundamental human rights just as Maori , Aboriginal , black South Africans and " first nations " people across the world suffered similarly under European colonisation . <p> Israel 's master plan for the clearing out of Palestinians , Plan D , which had been prepared alongside the high command of the Haganah , the main Jewish military wing , includes a description of the methods to be used by Israeli militias : <p> " Destruction of villages ( setting fire to , blowing up , and planting mines in the debris ) , especially those population centers which are difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the following guidelines : encirclement of the village and conducting a search inside it . In the event of resistance , the armed force must be destroyed and the population must be expelled outside the borders of the state . " <p> Israeli propagandists say Palestinians left of their own accord -- yeah right ! <p> Similar orders were given to colonial soldiers as they invaded the Waikato and the Maori settlement of Parihaka in the 19th century and Maungapohatu in the 20th . The problem here for the colonial forces was there was nowhere to expel Maori " outside the borders of the state " ! In Palestine it meant murder and mayhem for the local population and forcibly moving Palestinians , many on " death marches " to Gaza and Jordan . <p> Meanwhile people who have n't been paying attention will blame Palestinian " militants " and " terrorists " for the never-ending violence in the Middle East . They will believe this because that 's how Palestinian resistance to colonisation and occupation is portrayed in our media , many instances of which can be found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The reality for Palestinians is that the Nakba has never stopped . Not a day goes by without evictions , house demolitions and forced displacement of Palestinians to make way for Jewish settlers . The Israeli leadership has 19th century European attitudes to the indigenous people of Palestine . <p> Colonial oppression has resulted in what Israel 's largest and most respected human rights group , B'Tselem , describes as " A regime of Jewish supremacy from the Jordan river to the Mediterranean Sea : This is apartheid " . <p> For Israel 's side it says the land of Palestine is the traditional homeland of the Jewish people as declared in holy scriptures and that Jews and only Jews have a right to self-determination there . In 2018 Israel 's Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan declared : " We are telling the world that it does n't matter what the nations of the world say . The time has come to express our biblical right to the land " ; or as Israeli Professor Ilan Pappe puts it bluntly " most Jews are atheists but they believe God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " declared by Gilad Erdan is deeply rooted in mythology which in recent decades historians have comprehensively debunked . <p> Israel also says its military occupation of all historic Palestine is " temporary " until a final settlement is negotiated . But recent Israeli leaders have repeatedly said they have no intention of negotiating peace with Palestinians . But for Palestinians in any case , negotiations are a dead end . The power imbalance between Israel and the US on one side of the table and Palestinians on the other is a recipe for some token " concessions " from Israel but many more decades of Israeli oppression and Palestinian resistance . <p> So how will governments respond to the complementary commemorations next week ? <p> Most Western governments will write polite press releases congratulating Israel on its achievements , but none will write messages congratulating Palestinians for their heroic resistance to military occupation and Israel 's attempts to undermine and delegitimise their struggle for self-determination . <p> No western governments will demand Israel allow Palestinian refugees to return to their land and homes in Palestine despite annual UN General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dating back to 1948 . <p> And none will demand Israel abide by international law and United Nations resolutions -- a demand which is the key to resolving the situation for a Middle East peace based on justice -- the only peace possible . <p> But Palestinians have the tide of history on their side . Opinion around the world is overwhelmingly on their side and is increasing -- the Israeli narrative has run out of steam . People are no longer buying the idea of Israel as a valiant little state facing hostile hordes of Arabs which my generation did growing up the 1960s . <p> People are seeing that for the myth it always was . Israel has always been a colonial aggressor which uses false smears of anti-Semitism as its main defence against its critics . <p> As was the case with South Africa , international solidarity with Palestine and demanding accountability from Israel are the way forward . Leaving the issue to western politicians in a recipe for never-ending violence . <p> Those that did n't heed the inflammatory rhetoric from Syrian and Jordanian radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arabs in Israel have full citizenship , vote and elect representatives to the Knesset . <h> STAY CONNECTED <p> Launched on Friday 1 March , 2013 , the ' TheDailyBlog.co.nz ' unites New Zealand 's leading left/centre-left commentators and progressive opinion shapers to provide the other side of the story on today 's news , media and political agendas.

@@98845230 <h> Down at The End of the Garden by Cloudboy <p> Photo : Supplied <p> Every so often an album is reissued that 's especially deserving . This year 's Record Store Day saw a vinyl repress of a local classic , by a Dunedin band born from the ashes of a larger collective , who used burgeoning musical technology to realise ideas previously outside their reach . <p> Incorporating strings , brass , Indian instrumentation and more on top of samples , drum machine and live instruments , it would be a wildly ambitious record were it released now . It sounds all the more fearless and far-reaching considering it originally came out in 2001 . <p> Formed in 1995 , Cloudboy were a trio that sprang from the ashes of the Dunedin collective Mink . A vehicle for the songs of Demarnia Lloyd , she was joined by Johannes Contag and Craig Monk , both of whom played guitar , but credits for their album are purposefully fuzzy - all three are listed as helping record and arrange , which seems to be the most important thing . <p> Contag , who went on to play in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying " Broadcast-quality home recording was still quite new then , and one of our main instruments was the sampler " , saying it was " like being in a huge playground of sonic possibilities " . <p> That 's the impression you get from listening to the album - no two songs have the same palette , and it 's a credit to the band that they did n't let the untold aural options overwhelm them . At the same time , they aimed high . <p> Around ten years later Monk would go on to study Indian classical music , hints of which can be heard on the album opener ' Teaboy ' , which drops the listener into a soundscape of reversed flute , tabla and sitar . <p> The one and only Cloudboy album , Down at the End of the Garden , was released by Arclife and Loop Records . This reissue comes courtesy of the label that housed their prior EP , Flying Nun . <p> It was mostly recorded in Wellington , but they hailed from Dunedin , which prompted critic Russell Baillie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There 's not a tortured guitar within earshot " . He goes on to say the album " suggests the result of the city 's lo-fi creativity blooming in a digital setting " , which still rings true . <p> There 's certainly a Gothic tinge to much of it , but there are also songs like ' Red Rubicon ' , which jaunts over a Latin rhythm and some rambunctious brass . <p> Contag said recently , " The main aim of Cloudboy was to frame Demarnia 's songs and intimate voice in compelling , unusual and evocative ways " . <p> Combining downbeat pop with ornate arrangements was nothing new at the time - there were hugely influential records in the rearview by Massive Attack , and Portishead ( who Cloudboy were compared to at the time , as well as Bjork ) . <p> But there 's an element of grit here that for me brought to mind fellow New Zealanders Headless Chickens . Nineties touchstones abound , like the lively snare drum and guitar stabs on ' The Long Underwater ' . <p> Cloudboy were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on stage by up to five extra musicians , incorporating theatre into live performances , and in one show , interacting with films from the 1920s . <p> Down at the End of the Garden took four years to assemble , and the results are intriguing twenty years on .

Each track was written by Eno and Gibson , who evidently opened the Rolodex and contacted some notable contributors . <p> There 's writing and production here from the singer Eyelar , Canadian folk musician Leif Vollebekk , Frank Ocean collaborator Buddy Ross , Bon Iver 's Justin Vernon adds vocals to one cut , and another called ' C'm on ' is co-written and produced by Aaron Dessner , of the band The National , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In his Guardian review of Secret Life , critic Ben Beaumont-Thomas points out that Fred Again ... attended a " very posh boarding school " and goes on to call the album " witlessly unimaginative " and " trite " . <p> Class critique notwithstanding , I think the record 's imagination is self-evident , from recognisable instruments submerged in reverb to unclassifiable ones , rhythms creeping out of crowd noise , and melody from chatter . <p> Frankly , Brian Eno making an ambient record will always be good news . and joined as he is here by some famous friends , the results are frequently transportive . <p> Secret Life by Fred again .. &amp; Brian Eno <h> The Raft is Not the Shore by Terrible Sons <p> Photo : Supplied <p> The two members of Christchurch 's Terrible Sons have plenty of musical mileage under their belts from separate projects but have taken their time in releasing a debut .

The album was recorded there too , in the couple 's studio as they alternated between parenting and music-making . <p> In the past , Lauren and Matt have written separately , but this time it was more collaborative . What emerges are ideas about connectivity and community , made plain in tracks like ' Yelling in the Wilderness ' . <p> The album was produced by Tom Healy , who 's shepherded some of this country 's finest mellow-inclined records of recent years , including Tiny Ruins , which he plays guitar in . <p> On their previous EP , Tom encouraged Terrible Sons to experiment sonically , and that continues here - nothing radical , more in the way things are layered , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the services of London 's Urban Soul Orchestra for tracks like ' Asperatus ' , which dips in and out of a more soul-focused feel . <p> In that interview with The Herald , Terrible Sons mention drawing inspiration from their community and neighbours .

The Raft is Not the Shore is from a Buddhist parable , and one of its meanings is to hold your beliefs lightly . In the liner notes Matt mentions the ' entrenched spaces we find ourselves in ' , and wanting to see outside themselves in these songs . <p> That 's clear on tracks like ' Watching and Watching ' , which seems to articulate getting stuck in negative news cycles and losing sight of what 's important .

Food Waste <p> Keeping food scraps out of landfill is a great initiative , but they do n't belong in recycling bins . <p> Instead , put food waste into the food scraps bin . They are collected and turned into clean energy and liquid fertiliser .

However , the ' reforms ' ended there , never to be revisited . <p> The UN was hardly ever a democratic platform , fairly reflecting the realities of the world , whether based on economic influence , demographics or any other indicators - aside , of course , from military might and political hegemony . <p> From the post-WWII geopolitical realities , however , the UN perfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global power paradigm . <p> That paradigm , however , is now shifting , and rapidly so . <p> Calls for reforms have been underway for years , reflected in the activities of the Group of Four ( G4 ) - Brazil , Germany , India and Japan - for example ; and the Sirte Declaration of the African Union ( AU ) in 2005 , among others .

As a rising superpower with close and deepening ties with many countries in the Global South , China rightly believes that it is in its interests to demand inclusion and fair representation for others . <p> This is an unmistakable sign of political maturity by Beijing , which will surely be resisted by the US and other European powers . <p> The West is keen on either maintaining the UNSC 's West-leaning status as it is , or , if it must , engaging in superficial or self-serving reforms .

He represented CD Under 23 in 1980 and played in the tournament held in Christchurch that year alongside peers that included future New Zealand reps Ian Smith , Andrew Jones , Gary Robertson and future Central Stags captain and longtime CDCA colleague , Scott Briasco . <p> He toured Australia with the CD U23 side in 1979 and again in 1981 ( as captain ) -- a certain Whanganui Collegiate old boy named David Kirk was his vice-captain and the team also included future New Zealand rep Tony Blain . Another good memory was when he made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a Plunket Shield match . <p> Over the years that he worked as a stock agent living in a number of rural CD towns , he played for Manawatu , Horowhenua Kapiti , Rangitikei , and Southern Hawke 's Bay in the Hawke Cup competition . <p> A serious knee injury on the rugby field when he was 25 would throw a spanner in the works , but never stopped him from continuing to play cricket and be involved in other sports that he loved . <p> Brooky 's full-time role at CDCA started in 2000 when he began working alongside then CEO Blair Furlong and Gary Pond as a small team responsible for the huge area of the Association . <p> His first role was to oversee and deliver the Milo junior cricket programme in the CD area , the equivalent of today 's Smash Play . <p> " I was in Australia coaching the Horowhenua College First XV on a rugby trip when Blair rang and offered me the job " . <p> " Former CD rep Alec Astle had set up this national development programme for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in each of the Major Associations , so now they needed people to oversee and deliver the programmes regionally . <p> " We also had coaches in our Districts working part-time in the programme , helping with awareness and promotion , coach development and so on -- and many of those people are still involved in our sport today . " <p> Brooke said it was now time to move on and put energy into other parts of his life . <p> " There has been a lot of change in the game and in our DA 's , so it 's an exciting time for a new person to come in and get stuck in " . <p> Some of the biggest changes Brooke has witnessed in almost a quarter of a century with CD Cricket have been the societal changes that have put pressure on the game , the career development space and the growth of the women 's game . <p> " There are a lot of people in the game now who are being paid , with potential to grow their career in sport , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change from a totally amateur set-up with maybe part-time coaches , to a clear career pathway where the DA 's have full-time staff in several roles , has been quite significant . <p> " DA 's are like small businesses now and the skill sets required to run them are quite advanced . My role has changed a lot as well over the years as resources and funding have increased . " <p> A real highlight for Brooke has been his close association with Vanuatu Cricket . The relationship started back in 2011 through a partnership with the ICC and the East Asia Pacific regional development programme . The association still continues today with the friendships he made .

@@98993231 <p> 5G promises increased speed , lower latency , and support for a significantly larger number of connected devices . But the growth in devices and in new applications that will ensue also will expand the attack surface , offering new opportunities for malicious actors to take advantage of security gaps . <p> Plus , as with any new technology , there is a great deal of potential for misconfigurations , errors , and unpatched vulnerabilities while companies are still learning how to deploy and secure 5G at scale . <p> About 75% of communication service providers worldwide said that they had experienced up to six security breaches of 5G networks within the past year , according to a November 2022 survey by GlobalData and Nokia . <p> Half of the respondents said that they experienced an attack that resulted in the leakage of customer data , and nearly three quarters said that an attack had caused a service outage . <p> But 5G networks have a great , built-in security advantages over their predecessors , one of which is network slicing -- the ability to subdivide networks into multiple virtual networks on top of a single physical infrastructure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parameters , and quality of service . <p> This allows different applications to share the same physical infrastructure but also provides an additional layer of isolation and security , creating barriers to attacker movement . <p> " 5G introduced a large number of technical innovations and improvements to 4G technology , but network slicing was one of the most important , " says Doug Gatto , practice development manager , services , at IT services provider Insight , and security benefits are a major advantage . " It can really reduce the impact of a cyber attack by isolating an attack to one slice . " <p> However , a misconfigured 5G network slice is vulnerable to multiple threats , including denial-of-service attacks , man-in-the-middle attacks , and basic configuration attacks , he says . And if the slices are n't designed properly , an attacker could also move from one slice to another , he adds . <p> Gatto says that he 's sure these kinds of attacks are already taking place , though the threat is a relatively new one , and he has n't yet seen public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 5G network slicing is very new . It requires that a carrier have standalone 5G in place , instead of a 5G layer over an existing 4G LTE network . That infrastructure is now becoming widely available , and carriers are just starting to experiment with slicing . <p> For example , in February , Singtel announced a 5G security-as-a-slice capability that will become available " in the next few months . " Also in February , Ericsson released a report calling 5G slicing a " near-term opportunity . " <p> In March , Verizon 's Bryan Schromsky , managing partner for its public-sector unit , said that Verizon plans to begin implementing network slicing at the end of this year . <p> But the security risks surrounding 5G network slices are serious enough that , in December , the National Security Agency and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency , issued a warning and offered advice on mitigating these risks . <p> The security issues are n't limited to attacks on individual slices ; they can also cross between slices if the networks are n't property secured , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow malicious actors to access data from different network slices or deny access to prioritised users , " the report says . <p> Say , for example , a particular device is connected to one network slice , says Abdul Rahman , associate vice president at Deloitte , " All we need to do is Google the vendor website , find out what the default username and password is , and build a script to try that username and password from different points within the network , " he says . <p> Then , once an initial slice has been compromised , that access can be used to pivot to other network slices , and compromise data or devices used by other customers . <h> DoS attacks could degrade service across slices <p> In a DoS attack , a malicious actor floods a network or critical application or component with traffic so every device using the same slice suffers an outage . <p> According to a report released earlier this year by ENEA AdaptiveMobile Security , denial of service attacks against 5G networks can not be mitigated with today 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slices to reduce the reach of DoS attacks by isolating their effect to an individual network segment but only if the infrastructure is properly configured . <p> But some types of attacks can spill over into other slices if proper preventative measures are n't taken . For example , if malware compromises an IoT device connected to the 5G network , and it floods the network with messages , it could degrade signal quality for all network slices that share the same spectrum or other physical resources . <p> Another possibility is that a malicious mobile-edge computing application infects one slice and starts to generate fake and computationally intensive tasks . It will use up edge-computing resources , and , if the malware is able to circumvent compute-resource segmentation policies , it can affect the performance of all the other slices sharing the same edge computing . <p> Deloitte and Virginia Tech released a report in April summarising denial of service attack vectors for 5G networks . <p> " It was a contained study within a lab environment , " says Shehadi Dayekh , 5G and edge specialist leader at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is possible to create resource constraints on the common infrastructure that both slices are using . " <p> In addition , network architects might not want to duplicate every network function on each slice , so an attack on a particular network function might affect every slice that uses it , Dayekh says . <p> In addition , there are some shared resources that all slices have to use . Say , for example , an operator uses 5G network slices to offer private networks to several enterprise clients in the same area . <p> " They would end up using one cell tower to feed multiple clients , " says Dayekh . " You can not replicate the cell tower for each and every single client . So if you 've compromised that specific shared resource , that will end up affecting other clients , as well . " <h> Configuration attacks can lead to wide compromises <p> Those same shared resources can also provide an opportunity for malware to spread between slices , Dayekh says . For instance , a network function might use a common set of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers on different network slices . <p> In this case one customer 's IoT devices might need access to the same network function and its underlying infrastructure as another customer 's connected vehicles . <p> " These are totally different industries and different clients but are served by the same compute nodes that have the same network function , " he says . If there 's a vulnerability within the IoT device that attackers exploit , they could then push malware to other devices that are connected via the same network function . <p> IoT devices are notorious security risks because many of them " are old , and many may have firmware that is old and not patched , " he says . <p> But other network components may also be using default usernames and passwords or have unpatched vulnerabilities , he adds . <p> Proper configuration of both the network infrastructure and shared network services is key , he says . " Do you have ports that are open ? Do you have the right segmentation and not allow users to discover more of these network functions ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacks can have a broad range of adverse effects . A malicious attacker may be able to steal data from other users on the same network slice , but if are weaknesses in the way shared components are accessed , attackers can also gain access to another slice . <p> " In a virtualised architecture it will be more difficult to detect and recognise the types of traffic crossing these networks and mitigate against any new threats , " CISA warns . <h> Man-in-the-middle attacks endanger data <p> 5G network slices are also vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks , CISA says , where an attacker jumps into the middle of an unencrypted conversation between two network participants . There it can listen to their communication to steal data , pass along corrupted data , or shut down or slow the communication . <p> " Such an attack could be devastating , as misinformation and disinformation could result from the malicious actor modifying the contents of the messages , " CISA says . <h> How to secure network slices <p> ZTA , together with multi-layer security , encryption , and isolation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slices and across different slices . <p> Monitoring can detect malicious activity , but many tools focus on performance and not on malicious attacks , the agency warns . <p> Network operators want to have performance monitoring and quality-of-service monitoring , says Insight 's Gatto . " But you actually need control-plane monitoring , monitoring the logic of the actual network to make sure it 's protected against any malicious actors . " <p> Operators should also consider anomaly-detection and intrusion-prevention systems , he adds . These can identify and stop dangerous behaviors . <p> Network security starts with having good visibility , says Deloitte 's Dayekh . " Knowing where your infrastructure is , knowing what resources each component is using , tracking IoT devices , and tracking connected devices , whether known or unknown devices . Once you have that visibility , you can start applying policies and rules around securing that connectivity . " <p> However , the expansion and deployment of Kubernetes services and containerised deployment of telecommunication functions present a challenge for carriers , says Deloitte 's Dayekh . <p> " It 's becoming harder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic and over access , and it 's just adding to the complexity of visibility , detection , and response , " he says . " Especially when you have hundreds if not thousands of new devices joining the network every single day . " <p> Finally , carriers need to have a plan for when prevention measures fail . <p> It 's important to be prepared for an attack if one does occur , says Dayekh . " What is your plan of action if something falls down ? You should have a method in order to control and be able to prevent any further damage in your network , " he says . <h> Real-world attacks have yet to surface <p> Deloitte runs tests on its lab environments that are connected to major cloud hyperscalers , Dayekh says . " You can tell that IoT devices have multiple vulnerabilities , open ports , and outdated software , " he says . " It 's clear , if you look at it , that major organisations do n't have , at this point , the full visibility into what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says he has n't seen successful attacks on vulnerable slices in the wild , but , " I am sure that these slices exist , and I 'm sure the same vulnerabilities apply to those slices . " <p> Insight 's Gatto says he also has n't seen public-facing data about network slices being successfully attacked , " but it probably is happening . " <p> One ray of hope is that , in the short term , network slicing attacks are going to be harder to accomplish because of the way cellular technologies work , says Gatto. " 5G , in general , is secure by default , unlike Wi-Fi , which is open by default , so it would be harder to compromise . " <p> With Wi-Fi , all you need is a password or some type of secure certificate exchange to join a network , but with 5G , you 'll need a physical SIM card or an eSim even to join a network or network slice , he says . <p> The attacks themselves would need to be considerably complex in order to succeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global cybersecurity firm Sophos . " To date , almost no one outside of a nation-state has the resources to conduct an attack like this effectively , " he says . <p> Still , Wisniewski urges caution . <p> " If you are adopting 5G for mission-critical applications , you should n't assume it will always be available and unhackable , " he says . " Like any device communicating over a public network , devices should always use encryption and verify both client and server identities before communicating .

@@98993237 <p> You 'd be hard pressed to find another technology that has been as useful , successful , and ultimately influential as Ethernet , and as it celebrates its 50th anniversary this week , it is clear that Ethernet 's journey is far from over . <p> Since its invention by Bob Metcalf and David Boggs back in 1973 , Ethernet has continuously been expanded and adapted to become the go-to Layer 2 protocol in computer networking across industries . <p> " To me , the most interesting aspect of Ethernet is its universality , meaning it has been deployed literally everywhere including under the oceans and in outer space . Ethernet use cases are still expanding with new physical layers -- for example high-speed Ethernet for cameras in vehicles , " said Andreas Bechtolsheim , cofounder of Sun Microsystems and Arista Networks , now chairman and chief development officer for Arista . <p> " The most impactful area for Ethernet at this point is inside large cloud data centers which have shown high growth including interconnecting AI/ML clusters which are ramping up quickly , " Bechtolsheim said . <h> Ethernet has broad applications . <p> Flexibility and adaptability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " has become the default answer for any communication network , whether it is connecting devices or computers , which means that in nearly all cases there is no need to invent yet another network . " <p> When COVID hit , Ethernet was an important part of how businesses responded , said Mikael Holmberg , distinguished system engineer with Extreme Networks . " Looking back at the sudden shift to remote work during the global COVID outbreak , one of Ethernet 's most transformative applications is undoubtedly its role in facilitating a distributed workforce , " he said . <p> That shift put pressure for more bandwidth on communication service providers . " This demand was driven by enterprise employees working remotely , students transitioning to online education , and even increased online gaming due to social distancing mandates , " Holmberg said . " In essence , thanks to Ethernet being the foundational technology used for the internet , it enabled individuals to carry out a variety of tasks efficiently from the comfort of their own homes .

" Ethernet facilitates seamless connectivity between mission-critical subsystems , like sensors , cameras , controls , and telemetry inside vehicles and devices , such as satellites and probes . It 's also a key part of ground-to-space and space-to-ground communications . " <p> As a more capable replacement for legacy Controller Area Network ( CAN ) and Local Interconnect Network ( LIN ) protocols , Ethernet has become the backbone of in-vehicle networks , Jones said , including cars and drones . " Unmanned Aerial Vehicles ( UAVs ) and Unmanned Underwater Vehicles ( UUVs ) that enable environmental monitoring of atmospheric conditions , tides and temperatures , and next-generation autonomous surveillance and security systems all rely on Ethernet , " Jones said . <h> Ethernet development presses on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of high-level resources dedicated to continuing the technical work to improve Ethernet 's features , said John D'Ambrosia , Chair , IEEE P802.3dj Task Force , which is developing the next generation of Ethernet electrical and optical signaling . <p> " It is just fascinating to me to watch the development and the way Ethernet brings the industry together to solve problems -- and this cooperation has been going on a very long time and will only get stronger as time goes on , " D'Ambrosia , said . <p> While the ever-increasing top speed of Ethernet grabs a lot of attention , there is just as much effort to develop and enhance slower speed 2.5Gbps , 5Gbps , and 25Gbps Ethernet , which has led to development of a rather large market , to say the least . <p> According to Sameh Boujelbene , vice president , data center and campus Ethernet switch market research forDell'Oro Group , nine billion Ethernet switch ports have shipped during the last two decades , for a total market value of well over $450 billion . " Ethernet has played a pivotal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wide range of industries but , more importantly , in connecting people worldwide , " Boujelbene said . <p> " The Ethernet portfolio continues to expand , encompassing higher speeds and game-changing advances such as Power over Ethernet ( PoE ) , Single Pair Ethernet ( SPE ) , Time-Sensitive Networking ( TSN ) , and more , " Boujelbene said . ( SPE defines a way to handle Ethernet transmission via a single pair of copper wires . TSN is a standard way to provide deterministic and guaranteed delivery of data over a network . ) <h> Evolving technologies rely on Ethernet <p> As cloud services , including virtual reality ( VR ) , progress , managing latency is becoming of paramount importance , Holmberg said . " Addressing this issue will likely involve the use of Ethernet coupled with the Precision Time Protocol , enabling Ethernet to evolve into a connectivity technology with defined latency objectives , " he said . <p> Support of large-scale distributed systems where synchronised operations are essential requires timing precision on the order of hundreds of nanoseconds . " A prime example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the realm of 5G networks and eventually 6G networks , " Holmberg said . <p> Ethernet networks that offer predefined latency could also benefit enterprise LANs , particularly to address the requirements of technologies like AI , he said , but also to synchronise GPUs across data centers . " In essence , the future of Ethernet seems entwined with emerging technological paradigms , shaping how they function and evolve , " Holmberg said . <p> Setting up the infrastructure for AI computing and application development will also be a key area of Ethernet expansion , D'Ambrosia said . AI requires many servers that require low-latency connections , " So , the high-density interconnect becomes a big deal . And because you 're trying to do things faster than the latency becomes an issue because you got to solve these problems and use error correction to get additional channel performance . There are lots of issues there . " <p> New services that are driven by AI -- such as generative artwork -- will require enormous infrastructure investments that use Ethernet as a foundational communications layer , said Jones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the continued growth of the services expected from devices and the network , Jones added . " These new tools will continue to propel the evolution of technology consumption in and out of the work environment , " Jones said . <p> Even the expansion of wireless networks will require more use of Ethernet . " In the first place , you can not have wireless without wired . All wireless access points require a wired infrastructure , " said Greg Dorai , senior vice president , Cisco Networking . " And the massive-scale data centers that power the cloud , AI , and other technologies of the future are all connected together by wires and fiber , all going back to Ethernet switches . " <p> The need to reduce Ethernet power draw is also driving its development . <p> For example , Energy-Efficient Ethernet , which powers down links when there is not a lot of traffic , would be useful when minimising power consumption is essential , said George Zimmerman : Chair , IEEE P802.3dg 100Mb/s Long-Reach Single Pair Ethernet Task Force . That includes in automobiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Energy efficiency is a big deal in all areas of Ethernet . It controls the complexity of many of the things we do , " he said . That increasingly includes industrial control systems and other operational technology , " however , we have a long way to go before it matches Ethernet 's ubiquity in IT . " <p> Because of its ubiquity , vast numbers of IT pros are trained in using Ethernet , which makes it attractive in areas that currently use proprietary protocols . So rather than relying on a relatively small pool of people familiar with them , organisations can draw from a much larger pool and tap into the decades of Ethernet development . " And so Ethernet becomes this foundation that the engineering world is built on , " Zimmerman said . <p> That status projects continued development of the technology and its expanding uses . <p> " Whatever the future holds , Bob Metcalf 's Ethernet will be there connecting everything together , even if it may be in a form even Bob would n't recognise , " Dorai said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want it to , may be traveling over Ethernet to appear in a press conference for the 60-year anniversary .

They called for action to rein in the fast-evolving technology . <p> The G7 , which includes include the U.S. , Japan , Germany , Britain , France , Italy , Canada and the EU , stressed that efforts to create trustworthy AI need to include " governance , safeguard of intellectual property rights including copyrights , promotion of transparency , and response to foreign information manipulation , including disinformation . <p> " We recognise the need to immediately take stock of the opportunities and challenges of generative AI , which is increasingly prominent across countries and sectors , " the G7 leaders said . More specifically , they called for the creation of a G7 working group by the end of the year to tackle possible generative AI solutions . <p> The G7 summit followed a " digital ministers " meeting last month , where members called for " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AI poses a number of threats to humanity , so it 's important to ensure it continues to serve humans and not the other way around , according to Avivah Litan , a vice president and distinguished analyst at Gartner Research . <p> Everyday threats include a lack of transparency in generative AI models , which makes them unpredictable ; even vendor " do n't understand everything about how they work internally , " Litan said in a blog post last week . And , because there 's no verifiable data governance or protection assurances , generative AI can steal content at will and reproduce it , violating intellectual property and copyright laws . <p> Additionally , chatbots and other AI-based tools can produce inaccurate or fabricated " hallucinations " because their output is only as good as the data input , and that ingestion process is often tied to the internet . The result : disinformation , " malinformation " and misinformation , Litan noted . <p> " Regulators should set timeframes by which AI model vendors must use standards to authenticate provenance of content , software , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from C2PA , Scitt.io , IETF for examples , " Litan said . <p> At an AI conference at MIT earlier this month , Hinton warned that because AI can be self-learning , it will become exponentially smarter over time and will begin thinking for itself . Once that happens , there 's little to stop what Hinton believes is inevitable -- the extinction of humans . <p> " These things will have learned from us by reading all the novels that ever where and everything Machiavelli ever wrote about how to manipulate people , " Hinton told a packed house during a QA exchange . " And if they 're much smarter than us , they 'll be very good at manipulating us . You wo n't realise what 's going on . You 'll be like a two-year-old who 's being asked , ' Do you want the peas or the cauliflower , ' and does n't realise you do n't have to have either . And you 'll be that easy to manipulate . " <h> Europe moves to slow AI <p> The G7 statement came after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Act , which would reign in generative tools such as ChatGPT , DALL-E , and Midjourney in terms of design and deployment , to align with EU law and fundamental rights , including the need for AI makers to disclose any copyrighted material used to develop their systems . <p> " We want AI systems to be accurate , reliable , safe and non-discriminatory , regardless of their origin , " European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Friday . <p> Earlier this month , the White House also unveiled AI rules to address safety and privacy . The latest effort by the Biden Administration built on previous attempts to promote some form of responsible innovation , but to date Congress has not advanced any laws that would regulate AI . Last October , the administration unveiled a blueprint for an " AI Bill of Rights " as well as an AI Risk Management Framework ; more recently , it pushed for a roadmap for standing up a National AI Research Resource . <p> The measures , however , do n't have any legal teeth " and they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The United States has been something of a follower in developing AI rules . China has led the world in rolling out several initiatives for AI governance , though most of those initiatives relate to citizen privacy and not necessarily safety . <p> " We need clear guidelines on development of safe , fair and responsible AI from the US regulators , " Litan said in an earlier interview . " We need meaningful regulations such as we see being developed in the EU with the AI Act . While they are not getting it all perfect at once , at least they are moving forward and are willing to iterate . US regulators need to step up their game and pace . " <p> In March , Apple co-founder and form chief engineer Steve Wozniak , SpaceX CEO Elon Musk , hundreds of AI experts and thousands of others put their names on an open letter calling for a six-month pause in developing more powerful AI systems , citing potential risks to society . A month later , EU lawmakers urged world leaders to find ways to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected . <h> Open AI 's Sam Altman on AI : ' I 'm nervous ' <p> Last week , the US Senate held two separate hearings during which members and experts who testified said they see AI as a clear and present danger to security , privacy and copyrights . Generative AI technology , such as ChatGPT can and does use data and information from any number of sometimes unchecked sources . <p> Sam Altman , CEO of ChatGPT-creator OpenAI , was joined by IBM executive Christina Montgomery and New York University professor emeritus Gary Marcus in testifying before the Senate on the threats and opportunities chatbots present . " It 's one of my areas of greatest concern , " Altman said . " The more general ability of these models to manipulate , persuade , to provide one-on-one interactive disinformation -- given we 're going to face an election next year and these models are getting better , I think this is a significant area of concern . " <p> Regulation , Altman said , would be " wise " because people need to know if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- images , videos or documents -- generated by a chatbot . " I think we 'll also need rules and guidelines about what is expected in terms of disclosure from a company providing a model that could have these sorts of abilities we 're talking about . So , I 'm nervous about it . " <p> Altman suggested the US government craft a three-point AI oversight plan : <p> Form a government agency charged to license large AI models and revoke those that do n't meet government standards . <p> Create large language model ( LLM ) safety standards that include the ability to evaluate whether they 're dangerous or not . LLMs would have to pass safety tests such as not being able to " self-replicate , " go rogue , and start acting on their own . <p> The Senate also heard testimony that the use of " watermarks " could help users identify where content generate from chatbots comes from . Lynne Parker , director of the AI Tennessee Initiative at the University of Tennessee , said requiring AI creators to insert metadata breadcrumbs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provenance . <p> The senate plans a future hearing on the topic of watermarking AI content . <h> Microsites <h> Featured <h> Slideshows <h> Channel leaders unite at Reseller News Influencer Network <p> ?

@@98993239 <p> Meta has been fined $1.3 billion ( ? 1.2 billion ) by the Irish Data Protection Commission ( DPC ) for violating the terms of the EU 's GDPR by continuing to transfer EU users ' data to the US without adequate safeguards . <p> Meta has failed to " address the risks to the fundamental rights and freedoms " of Facebook 's European users , the DPC said in a statement . In addition to the fine , Meta has been given five months to stop the transfer of Facebook data to the US via so-called standard contractual clauses ( SCCs ) . <p> SCCs have been used by companies to transfer EU data to the US since the Court of Justice of the European Union ( CJEU ) ruled that the Privacy Shield agreement that was in place to facilitate the flow of data did not sufficiently protect data from US spy agencies . The ruling , in 2020 , struck down the agreement and tightened requirements around the use of SCCs , a separate legal tool that was also being widely used by companies to transfer data to the US . <p> Ireland 's DPC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tighten rules around SCCs , the CJEU said that " Data controllers or processors that intend to transfer data based on SCCs must ensure that the data subject is granted a level of protection essentially equivalent to that guaranteed by the General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ) and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights ( CFR ) . " <p> However , the DPC said that Meta 's SCCs do not protect EU citizens ' data from US government mass surveillance programs , potentially calling into question the ability of any company to transfer EU citizens ' data to the US . <p> Among other issues , " There were no avenues for either EU or US data subjects to be informed of whether their personal data was being collected or further processed , and no opportunities to obtain access , rectification , or erasure of data , " the DPC said . <p> The " fundamental conflict of law " that exists between the US government 's rules on access to data and the privacy rights of Europeans is not one that Meta or any other business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader of the UK 's Liberal Democrats political party and current Meta president of global affairs , and Jennifer Newstead , chief legal officer , wrote in a blog post . <p> He further said that the company was " disappointed to have been singled out " when thousands of other companies had been using the same SCCs and , as a result , Meta will appeal the ruling in addition to what the company described as an " unjustified and unnecessary fine . " <p> The fine is the largest imposed by a European regulator , eclipsing the $877 million ( ? 746 million ) levied against Amazon in 2021 for similar privacy violations . <p> The requirement to stop the storage of the personal data of EU individuals that it transferred unlawfully is a massive undertaking to carry out , financially , technically and logistically , said Nigel Jones , co-founder of Privacy Compliance Hub , a provider of privacy compliance products . It 's difficult to see how Meta can cease the transfers and bring its processing within the law in the time given . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeal to the courts in an attempt to further delay implementation of the decision , " he said . " In the meantime it will hope that the EU and the US can agree a mechanism known as the Data Privacy Framework that will enable Meta and other companies to legally transfer the data of EU individuals to the US . " <p> However , while the EU Commission concluded in December 2022 that the framework provides privacy safeguards comparable to those of the EU , there is still a number of legislators that need to weigh in on the agreement before it can finally be approved . <p> Once the European Data Protection Board ( EDPB ) has given its approval , the EU Commission must then seek approval from a committee comprising representatives from EU member states , as well as the European Parliament , which has a right of scrutiny over adequacy decisions .

Pressure has been exacerbated by Cyclone Gabrielle but it comes on the back of a tough three years , with Covid-19 , fuel hikes , high inflation resulting in significant interest rate rises , and continuous wet weather all thrown into the mix . <p> Pressure is compounding with increased operational costs , staffing / employment issues , market instability and contractual issues . The already low log price ( which is expected to drop again next month ) , will definitely mean reduction of harvest targets and cancelled contracts , which many will not be able to endure this time round , says FICA spokesperson Ross Davis . <p> " A recent survey of our members showed a widespread reduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of respondents indicated their production had been reduced by 20 per cent or more , with 16 per cent down more than 30 per cent , " Ross says . <p> " When asked if they could survive at an 80 per cent production level for a year , only 26 per cent of respondents indicated that they could . " <p> " At the moment 21 per cent of the responding contractors do not have a current contract while 40 per cent only have a one-year contract . " <p> In recent weeks , two larger Gisborne-based contractors have had no option but to cease operations and ' shut up shop ' , after operating in Gisborne for 15-20 plus years . <p> " Each day we are getting phone calls that confirm more and more contractors are falling over .

By the time modern medicine steps in with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The logical conclusion is that we need to step in sooner to stop the horsemen in their tracks -- or better yet , prevent them altogether , " writes Dr Attia . <p> While most of us will live to somewhere in our 70s and 80s , we will most likely die a " slow " death from a chronic condition that began many years before . <p> Years of ill health are not inevitable , he argues , and modern medicine is not delivering when it comes to prevention . He cites our treatment for type 2 diabetes . " It begins long before someone crosses that magical diagnostic threshold on a blood test . Type 2 diabetes is merely the last stop on the line . Yet , too often , the point of clinical diagnosis is where our interventions begin . Why is this OK ? " <h> Advertisement <p> " The NHS is great for diagnosis , treatment and acute care . When I had a heart attack , they put a stent in . " And yet , " he says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the many drugs I 've been prescribed , I 've had very few words about the importance of diet and exercise . <p> " People have to understand that ageing by itself does n't have to be a cause of major problems until our 90s ; think of the Queen working two days before her death . Yes , we need a bit of luck to avoid diseases that we ca n't prevent like Parkinson 's and Alzheimer 's , but there are many other factors , and a major one is loss of mental and physical fitness . " <p> To this end , Sir Muir does 12 minutes of exercise in the morning to build strength , stands on one leg while brushing his teeth for balance and coordination , and does 30 minutes of brisk walking daily . <p> He is also soon to launch what he calls a new health service for people who are 60-plus , which will focus on helping people age well and learn from others with similar conditions . " My approach is PDSR -- preventing , delaying , slowing down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ageing research at King 's College London , also sees the value of self-care : " When people think of healthcare they think of going to see a doctor , but I 'm thinking about lifestyle interventions to maintain wellness . Not just taking care of our muscles and our heart and our brain , but also our psychological well-being , to reduce factors that quicken the onset of ageing conditions . " <p> For Attia , reducing our risks of chronic illness and increasing healthspan lies in five key pillars : exercise ; " nutritional biochemistry " ( ie what and how much we eat ) ; sleep ; emotional health ; and drugs and supplements ( where necessary ) . <p> This healthspan prescription will not be the same for everyone , as we all respond differently and have different needs . It 's also not enough to focus on just one element ; we have to think of our health holistically as everything is connected . The message then is clear : ageing well is , to a large degree , up to us and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr Attia puts it : " You are no longer a passenger on this ship ; you 're its captain . " <h> Ways to be healthier for longer <h> Build your own Centurian Decathlon <p> " Exercise has the greatest power to determine how you will live out the rest of your life . It delays the onset of chronic diseases , pretty much across the board , but it is also amazingly effective at extending and improving healthspan , " writes Dr Attia . To this end , he asks clients to list the 10 most important physical tasks they want to do for the rest of their lives . <h> Advertisement <p> These include activities like hiking , picking up a grandchild , carrying groceries , and lifting a suitcase into a plane . <p> Inevitably , most people want to continue to do all 10 as they get older , but in order to do these things , it 's important to be specific about the exercise required , which will be a mix of cardiovascular fitness and strength training as muscle mass declines . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if you do it to excess , is not going to deliver results and may lead to injury . And you need to be doing much more exercise than you think to protect against the inevitable decline . Dr Attia 's decathlon includes archery , hiking for an hour with a 9kg backpack ( known as rucking ) , five pull-ups and swimming half a mile ( 0.8 of a kilometre ) in 20 minutes . <h> Practise standing up from sitting on the floor and grip strength <p> " Strength is such an important part of ageing , " says Dr Attia . " If you look at the majority of people over the age of 75 and 80 , you 'll be struck by how many activities they ca n't do because they lack strength . " <p> Many people of a certain age ca n't stand up from sitting on the floor because they do n't have the strength in their hip muscles . Yet studies have shown not being able to do this can predict a greater likelihood of mortality . <p> Similarly , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or do up buttons , you may need to work on your grip strength , which is strongly correlated with a risk of dementia . Attia recommends simply walking carrying weights , or even better carrying them out in front of you . " Being able to carry heavy things is a very important skill as we age , and speaks to lots of abilities : fitness , grip strength , stability , " he says . <p> Sir Muir Grey advises aiming for a plank for the same number of seconds as your age . <h> Strive to be healthy at work <p> We spend most of our time at work , and as the population ages and we retire later , more of us are working later in life . Dr Richard Siow of KCL says it becomes even more important that our workplace is not contributing to physical and emotional stress . " If you 're sitting in front of a computer for long hours , take regular breaks to avoid back pain . Choose healthy food from the canteen , walk outdoors in your lunch hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a four-day week , " he says . <h> Work out what diet is best for you <p> Although Dr Attia has talked about favouring the keto diet for himself in his book , he does not recommend one particular diet . Yet clearly , most of us are eating too much of the wrong thing and the modern 24/7 availability of food makes it hard to stick to a regime . <p> " For a majority of patients , the goal is to reduce energy intake while adding lean mass . This means we need to find ways to get them to consume fewer calories , while also increasing their protein intake , and pair this with proper exercise , " he says . <p> Some people achieve this by cutting carbs , fasting , or calorie counting ; the key message here is to monitor your weight closely , measure your fat and muscle mass and take action . <h> Take good care of your emotional and brain health <p> " Emotional health may represent the most important component of healthspan , " says Attia . " Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happiness , fulfilment , and connection to others . " <p> It is also closely linked to our physical health and mortality . Attia cites dialectical behaviour therapy ( DBT ) , a type of talking , or cognitive behavioural therapy , as a technique that helped him . <p> Dr Siow points out that : " If we 're depressed we 're not going to be exercising or eating well . We will not be financially productive and it could be downhill from there . " <p> Outlive : The Science and Art of Longevity , by Dr Peter Attia with Bill Gifford ( Vermilion )

As it 's a late-night departure , scheduled for 11.35pm , the airport was quiet and getting through it a breeze . A business class ticket entitles you to entry to the excellent Auckland Airport Strata Lounge . It is usually uncrowded and there 's plenty of freshly made food from the onsite kitchen , a self-help bar facilities , non-alcoholic beverages and large showers .

Photo / Grant Bradley <h> Business class cabin configuration <p> There are 18 Business Class seats . One is reserved for resting pilots . They are in a 2-2-2 layout meaning those with window seats do n't have direct aisle access and unlike on many airlines you 're always going to have someone sitting next to you . But this is deliberate -- Hawaiian Airlines targets the high-end leisure market and figures it is mainly couples , families and friends who travel with them rather than corporate travellers . And if you are travelling with someone you know the configuration is excellent -- it makes for a lovely social experience and although the cabin is reasonably open , you feel you have a lot of privacy . If along the window sides of the cabin , as we were , it is possible to step around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out without disturbing their sleep , it is that spacious . The pairing of seats is what makes this product what it is -- ideal for couples travelling together . And if you do want a bit of time apart there 's a divider that slides up from the centre console for more privacy . There 's an important footnote here : Hawaiian is introducing new cabins and radically different business class suites in a 1-2-1 configuration and privacy doors - more in keeping with many other airlines to its new Dreamliners from the beginning of next year . But the slightly smaller A330s with a smaller premium cabin will be on the NZ route for the foreseeable future .

Highly intuitive , this drives a single motor in the seat and gets you to horizontal in a pacy 21 seconds . When it 's time to sleep , you 're given a topper pad mattress on top of the rich brown leather and you 're given a duvet and a large pillow . At foot level , there is a sturdy ottoman fixed in place with a high outer barrier to create separation from the aisle . Below the recline dial are buttons to control lights , call the flight attendant ( there were three assigned to the cabin ) a USB port and on the front end of a console a universal AC power port . All around are plenty of nooks and crannies to store your gear and if you have to get your laptop out the fold-out table is an ideal workspace . <p> You 're served a main meal soon after wheels up on the Hawaiian Airlines flight from Auckland to Honolulu .

In the large and spotless toilet at the front of the cabin there is Makiki Valley hand and body balm and hydrating mist available .

Other airlines could learn something from it . <h> The price <p> Entry prices into Business Class start at around $2500 one-way but high demand pushes that up . That 's about four to five times the best Economy fare .

I do n't think that that 's acceptable , having indicated back in 2020 that he was intending to dispose of them , he should have done that . " <p> The Herald can also reveal that Wood 's wife , Auckland councillor Julie Fairey , has been forced to correct a declaration of interest she filed to council last October stating neither she nor her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and neither of them had a beneficial interest in a trust . <p> This is incorrect , given Wood 's ownership of airport shares . <p> The shares are worth about $13,000 at today 's prices . <p> Wood 's decision about the North Shore Airport 's application was made in 2021 when he still held ministerial responsibility for aviation , which includes regulating airports . <p> Michael Woods and Prime Minister Chris Hipkins . Photo / Michael Craig <p> Transport Officials in March 2021 recommended the small Dairy Flat airfield get airport authority status , saying they " did not see evidence to suggest that the airport will not be able to satisfactorily carry out the responsibilities of an airport authority and therefore no reason why it should not be granted " . <p> Wood told the Herald the decision to decline the airport 's application " was made after carefully considering the overwhelmingly negative feedback from the community and advice from officials " . <p> " I have already acknowledged that this conflict was mismanaged , and it 's a mistake that I take full responsibility for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority status would be a step towards building a longer runway at the North Shore airfield for " small regional turboprop aircraft to operate " , and help by " growing air connectivity " to regions such as Great Barrier Island , the Coromandel and the Far North . <p> There is no suggestion Wood acted inappropriately given his shareholding in Auckland Airport , which has an effective monopoly on flights from the region . Airport authority status is not required to operate an airport , but it does make it easier for them to grow . <p> North Shore Airport operates some commercial services despite lacking authority status , although the briefing said giving the airport authority status could allow larger planes and more services . <p> Most New Zealand airports have the status , according to the Ministry of Transport . <p> In a letter to the airport last year , Wood noted the Airports Authorities Act gives ministers discretion on whether or not to grant authority status , and allows them discretion on the criteria they use to make the final call . <p> National 's acting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the North Shore decision . <p> " The first thing he should have done is sell the shares .

He has kept his workplace relations and Minister for Auckland portfolios and been given a pathway back into the fold - if he cleans up the mess he has landed himself in . <p> Hipkins said Wood retained his confidence for now , describing the minister as " hardworking and conscientious " . <p> But Wood 's pathway to redemption does not change the narrative of ministerial mishaps engulfing Hipkins ' leadership . Hipkins has now stood down a minister every six and a half weeks on average since he took office . <p> If his predecessor , Jacinda Ardern faced a similar attrition rate , she would have churned through an entire Cabinet before finishing her second term . <p> National leader Christopher Luxon accused Hipkins of being " soft and weak " , saying Wood should have been stood down on Friday night when Hipkins became aware of the shares . <p> " I would have stood him down immediately , " Luxon said . <p> " We want a leader and a prime minister that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media to actually make him do the right thing , " he said . <p> For Hipkins , the final straw was that Wood had told the Cabinet Office " on a number of occasions " he was selling the shares , but yet he never got around to actually getting rid of them . <p> The fact he repeatedly gave incorrect information to the Cabinet Office was " quite a material issue " , Hipkins said . <p> Wood said he had begun the process of selling the shares last year but this had stalled after he " came across a hitch " . <p> " I needed information back from the share register that did n't arrive , I think because they had an old email address and , in the reality of the fairly busy life that I have , I did n't get back to it , " Wood said . <p> " Now , that 's not an excuse , that 's the honest answer , " he said . <p> National Party leader Christopher Luxon said he would have stood Michael Wood down immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood down after meeting with Hipkins yesterday . Hipkins " set out his expectations " to Wood in the meeting , including that the shares be sold , and that Wood quickly correct previous editions of Parliament 's pecuniary interests register to identify that Wood has owned the shares the entire time he has been an MP . <p> The suspension came after the Herald revealed Wood had not corrected his pecuniary interest statements to reflect the fact he owned the shares . Wood had thought they were held in a trust and that he did not have to declare them . <p> Wood had declared the shares with the Cabinet Office , reflecting the fact they potentially conflicted with his transport portfolio , which had responsibility for the regulation of the aviation sector until that responsibility was shifted to an associate minister in June 2022 . <p> Kieran McAnulty will take the transport portfolio on an acting basis in the interim .

Photo:Diane McCarthy . <p> Kawerau District Council says that after months of investigation , the cause of the brown water coming from people 's taps is becoming clearer , and hopefully the water will follow suit . <p> The council 's water services team have been working hard to get to the bottom of the sporadic brown colouring of the water , says Mayor Faylene Tunui . <p> " We 've got a very intricate system of 70-odd kilometres of pipes , and just under 10 million litres of water that are held in the reservoirs . They 've been looking into every nook and cranny of that system .

" <p> Operations and services manager Hanno Van der Merwe says the council used three water sources to supply the town , the Tarawera bore , the Umukaraka spring and Te Wai o Marukaa , known colloquially as the Pumphouse spring . <p> For the next three weeks , the council would change its water source to the Tarawera bore as higher than usual levels of manganese had been traced to the Marukaa spring . <p> Hanno says due to heavy rainfall over the past six months , the council stopped taking water from the Umukaraka spring in December , because of the possibility of contamination of the spring from increased levels of groundwater . <p> The council has been using the Marukaa spring , which has been reliably supplying the town for the past 70 years . However , Hanno says tests showed the spring had recently been showing increased levels of manganese , which turns brown when it is mixed with chlorine . This was most likely caused by high ground water levels . <p> At 0.2 milligrams per litre , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manganese required for New Zealand drinking water standards , making it safe to drink . However , this was quadruple the level the spring was producing previously . <p> He says it took some time for the water to turn brown once the chlorine was added .

And floating rates have pretty much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen into a habit of making much smaller changes but more frequently , and this has the ' advantage ' of keeping them a low target . <p> So it is worthwhile to take a look at how carded mortgage rate offers have changed over this period . We are in a low-activity period in our housing cycle with unusually low transaction volumes and a once-in-a-generation event ( or once in two generations ? ) of falling house prices . <p> What we have ended up with is a very narrow rate curve with rates for most terms bunched together , and in fact with some of the longer rates lower than the shorter ones . <p> But we have also recently had a data drop from the RBNZ that allows us a new perspective on how new borrowers focus on the fixed terms they choose . There is more variability here than you might expect . <p> Surprising ( to me at least ) is now much floating rate commitments still feature for new borrowers . This is still the most expensive mortgage rate you can have , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in April 2023 , more than 20% of all these new mortgages were put on this rate . And it is not as though this is a changing proportion . When the RBNZ data starts in April 2021 , it was 19% . <p> In April 2021 , almost half of all new mortgages went on a one year fixed rate . Back then the average bank rate was 2.25% . The popularity of the one year fixed term fell from there but by April 2023 it is still taken up by 30% of borrowers . The average bank rate rose to 6.65% . And this is when the average three year rate is lower at 6.35% . <p> However , the really big movers have been the rise in popularity of the two year rate , from about 13% of all loans then to about a quarter now .

This version is now corrected . ) <p> For one to three years fixed it is now Heartland Bank that has the lowest rates on offer . <p> Few people take out four and five year fixed rates so these comparisons make little impact , but for the record it is ICBC and Westpac with the current lowest . <p> For the popular one year fixed rate you give up only six basis points ( bps ) by taking a Kiwibank carded offer , but almost 50 bps by taking the ASB carded offer . <p> For the increasingly popular 18 month fixed offers , the lowest is 30 bps from the best main bank carded rate . <p> For two years fixed , going with the ' best ' main banks , ANZ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bps higher than Heartland Bank . <p> Obviously you should negotiate and shop around .

@@99496237 <p> Speaking in the Of Interest podcast , the London-based Donovan says profit-led inflation , whereby companies are able to expand profit margins and convince customers it 's fair to do so , is the third wave of inflation experienced in developed economies since the Covid-19 pandemic . It follows a demand shock as developed country economies reopened and consumers had a " stockpile of savings " they spent on durable goods such as furniture , electronics and cars , and an energy supply shock after Russia invaded Ukraine , when energy prices surged and demand reduced . <p> " What it profit-led inflation has really done is prolong the inflation . If we had not had the war in Ukraine I do n't think we 'd have got the profit-led inflation because Ukraine has been an important part of the story that companies have told to convince people to accept higher prices . I think if we had n't had the war in Ukraine we would be sitting here talking about falling prices today , " Donovan says . <p> " Right now we 're starting to see profit-led inflation be challenged in a number of countries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about half of the inflation that we 've experienced over the last six-to-eight months .

That 's the critical story . " <p> In the podcast he also talks about how to spot profit-led inflation , consumers ' naive views about what causes inflation , why he does n't like the greedflation term , why central bankers should talk more about profit-led inflation , why it took off in the wake of Covid-19 , and the role of social media . <p> " Two things made profit-led inflation easier this time .

Therefore , we 're always going to be more expensive compared to other developed nations . <p> Shopping around will make a difference . But the costs we impose on ourselves in tax is still the biggest portion of what we pay , and that is even after the suspension of some of the tax .

CPI would have been 1.5 to 2 percentage points lower in 2021 if they had kept their margins at their previous ( very healthy ) levels . <p> The consultants ( Sense ) also decided not to use the level two business data , which is where you can separate out retail from accommodation / food . Obviously lower margin in accommodation / food ( no tourists ) offset the higher margins in retail . Again , seems rather convenient . <p> Amazes me that even this paper thin analysis shows that the contribution of imported input costs dominates our inflation story , with wages and profits responsible for a much lower ( and broadly equal ) share . Yet , we attempt to wrestle down prices by trying to make more people unemployed .

I remember an article by the Mobray family who pondered on buying their own ship , but suspected Unions on the US coast would be very slow to dock and unload it . <p> While no doubt there was probably profiteering going on , these ships generally stop at a few ports on their run . In normal times they 'd be in and out of a port within 48 hours . During Covid , each port could be upwards of 1 week . The Emma M ? rsk for example carries 13 crew with capacity up to 20 .

It is predicated on the belief that , in a perceived current breakdown of law and order , there is a new generation of gang member who does not fear the law . They are " young yelping pups , " who have set out through ram raids , truancy , and gang violence to destroy our " national qualities of industry , blood , sweat and tears " . <p> Moreover , these young people are " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crypto-fascist bit because that generally means people who keep their admiration for fascist ideology on the down-low . I do however admit that gang insignia bearing the swastika is a bit confusing . <h> Advertisement <p> Jones proposes that the police have become captured by the " woke " mania of tribalism and Tiriti victimology . <p> I 've always assumed that " woke " is a verb referring to some past tense of being awake . Being awake to what 's going on would seem to me to be a good thing . I 'm wrong . Woke is an adjective . It describes being aware and attentive to societal factors and issues . <p> Again , I consider that 's a good thing especially when honouring Te Tiriti , the agreement that binds us as a nation . In terms of perceived Maori privilege , Jones acknowledges that Maori are 42 per cent of all criminal apprehensions . Furthermore , he tells us that nigh on half of the male inmate population are " the nephs . They are the ones who need reprogramming - numeracy and literacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . <p> Corrections Te Ara Poutama Aotearoa are useless in the rehabilitation space . As Jones rightly says , the name thing does not matter as much as the quality of a thing . Nomenclature does not lead to superior outcomes . True brother , true . <p> Jones says the current administration is unwilling to bring the hammer down on crime . He says the axe needs to be swung , the police significantly " rebooted " and bolstered , and in a canine fashion , " let off the leash " so they can take robust action . <p> I think the 856 arrests and seizure of drugs and firearms during Operation Tauwhiro , the hundreds arrested for ram raids , the application of new policing powers that had been requested to deal with inter-gang conflict , and last week 's efforts in Operation Pakari in the South Island , demonstrate that the Police are currently very robust . What would a reboot look like ? <p> Jones favours making gang membership an aggravating factor in offending and tilting sentencing guidelines " in favour of community safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imprisonment . He understands that imprisonment does not guarantee rehabilitation -- indeed , on the contrary we have a 60% rate of recidivism and prison is the major recruitment channel for gangs . <p> Jones suggests the trade-off is that whilst an individual is incarcerated it does spare the community from " further intimidation and violence " . <h> Advertisement <p> Considering the factors of gang recruitment and recidivism , does increasing the prison population seem the best way forward to build community resilience leading to community safety ? <p> Jones is perceptive . He understands that " deterrence is both an invisible boundary and a linkage . It supports the soft infrastructure underlying a community " . Yes . Yes . If Jones understands that then it seems illogical to me , in reference to the Mayor of Opotiki 's calm rational response to the political and media storm visited upon his community during a citizen 's tangi , that he would describe the mayor 's efforts " odious and misguided " . <p> To my observations the mayor was clearly demonstrating his understanding of the complexities of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintain coherence and resilience of that community . <p> Flip the script . If in power and the same occurrence as Opotiki was in the North how well would Jones and matua Winston manage things ? It may not go so well . <p> Jones reckons a gang member is effectively a domestic terrorist . NZ First Policy is that the Terrorism Suppression Act would be amended , and a patched gang member declared a terrorist , and would thus forfeit the rights of citizenship . <p> Well , if you want to breed terrorism there 's foreign players willing to help . <h> Advertisement <p> We are surely under attack through misinformation and disinformation . We also face a form of chemical warfare . Whilst gang numbers may have doubled in the last year the amount of methamphetamine intercepted at our borders has increased by 4000 per cent . Say it again ? 4000 per cent . <p> To my observation that 's the pivot point of our trouble . <p> If I was advising a community leader , say the mayor of Whananaki , in response to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward in dealing with gangs at a community level , I would suggest a strategy based on the ideas of counter-terrorism expert Peter Lentini . <p> Lentini would advise : Avoid the temptation to politicise the gang issue , and to offer " silver bullet " solutions through piecemeal legislation ; Do n't deal with public fear , by promoting public fear -- take a rational long-term approach to the issue ; Seek to understand issues of causation -- and address them ; Understand that while some gang members are dangerous criminals , not all members of gang families are criminals , or condone criminal behaviour ; Absolutely engage with pro social leaders within gangs . <p> And to my reading , Lentini 's suggested response framework seems to me to be like that currently being pursued by the NZ Police .

Hundreds of job cuts have been proposed , and that means courses are going too . Here 's the latest on which are set to be culled . <p> As Victoria University of Wellington and the University of Otago seek to fill theirbudget holes , staff have been presented with financial plans proposing mass job cuts and the cull of entire programmes of study . The Spinoff has been through them to bring you this list of all the programmes at risk . Note that these are proposals in various stages ; accurate as of June 22 , but may not be a complete list as the situation changes . <h> Te Herenga Waka/Victoria University of Wellington <p> According to documents shown in yesterday 's presentation to staff by VUW vice chancellor Nic Smith , the university is proposing to disestablish 275 roles ( both academic and non-academic ) and create 46 new roles ; a total reduction of 229 FTE ( full-time equivalent ) roles . Forty-nine of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the faculty of humanities and social sciences , nearly a quarter of their workforce . The school of business and government is also losing 33 roles . Based on this presentation , conversations with Tertiary Education Union ( TEU ) representative Dougal McNeill and other reporting , below are the programmes in the crosshairs . <p> The cuts are aiming to create $10m of operational savings each year . The full change proposal will be published on Monday ; staff can make submissions until July 31 and final decisions will be announced on August 14 after a period of consultation .

" There 's no particular student downturn , " Otago TEU co-chair Craig Marshall told The Spinoff . Student numbers have reduced by only 0.9% , but the university was expecting growth of 4.9% . So far , the only confirmed job losses are in a proposal to significantly slim the languages and cultures department ; other areas have been asked for voluntary redundancies , which may impact which courses can be offered . The university has not made a full proposal of which areas may be targeted ; Marshall said he expected staff would hear of the initial plan for voluntary redundancy next week , while other changes will be confirmed after a consultation period . <p> Administrative changes ( degree no longer offered but no job losses ; students can complete their courses ) <h> More Reading <p> The bachelor of applied science will be absorbed into the bachelor of science .

It 's not clear if academic jobs will be next as the institution seeks to counter its deficit . Te Pukenga , the national polytech , is losing more than 400 jobs , mostly in management , out of its approximately 10,000 staff ; a student writing for The Spinoff earlier this week said tutors are resigning regularly . The polytech has some significant challenges as part of its ongoing merger , and academic jobs may soon be threatened too . AUT , which planned to cut 170 jobs last year citing declining enrolment , including of international students , announced in February that its redundancy plan was on pause for at least six months . 
@@99618236 <h> Every song in the Kiri &amp; Lou universe , ranked <p> What is the number one most especially special song in the Kiri &amp; Lou universe ? ( Image : Supplied ) <p> One family takes on the elephant-sized task of ranking all 70 songs in the beloved kids ' show and lives to tell the tale . <p> Kiri &amp; Lou is a Bafta-nominated , other-award-winning , locally made kids ' claymation show starring prehistoric creatures living in a dense and unpeopled Aotearoa forest . The creator and writer is Harry Sinclair , which goes to show , if you did n't think so already , that he 's actually a genius . Kiri is voiced by Liv Tennet , who could not be more perfect as headstrong , passionate , yellow tuatara-ish character , while Jemaine Clement is Lou -- a purple , elephant-esque creature with a heart of gold . The whole thing is warm without being saccharine and handles big ideas ( death , rage , disability , body positivity , the exhausting job of parenting ) with A+ storylines . <p> But the music ! The music is next level . Harry Sinclair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New Zealand 's best musicians and vocalists , have made mini classics for literally every episode . Which is what made this ranking so excruciatingly hard . It was the best of times and it was the worst of times . And it was absolute scenes when it got to the top three . <p> Methodology : A family effort between Andrew , musician ; Charlie ( 5 ) , target audience ; and me , a humble megafan . We assessed based on responses to the following questions : Can it withstand high rotation ? Does it evoke strong feelings ? Is it musically interesting to both the trained and untrained ear ? Are the lyrics especially special ? Background research : Links to YouTube provided for every entry . You can also listen to the soundtrack albums on Spotify . The show screens on TV2 , Prime , YouTube Kids and standard YouTube . <p> Shaaammmeeee ! Anyone else haunted by that cutting 90s whine ? The trio of singing birds ( who feature heavily from here on in ) shame out Kiri so hard : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roderick when he tried to hatch that rock . " <p> Fine , fine , fine . The melody is reminiscent of Life 's A Happy Song , the bubbly classic that Bret McKenzie wrote for The Muppets , which got us good and sidetracked . How incredible were some of those Muppets covers ( like this one and this one ) . And is Electric Mayhem the best band name in a fictional universe ? We decide that I am Janice , Charlie is Animal , Andrew is Dr Teeth . <p> The horn section is particularly effective , and the choreo is ripper -- easy to imagine a live stage version . Which would be so cool . Someone has to make a live stage version . Puppet Kiri and Lou , like The Muppets . Kermit and Lou would get along incredibly well and Kiri and Miss Piggy would have infamous scraps . <p> Actually fully resent this one for encouraging messy play which is living hell . " We can splish and we can splash and we can say hello to Bessy , but the bestest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fun lyrics , " fangles and dangles " especially . <p> We need a Sorry and Dalvanius spinoff please , Harry Sinclair ! This pair of little inventors with enviable talents ( hearing , speed ) make me want to book a family tramping adventure to the bush so we can listen and actually appreciate being cold and damp and surrounded by freaky insects , for once . Charlie actually stopped and listened to the raucous tui outside the other day : " like Dalvanius " . <p> Sorry ( left ) is voiced by Jaquie Brown and Dalvanius ( right ) is voiced by Josh Thomson . <p> I have a particularly strong emotional response to the few seconds in this song in which we see a weird little armadillo-ish thing in an underground den , hugging a tiny baby , joining in on this instrumental piece with a strange , tired-ass voice : a touching nod to the invisible impact of art and how parenting tiny babies can be lonely AF . <p> I could really have used this song when I came last in the cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is such a slap in the face . " There are many ways to go , go , go / Some go fast , fast , fast some go slow , slow , slow / I 'm springing , I 'm scuttling , I 'm jogging , I 'm bellowing , I 'm melting ! " <p> What begins as a light and silly song is stupendously hijacked by a " classically trained " kiwi-huia mash-up on BVs . Reminiscent of the Dolmio pasta sauce ads but way better . The voice behind the bird is John Moore , an illustrious opera singer Harry Sinclair met in border quarantine , in the exercise yard . So thank you , Covid , for that . <p> There 's a character called **28;1162;TOOLONG and they are a poet and they recite poetry for their friends . Lou ruins their performance with this song about losing your shit after hooning sugar cane : <p> Best line is a toss-up between " If you knock on my tree , all the lights are on but you wo n't find me , there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ galoot , everything is out of focus and my behaviour is atrocious but I could n't give a hoot . " Clement 's vocal comedic embellishments are spot on . <p> There was just nothing that touched the quality of this show when I was a kid ( apart from The Muppets ) . Long discussion between parents about that time one of the toys on Play School got melted in the microwave . WTF was that ? <p> Death is so hard to explain . Now you do n't have to : just whack on this episode and let the dinos do it for you . The slow , ritualistic tune is weighty and magical and introduces the concept of ageing out of this world without angst or tears or devastation . <p> Has there ever been a more empathetic character than the stressed out , eye-bagged , under-slept pterodactyl-ish dad on Kiri &amp; Lou ? The poor guy is just trying to have a moment singing a plaintive ballad ( with a killer opening that rips your heart right open ) but is interrupted with rude interjections about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had wings , I 'd regurgitate some fruit for you to chew " <p> Rude bird : " Who wrote this ? " <p> In the end he has to explain that " Some of my favourite songs were n't written by birds . " We 've all been there . <p> When you 're exhausted from regurgitating food for your chicks and you 're trying to have a sing and some rude bastard ruins it . <p> Deceptively simple . At first it 's reminiscent of a nursery rhyme , the kind you sing in rounds like Fr ? re Jacques . But when Kiri gets angry at a trio of sweet little strangers for sitting on her pet rock ( Rockaroonie ) she has a terrible moment of self-realisation , that that is who she is . We are n't left to dwell there though and neither is Kiri : within seconds the song turns into a rousing , many-voiced chorus , all singing : " Who are they , they are us , all of us , we are us , every day " layered with " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , every day " and " I am me , and you are you , but we are always us it 's true " . <p> Clement as Lou channels the cadence of Bob Dylan at the top of this jolly number that asks a classic question about the nature of time : " How did we get to right now ? / How did we make it here ? / Alive and well ? / I have no idea ? / But now 's the place to be . " Fucking poetry . <p> How great is it when the opening credits get a new treatment though ? Not quite at the level of The Simpsons ' Treehouses of Horror , but definitely spookier to the point of piquing Charlie 's gothic side . Highlight for the parents : Pania 's 1920s-style ballad , which reminds us of this slick Bryan Ferry album . <p> Jubilant AF , war-timey feel . Singing against dark , dancing in the face of horror . Love the horn section , love the cheesy shot of the creatures piling into the frame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Can see Lea Michele taking this to Broadway . This is when I realised that Liv Tennet is an impeccable performer : she manages to convey that Kiri is secretly delighted at the potential drama of maybe being stuck in a tree forever.23 Mother Earth from ' Mother Earth ' ( S2 ) <p> We have quite a lot of conversations about how there 's literally no other planet for us even though the universe is infinite . Unexpectedly emotional given the current context . Sample of lyrics : " Mother Earth , I want to smell your flowers / Mother Earth , for hours and hours and hours and hours / Mother Earth please let me stay by your side each night and day / Mother Earth please hear my plea there 's nowhere else I 'd rather be . " <p> Look , to be fair this song is all me . The others had no feelings . I just love Small . She 's a TINY ARTIST in a TREE APARTMENT and in this song she 's surrounded by her wild canvases that convey her relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art . For Christ 's sake ! The style is Andrew Lloyd Webber meets folky pop with choral harmonies . Tears to these square , square eyes . <p> Selection of lyrics ( take note , Creative New Zealand ) <p> " If the storytellers called it a day one night ? " <p> " If the singers all stopped singing , what about them ? " <p> " In the morning would the sun still rise again ? " <p> Who do we have to campaign for a Small spinoff and some Small merch ? <p> Small in her apartment with her art . Look at her , just look at how cute and earnest . <p> To me Lou 's trunk symbolises the savage beast in all of us , particularly when you 're hungry and you 're a kid and the world is full of adults inexplicably making you eat with your mouth shut and use cutlery . We debated what a something something would taste like ( we landed on carrot x tomato x banana mashup ) and then had to explain that they are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . Anyway , the gist is that when Lou 's trunk finds a huge something something when the rest of him is asleep , Kiri is desperate to eat it . She sings a " quiet song " with strategic LOUD BITS in an attempt to wake him up kind of but not really , but really . <p> Big hit with the child who participates in the LOUD BITS with enthusiasm and if he 'd got his way this song would be waaayyy higher . But the LOUD BITS give me a headache and lead me to question my decision-making and my wisdom in undertaking this task , even though I was the one who suggested it . Also note that by this point I 'm not sleeping because the entire song list is playing through my head at 2am . Charlie has given up because Yum Yum Baronies is n't the singular and only song on the list and what even is a RANKING , and Andrew has gone down a musical rabbit hole involving jazz and the Phoenix Foundation . I 've never felt so close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kiri goes to town with minor falls and major lifts , wallowing gloriously in her sad feelings . " Oh wo n't you sing along with the world 's saddest song ? " Yes , yes we will because it 's a vehicle for the monstrous drama queen in all of us . <p> Charlie is scarily good at this song . He can say Shama 's whole name after only a couple of listens . The rest of us struggle hopelessly . When do you lose the ability to respond effectively to instruction in song form ? This episode is also the best expression of realising ableism I 've seen : Kiri and Lou learn not to assume on face value that everyone needs their pity or help . <p> I think the trajectory of the entire world would be different if this show had been around in the 90s . Another beautifully body-positive anthem in which the animals celebrate shy ( literally , he disappears ) Dalvanius 's amazing ears . <p> A hugely relatable song about food panic . Lou 's ditty is an attempt to pep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repetitive and melodic and features two of the best characters on the show , Hemi and Lemi , rainbow snails with exceptional aesthetic taste . " You have to be polite yes you do , you must try with all your might yes it 's true / If there 's any way you canners you must try and use your manners / Oh you have to be polite , yes you do . " Highlight : Hemi and Lemi 's synchronised choreo . <p> For weeks I walked around humming this tune thinking " A country classic . To what angel of the canteen does that vinegary , wry voice belong ? ! " and it 's only bloody legendary Aussie folk artist Paul Kelly . Filthy saxophone solo too . Chef 's kiss . ( Additional note : Please can we have a Julia Jacklin cameo next ? ) <p> You 'll find yourself singing this assertive anthem all day and it wo n't even annoy you or anyone else . The song elevates a powerful episode in which Kiri tells morose Ictheo ( axolotl-like creature ) that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and water . An essential message for all ages all wrapped up in a super-catchy tune : " I love to give my body , the best things all the time , some um yum baronies , running and swinging on vines . My body belongs to me , my body belongs to me , it 's the one I 've got and I like it a lot , my body belongs to me . " Praise be . <p> The trio of tuneful birds ( Don McGlashan ) are the cherry on the top of Kiri &amp; Lou 's world and this is their best solo . It 's lilting , it 's gentle , it makes you sing about trying not to shit on your mates . <p> I defy anyone not to break the hell down in an attempt to emulate the way Jemaine Clement manages to load Lou with gentle , tentative yet balls-out bravery in this lilting masterpiece about talking , not hitting . <p> The first cut is the deepest . This is the first-ever Kiri &amp; Lou tune in the first-ever episode and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song about eating Baronies ( fruits that look like persimmons which can cause havoc in the supermarket come the season for those flavourless ginger baubles ) to be at number one . But in the words of Bandit from Bluey , " kids are silly " . <p> DJ , play my favourite song ! Small ( miniature walrus-esque creature , and artist , who lives in a tree apartment and who can be seen creeping around in the background most episodes ) owns in this dance-tastic , festival-friendly power tune that would get your hippy aunty out of her house truck as well as the version of yourself that swears on Fraggle Rock that you were , pretty much , in the moshpit for Rage Against the Machine at the Big Day Out in 1996 . <p> Do a little jump is mad , it 's energetic , it 's infectious and it features one of New Zealand 's greatest percussion artists : Chris O'Connor . The music is so catchy that you ca n't help but do what tiny-but-mighty Small tells you to do : " do a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jump ! " We have used this song at home , many times , as a mood refresher on grey days and sunny ones alike . The percussive layers build and build , creating a foundation of action that your tired old body , and the child 's screen-zonked brain , ca n't help but respond to . <p> It 's also a surprising song : it shifts in tone in weird and hilarious ways : " Do a little wiggle , then another little wiggle , then stand very still and say ' I beg your pardon ? ' " <p> If you join Small and his long-suffering tiny friend then in no time you 'll be puffing and laughing and you 'll feel like a kid again . And that is TV magic . <p> Tuck me up and put me to bed with this song in my ears . It 's a perfect world of tone , lyric and voice coming together to make something that transcends a prehistoric claymation universe . <p> In this episode , Kiri gets extremely pissed at Lou 's calm inner voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not a dinosaur . She runs off into a dark and spooky cave and there the friends are stuck waiting to be rescued . Lo and behold they encounter the delicate magic of glow worms for the first time and Julia Deans begins to sing:There 's a little bit of light inside us all <p> Just a faint little light so very small <p> But when one by one our lights all come on <p> Bit by bit the darkness is gone . <p> What can your little light do , all on its own ? <p> When the darkness all around , makes you feel so alone ? <p> But if you take the hand that 's right next to you <p> Every spark in the dark will come shining through . <p> Shine your light , show the way <p> For anyone who 's lost and anyone who 's astray . <p> CUE WEEPING . <p> I think what makes this song so incredibly beautiful is the soaring vocals and the bop-bop-ooo-ooo backing vocals which give the whole tune a gospel feel . It 's reverent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' voice is showcased to the fullest : all rock'n'roll edges and unwavering strength .

@@99618237 <h> Meet the woman putting culture at the heart of urban planning <p> Professor Michelle Thompson-Fawcett has focused her career on extending the decolonisation conversation into the processes of urban planning . Now , she 's been appointed to Poutoko Taiea at the University of Otago . <p> Entwining Indigenous knowledge , histories , values , and presence into the settler-colonial cities of Aotearoa New Zealand is at the heart of what Professor Michelle Thompson-Fawcett ( Ngati Whatua ) does . It was her early life in South and Central Auckland , particularly events surrounding Takaparawhau , and the 506-day occupation of land overlooking Auckland 's Waitemata Harbour in the late 1970s , that laid the foundation for her career . <p> " I was a school child living less than 2km away from all this activity as it took place . It epitomised the fraught , enduring , haunting history of the land around the Orakei/Okahu Bay area , telling a damning story about how the ' City of Auckland ' was fashioned , and has been reproduced ever since , " says Thompson-Fawcett . <p> " It seemed to me that the ongoing politics of place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the most important issues you could seek to unveil and repair in our society , " Thompson-Fawcett says . <p> Exposure to this large-scale Indigenous-led protest movement in New Zealand 's largest city grew Thompson-Fawcett 's understanding of the importance of place in the maintenance of Maori identity in urban areas . Revealing the power relations evident in the practices surrounding design and space , and then envisioning transformation that facilitates Maori aspirations of decolonisation and tino rangatiratanga in this space is what she 's dedicated her time to since . <p> " For me , Indigenous-led urban planning and development means working towards a built environment that activates Indigenous knowledge and practices , acknowledges the unique histories and presence of Indigenous peoples in locations that are now urban spaces , and respects the relationships between people , land , and communities , " she says . <p> Silo Park on Auckland 's Waterfront ( Photo : Supplied ) <p> Today , Indigenous futurity is at the heart of Thompson-Fawcett 's work . Keeping herself busy , the professor in the School of Geography is also currently the associate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and leader of the Nga Pae o te Maramatanga " Toitu he Kainga : Healthy Environmental Relationships in Urban Settings " research programme . <p> " The built environment is not just about physical spaces , it 's also about cultural spaces , and we need to create places that allow for the expression of Maori culture , " Thompson-Fawcett says " for example , urban environments that enable our rangatahi to speak their language , practise their tikanga , and be Maori in the city . " <p> Acknowledging the troubled past and present of Aotearoa New Zealand , Thompson-Fawcett believes that Indigenous-led urban planning and design has the potential to play a part in healing that trauma by honouring Indigenous identities , explaining : " I 'm talking about embracing Indigenous aspirations from the past , present and future , and really envisioning how we can create opportunities that celebrate Indigenous cultures and histories , and weave them into the fabric of our cities . " <p> Recent work by Indigenous designers and planners has been delivering places in urban areas " where Indigenous people can see themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she says . The Tamaki Makaurau Auckland rail system is one example . The redevelopment of the City 's railway stations incorporates te ao Maori in the design . Using culturally significant , locationally-specific themes connected to movement by waka , navigation via stars , the flow of waterways , local volcanic maunga and more , the new development reflects the journey of those travelling through the city . <p> Another example is the progress taking place in the city of Otautahi Christchurch , in response to post-earthquake reconstruction of the central area . The redevelopment of Te Papa Otakaro/the Avon River Precinct demonstrates the centrality of the river to both Maori and subsequent settlers . Building on the Indigenous values of the river as a food source has been a major focus . A reinvigorated two kilometre stretch of the waterway and its banks now incorporates an integrated cultural narrative along this shared public space . <p> " Such achievements signpost the many ways that the wellbeing of Indigenous peoples in colonised locations might be envisaged as part of urban design , planning , decision-taking and governance processes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as advocacy , and her role as poutoko taiea at the University of Otago allows her to work with students who are up and coming urban and planning professionals and leaders .

She stresses the need for urban and planning professionals to understand the history of colonisation in Aotearoa New Zealand and recognise the critical importance of the role of tangata whenua in decision-making processes . <p> " When you 're teaching students who are going to be city makers , it 's really important that they understand the context of Aotearoa , they understand the histories of colonisation , and they understand the importance of working in partnership with Maori and having a really strong , committed and ethical practice around that , " she says . <p> Thompson-Fawcett 's work has made significant contributions to indigenous-led urban planning and decolonisation in Aotearoa New Zealand .

Two of his three wives -- Sarah Potts and Roimata Ngatai -- died in tragic circumstances , his girlfriend Pania murdered his best mate , and one time Leanne pashed him in the hospital car park . He 's starred in Air New Zealand video aimed at homesick New Zealanders , and one loyal fan even named their baby after him . <p> But after last week 's shooting drama in the hospital , TK 's life now hangs in the balance . He may be the show 's second-longest running character ( surpassed by the one and only Dr Chris Warner ) , but TK has found himself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TK on life support with Chris announcing that nothing more could be done , as TK 's wife CeCe realised that she must let her beloved husband rest in peace . <p> Is TK really about to cark it , or is Shortland Street playing with our fragile heartstrings once again ? The man has stared death in the face countless times during the past 17 years , beating prostate cancer , almost dying in the Ferndale wildfires and even surviving a boxing match against Hone Ropata . Surely these near-misses mean TK has built a healthy level of immunity against death 's bony fingers ... right ? <p> Let 's put on our white coats and check the medical evidence before us . <h> TK was shot <p> CeCe , TK and the bullet <p> People do n't usually survive shootings on Shortland Street -- just ask Wendy Cooper . Hang on , you ca n't , she 's dead . TK should have left Shortland Street when he had the chance , but instead he decided to play the hero , running towards trouble as bravery oozed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not bounce off the way the 2014 Christmas strip episode suggests it should have . Fate is a cruel mistress . <h> He 's now on life support <p> An extensive medical career based on 31 years watching Shortland Street and a lifetime secondment to a 24/7 drop-in centre called " Dr Google " tells me this is not a good sign . TK is not breathing for himself and his organs are failing . He ca n't even roll his own T-shirt sleeves up . Prognosis : grim . <h> They 're about to turn off the life support <p> Not good <p> Causes of death on Shortland Street include faulty heart valves , strangulation , falling off a cliff and being beaten to death with a candlestick . So far , nobody is listed as dying from " someone pushing the off button " , so this could be an historic way for TK to go . Having found TK 's advanced directive that he never wants to be on life support , Chris has little choice but to let his pal die . All he can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Anchor Me ' as the golden light of Ferndale 's setting sun rests upon TK 's furrowed brow for the final time . <h> Shortland Street is having it 's biggest year yet <p> You must always look for the hidden meanings <p> Nothing says " big year " like knocking off one of the show 's biggest stars , right when the character is at their happiest . It 's one of the oldest tricks in the book , and we should have seen it coming as soon as TK announced he was doing " one last shift in ED " before he started his flash new job . One ! Last ! Shift ! Be careful what you wish for . <h> His dead wives turned up <p> I hereby call this meeting of the Dead Wives Club to order <p> You only see dead people on Shortland Street when someone is destined for the great operating theatre in the sky ( Damo getting hit by a bus ) or when a classic actor is returning in a new role ( Carmen , never forget ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biggest sign yet that something big is going on . How often do people get a day pass from the afterlife ? Almost never , mates . Ironically , the dead wives look well . How well ? We 're about to find out tonight . <p> Shortland Street screens on TVNZ 2 on weeknights and streams on TVNZ+. 
@@99618239 <h> Review : Homebound 3.0 is the TV romcom we 've been waiting for <p> " Auckland , New Zealand . Ever wonder how many 30-year-olds are still living at home these days ? " <p> So begins the narration of new local sitcom Homebound 3.0 . The series follows down-on-his-luck Henry Li ( played by creator and writer Sam Wang ) , an aspiring writer who lives at home with his parents while he tries to get his career off the ground . " Loser , " the narrator gleefully declares as Henry clacks away at his laptop in a dark room . Later , we discover the narrator is Melissa Wu ( Michelle Ang ) , a 30-something dermatologist who also lives with her parents . <p> As a condition of living at home , both Henry and Melissa are being subject to " family Tinder " , a matchmaking service run by Aunty Linda ( Helene Wong ) , the " number one matchmaker " in the Chinese community . Brash , bold and unapologetic , Melissa has gotten herself banned from Aunty Linda 's matchmaking service . Although Melissa herself is unfazed , her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back into the family Tinder group chat . <p> Meet the Parents is quaking . ( Image : Supplied ) <p> Meanwhile , Henry , still reeling over his break-up with successful sci-fi author Yang Yang , has gone on 23 first dates with no luck . " ? ? ? , " Henry tells his parents . But without a second date , Henry faces being turfed out of home . To his friends Jen -- a divorced literary agent camping in her parents ' front yard -- and Aidan , it 's a no-brainer . Fake it . <p> And so begins Henry and Melissa 's tumultuous relationship . Although the premise is pretty standard romcom fare , Wang 's Chinese-New Zealand spin provides a fresh and engaging take on the genre , and the show is laugh-out-loud funny . From the larger-than-life personalities to the sparkly stage set of Aunty Linda 's eponymous restaurant , there 's a lot to love about Homebound 3.0 . A special mention must go to the fabulous costumes by Lani Perkis , including Vaughn and Mandy 's colourful LA garb and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal favourite quirks of the show is the way Wang 's script moves fluidly and convincingly between Mandarin , Cantonese and English . As a Chinese-New Zealander myself , there 's something touching about seeing our diverse linguistic heritage and community represented so consistently on screen . It was n't too long ago that my own family was being told to " speak English " at the supermarket . <p> And besides being a lovingly sardonic representation of the way mine and many other New Zealand families communicate , Wang 's dialogue is also genuinely funny . Of course , it helps that the cast 's delivery is so consistently fantastic . Special shout-out to actors Patrick Leung and Xiao Hu , and Gabriel Chao Ren and Irene Siu , who play Henry and Melissa 's parents respectively , as well as Helene Wong ( of Being Chinese fame ) as the hilarious Aunty Linda . <p> " Why are you looking at that ? ! ? ? , do you want me to die ? " yells Mrs Li as Henry struggles to get his porn off his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has particularly apt comedic timing , and I find myself missing the Lis and Wus when they 're not on-screen . <p> Michelle Ang in Homebound 3.0 . Image : Supplied <p> Michelle Ang is also fantastic as Melissa Wu , who you find yourself rooting for despite her bad attitude . Between Wang 's script and Ang 's performance , we get the sense that behind her fun , messy exterior Melissa is desperately trying to escape herself , and the moments where we see her drop her guard are so much more impactful because of it . Besides , Melissa 's don't-give-a-fuck exterior and wilfully bad decision making ( which leads to increasingly high stakes for Henry and the team ) are somehow endearing . From quietly celebrating her sister 's bad news , to her obsession with popping pimples and quiet eye-rolls , Ang consistently steals every scene . <p> And although I find Henry 's struggling novelist backstory largely unsympathetic , Wang still manages to make him a likeable lead . Ultimately , both Henry and Melissa want their parents ' approval , and will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a motivation that speaks to almost everyone . Like any good romcom , Homebound 3.0 has a solid emotional core to hang its hat on . It 's funny and it 's silly , but it 's also heartfelt and honest . <p> Undoubtedly the full eight episodes will have plenty more delightful moments in store for us and I , for one , ca n't wait to see how Wang plans on topping Henry 's love-rap about chicken feet .

" I had glasses . I was really overweight . I had big , bouffy hair . I 'd put my feet over my head , and draw all the time , " she says . <p> " Yeah , I was just a weirdo . I was begging to get bullied . So , obviously , I got bullied by everyone . The South Asians , the white people , the people of colour . I was really into anime and fantasy because real life was so depressing . <p> " But this is the thing , I never felt ashamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just being kind of weird . And I do n't know ... I have a bit of an ego . I was like , ' They 're the problem . ' " <p> Then , in Year 9 , Singh gave an " inappropriate " speech about mum jokes that made everyone laugh . That earned her some street cred . Humour became her defence mechanism , as it often does for smart , misfit kids . By the time she left school , she was the undisputed queen of slay comebacks . All the bullies had dropped out by then , anyway , and her struggle for acceptance was playing out closer to home . <p> Singh had picked up drama in Year 12 without telling her parents , who would n't let her study art or apply for film school . Comedian Pax Assadi , a fellow first-gen Kiwi whose Iranian father and Pakistani mother came to New Zealand as refugees , went to the same high school and has a similar backstory . When Assadi told his parents he was going to be a stand-up comedian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adult , that my family sacrificed everything and wanted me to have a stable life , but as a teenager , you 're like , ' Screw you , Mom !

He did n't pave the way for me at all . But the people I met through drama and the fact that I got to be on stage -- to be someone else -- was life-changing for me . " <h> Advertisement <p> Now 27 , with a background in producing and a master 's degree in screenwriting she completed in lockdown , Singh is about to open her first play , Basmati Bitch , at Auckland 's Q Theatre .

" It 's a kind of a power fantasy for South Asian women , " she says . " For all women , really . It feels good to be bad , sometimes . It feels really f***ing good . " <p> The story 's setting is a neon-lit , dystopian future beyond the tipping point for climate change . Global trade wars have created a black market for rice and New Zealand -- plagued by constant monsoon-like rains -- is in the grip of a totalitarian government . <p> Despite some gritty underlying themes ( people smuggling , exploited migrant workers , the collapse of society ) , Basmati Bitch is a crime caper at heart , with choreographed stage combat and a pan-Asian ensemble cast playing multiple roles . Shiva and Bisma , the lead female characters , are flawed antiheroes . During early table reads , even the actors were shocked by some of the plot twists . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , with a shrug . " They 're not supposed to be good . " <p> The main action takes place in a shady bar called the Dragon 's Dojo , owned by a " basmati baron " , which doubles as an illegal fight club . Shiva is an MMA fighter with a dark past ; Bisma is a repressed office worker who gets turned on by seeing Shiva 's power unleashed . " It sort of unlocks this hunger in her , " explains Singh , who spent three years training at a Muay Thai boxing gym when she was at university and loved going to watch fights . <p> " Both Shiva and Bisma are misfits . Unapologetically misfits . I was always a misfit too , I guess , and I liked that . I never tried to fit in . I was obsessed with anime before it was cool .

' " <p> It was Karunaharan who gave Singh her first gig , convincing her to produce First World Problems , a platform he curated for emerging South Asian writers . Since then , they 've collaborated on a number of projects and Singh sees him as a mentor . But while much of Karunaharan 's work is about the past and the journey people have made to get here , he says Singh is constantly thinking about how to push the narrative forward .

Generally , Brussels sprouts are bought in another kind of coat ( plastic bags ) , rather than loosey-goosey and priced by the kilo . <p> For Countdown shoppers , that looks like either $6 for a 350g bag , or a much better deal of $5 for 500g if you can snag some Odd Bunch Brussels sprouts . At both Pak'nSave and New World , a 400g bag of whole fresh Brussels is $5.99 , while Supie offers a 400g bag for $4.50 . <h> How to make Brussels sprouts terrible <p> If you 'd like to disgust your family or put children off Brussels sprouts for the next decade , boil those buds until greyish , soft , waterlogged , sulfuric-smelling , and bitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sulphuric odour will arise -- but we all know boiling is the easiest way to ruin veg . <p> However , there 's more that can go wrong with a Brussels sprout than culinary disaster : as a rich source of vitamin K ( which is a blood-clotting factor ) , chowing down too heartily on the green buds can lead to adverse health effects for people on blood-thinners .

@@99784236 <h> Subscribe <h> Giving universities autonomy to slash and burn does not serve the national interest <p> Eroding the New Zealand School of Music at Victoria University with funding cuts would be a significant loss to Aotearoa , writes former school head Peter Walls . <p> Throughout the current crisis in funding for our universities ( Victoria and Otago particularly ) , the government has emphasised their autonomy . On June 2 , the prime minister insisted that " The universities make their own decisions about how they manage their finances " . In announcing a relief package on June 27 , finance minister Grant Robertson used virtually identical wording : " Tertiary institutions are autonomous and make their own decisions on how best to respond to their financial situation . " <p> In financial matters , this autonomy is illusory since the primary element in university revenue is government funding . The universities ' ability to recover costs through student fees is also limited by annual maximum fee movement rules that lock in , and over time amplify , the disparities that existed when the system was introduced . Essentially , financial autonomy exists only for expenditure -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the national interest . Meanwhile , a competitive model ensures that significant sums will necessarily be committed to marketing . This version of autonomy undermines quality education by inhibiting any overview of a particular disciplinary area . ( Medicine is a notable exception , given that the ambitions of both Victoria and Waikato to establish medical schools have so far been thwarted . ) <p> Music provides a great example of the way the autonomy to slash and burn does not serve the national interest . We await Victoria 's response to the new funding which amounts to $6m for two years ( less than 20% of the projected deficit ) . The vice chancellor ( whose predicament I do not envy ) has estimated that it might save a third of the positions scheduled for cutting . In other words , we still have a problem . <p> Under the original proposal , the New Zealand School of Music -- Te Koki at Victoria was to lose its director ( Professor Sally Jane Norman ) , one administrator , three academics from the composition programme , three from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter case , a professor and associate professor who both have stellar reputations internationally ( and who have attracted significant PBRF and Marsden funding ) . Even two thirds of this proposal would be devastating . Plans to develop the NZSM 's side of the National Music Centre ( touted by the Dominion Postas " the Juilliard of the Pacific " ) have been put on hold . ( Incidentally , back in the 1990s , a review of the School of Music called it " Juilliard on a shoestring " . I 'll come back to that . ) Across in the School of Languages and Culture , German and Italian would be disestablished . ( My doctoral supervisor in Oxford told me -- with good reason -- that I could n't expect to do advanced studies in western music without at least Italian , German and French . That is true -- and it applies even more obviously to those aiming for a career in opera . ) The proposed cuts seriously undermine the viability of the university 's school of music . That 's a significant loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Zealand . The autonomy of the university to take steps that are so damaging to advanced music education nationally seems wrong . <p> What does a music school that gives New Zealanders access to an education comparable with the best internationally look like ? First , it needs critical mass . The classical performance programme would have students in sufficient numbers ( and with the right balance of instruments ) to support quality orchestral and chamber music training . It must be located in a city with a major symphony orchestra -- a source of revelatory listening experiences , internationally-rated artist teachers , and a provider of early-career experience for the most talented . Singers , too , ca n't exist in a vacuum . They should be admitted in numbers and balances that make opera training possible . They need to be working alongside a piano department that includes collaborative pianists . Those intent on a solo career need to have the pace set for them by first-rate colleagues ( students and teachers ) . These students should benefit from having jazz , world music and popular music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at least in terms of their listening experiences , they are not confined to a silo . <p> Photo : Getty Images <p> Such a performance programme is an asset to a composition department . Composers get to write for and hear the full array of what 's out there . Music studies ( musicology , analysis ) are vitally important in providing skills and context for performers and composers but , even more importantly , as a humanities subject . The inestimable value of studying rich material without the sometimes-distorting blinkers of a vocational outcome is enriching and empowering . A recent Oxford study concludes that , " Students , graduates and employers noted that the resilience and adaptability developed during a humanities degree is particularly useful during big changes in the labour market . " All of this is enhanced by embedding the school within a university that can provide access to languages , literature , history and the humanities in general . <p> That , for me , is what any kind of Juilliard -- a " Juilliard on a shoestring " will do -- might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported total revenue of US$182m and net assets of $1.6bn . ) There 's a more affordable model , three hours away . The Sydney Conservatorium has the student numbers , access to the excellent Sydney Symphony , and superb facilities that -- like the National Music Centre -- are an imaginative mix of heritage and new build . ( New Zealand students can enrol there and pay domestic fees . ) I have been a guest lecturer at the Juilliard , the Royal Academy of Music in London and the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland . In each of these institutions , all of the above apply , including a strong emphasis on musicology and musicological research . <p> The NZSM is so close to fitting the bill : a decades-long partnership with the NZSO providing artist-teachers of outstanding quality , a famously strong composition programme , excellent academic teaching and research -- and a pathway to excellent facilities . The problem is that , in 2023 , it is supposedly not paying its way . There 's no room here to get into the real cost of training musicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( In 2019 , the Juilliard posted an operating deficit of US$3.6m . ) Disestablishing positions would seriously compromise the present operation and threaten the vision for the National Music Centre . <h> More Reading <p> But -- here 's the important part -- Aotearoa New Zealand needs the NZSM to flourish . We should be alarmed at a system that treats this as a single university 's problem -- one that can be fixed only by undermining a school that offers talented New Zealand students an education comparable to what could expect offshore . <p> Where does autonomy get us ? Classical performance is taught at Auckland , Waikato , Canterbury and Otago universities . None of our music schools attain critical mass . With a population of under six million and a seriously diminished capability for quality music teaching at pre-tertiary level , that seems unsustainable . I write with great sadness , since I am currently enjoying guest teaching in Madeleine Pierard 's opera course at Waikato University ( a course made possible by generous philanthropy ) and recognise the excellent work being done by dedicated colleagues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds universities properly and keeps an eye on what each disciplinary area needs across the motu .

Let 's decide what kind of music schools we need and where to put them . Let 's give the right institutions the opportunity to build critical mass .

Then , earlier this week , it was revealed that another $17m has been added to the cost of the Thorndon Quay to Hutt Road section of the project , and the cost of the controversial Golden Mile project has risen from $78m in 2020 to $139.4m today .

@@99838237 <p> Broadcaster Jeremy Wells sits down with Steve Holloway and Seamus Marten from the Between Two Beers podcast to discuss life , family , the difficult teenage years , Hilary Barry , Mikey Havoc and the irony of replacing MikeHosking . <p> There are two versions of broadcaster Jeremy Wells - and the two are not easily reconciled . <p> Most prominent these days is the straight-faced , deadpan , mature version of the multi-media personality who beams into 500,000 living rooms at prime time every weeknight as co-host of TVNZ 's Seven Sharp , alongside Hilary Barry . <p> Here Wells can be found unironically presenting what - at least to anyone not addicted to terrestrial TV - is an often mild catalogue of trite , light , infotainment pitched primarily at an audience of middle-class over 50s , but pitched perfectly all the same . <p> Then there is the savagely funny , sardonic , smirking and faintly subversive Wells , who has a back catalogue of some of the most jaw-dropping , controversial and outrageous segments in the history of New Zealand television . <p> Even today this offbeat version of Wells can be found on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the preferred order in which you might want to bed the Black Caps ' seam bowling attack ( Lovely Trenty is first , by the way ) . <h> Advertisement <p> On Seven Sharp you 'll find Dr Jekyll-Wells doing soothing introductions to mindless tosh about how cold winter is feeling this year , the cost of dating , how some people look like other people , whether it is time to ditch open office spaces , or perhaps a discussion about the most used emojis . <p> Meanwhile the darker Mr Hyde-Wells can be found online satirically parodying exactly this sort of TV puffery in historic out-takes from his former Eating Media Lunch series , with infamous spoof reports , such as of Shrek being slaughtered . <p> Or the even more notorious detailed satirical report on the production of " Anal Mana " , the world 's first indigenous , historically-accurate , culturally-specific porn film , featuring " Maori actors , Maori dialogue and traditional Maori costumes " set in 1850 , if the Media Lunch intros could be believed . <p> Here Wells earnestly explained with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climax " is " a metaphor for the incipient biculturalism that was later to define the emergent New Zealand " . <p> This was so realistically done that years later , in his book The Hollow Men , investigative reporter Nicky Hager revealed from sourcing internal emails , that former Prime Minister John Key was among those who thought Anal Mana was a real film , funded by the New Zealand taxpayer . <p> On the latest edition of the Between Two Beers podcast , Wells spoke about his role in yet another broadcasting niche , the Alternative Commentary Collective , and how their ball-by-ball cricket commentary here was originally a parody - and that led to a wider , deeper reflection . <p> " I mean , it 's like most of the things I do , including what I do on Seven Sharp now , " Wells said . " It is a parody of someone doing it . You know , I 'm pretending to be someone . And that 's kind of how I have to do it ... I 'm not really a cricket commentator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm just someone pretending to be a television host . I 'm not really a radio host . It 's just all a parody of it of those people . " <p> Wells is very , very good at pretending . Essentially he is now a TV personality who can even parody a parody . <h> Advertisement <p> This parody genius hit peak form well in advance of taking on his role at Seven Sharp , Wells had already gained a huge cult following for his keen sense of satire , which included the " Like Mike " radio segments on Hauraki , in which he pitch-perfectly aped right-wing broadcaster Mike Hosking , both in vocal tone and boundary-pushing content . <p> It became so hard to tell the real Hosking apart from Wells that the Broadcasting Standards Authority started getting complaints about Like Mike . <p> So was it odd to have life imitate art and end up replacing Hosking in real life on Seven Sharp ? <p> " Hundred per cent , strangest thing in the world , " Wells said . " I took over his car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over his desk . <p> " This is the weirdest thing . I took over his locker in the TVNZ changing room and it still had his name on it . They had n't printed my name at this stage . <p> " And so I had Mike Hosking 's locker , doing his old job , definitely not driving his car , or his type of car , and inside his locker was a Kenny Rogers album on vinyl and a Bible . <p> " Those were the two things that he had left - nothing else , everything else had been cleaned out , no clothes , nothing else . But there was a Kenny Rogers album . Is that weird ? Is that on-brand ? We do n't even know , that 's maybe why he left ? " <h> The makings of ' Newsboy ' <p> In the 90s Wells rose to fame as " Newsboy " , reading the news on Mikey Havoc 's breakfast show on student radio station 95bFM , and 1997 the pair made the shift to TV , launching the MTV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was boundary-pushing in the extreme . <p> Wells : " I think our show was a reaction to what else was on and ... there were a lot of things that were very safe on New Zealand television in the late 90s . " <p> Alternative culture was quite strong at the time , with a significant difference between alternative and mainstream . <p> " We were very much in the alternative camp and you did n't see a lot of that on TV , where it was all pretty straight down the line , and heavily manufactured . So I think when we first started Havoc there was not a lot of weird stuff going on . <p> " And Mikey was a surrealist , you know , in the greatest sense of it . And so it was just really about Mike 's surreal brain and putting pictures to it . " <p> Havoc and Newsboy already had great chemistry from their radio days , and that blossomed into television anarchy . <p> They then hit the road for more free-wheeling late-night slots on TV , where their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an even more controversial " Gay Man 's Rock " episode . <p> " It just essentially evolved and it was allowed to evolve because there was no pressure . I mean , you could do whatever you want . " <p> Wells and Havoc solidified their alternative status by broadcasting a clip where someone appeared to nail their penis to a crucifix . <p> Mikey Havoc and Newsboy ( Jeremy Wells ) in 2001 . Photo / File <p> Wells : " They lit it on fire ... In those days what we were looking for was the worst thing possible . So the whole thing was like , ' what is the worst thing that we could do ? ' And that was right up there . But someone sent that in to us , because they obviously got the sensibility of the show . <p> " But I just remember thinking my brain process was very much what has never been done on TV before ? We must do it . That was kind of where we were at . " <p> However his most embarrassing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the art technology at the time - and visiting a brothel for Havoc coverage of the Prostitution Law Reform Act . <p> " Prostitution had been decriminalised in New Zealand . And so that was a topic . Let 's get our teeth into the topic du jour , which is this issue . Because nobody else would have been touching it ... <p> " I remember Mikey and I sitting down and saying here , what do we do ? And I remember saying , ' Well , one of us has to have sex with a prostitute ' ... <p> " So we have a brothel ... I went in with a cricket helmet with a handycam gaffer-taped to it . And Mikey was inside the live eye guiding me . <p> " We did a paper-rock-scissors before that , who was going to have sex with a prostitute ? And I do n't know whether I won or not , but it was me . <p> " And then Mikey was like , ' Is it gon na be okay , mate ? And it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the phone to my partner at the time , saying " Ah , yeah . I 've got to have sex with a prostitute ' , explaining to her . <p> " Anyway , I ended up going in there and I did n't actually have sex with her - I was kind of pretending ... So there I am doing that . And then I think I put up a picture of the Newstalk ZB radio line-up ... And I 've got a mic and the live eye who 's directing me , just giving me tips on what I should be doing , what I should n't be doing . <p> " And then , in the end , I think I ended up zooming into Murray Deaker 's face upon climax . " <p> But the greater embarrassment came from Wells ' mother , Lady Sheryl ( Duckie ) Wells - manager of the New Zealand netball team at the time and in camp before going to the World Championships - being talked into watching this episode . <p> " She never watched that show . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She knew that it was just best that she did n't watch it . <p> " But that night , the girls in the netball team - Bernice Mene was the person who said to my mum , come on Duckie , no , come on , Duckie , let 's watch Jeremy 's TV show . <p> " My mom 's like , ' No , no , it 's fine ' . And the girls are like , ' Nah , come on ' . Well , all of a sudden the entire New Zealand netball team - of all the days that they would choose to watch the Havoc show with my mum was that episode - were sitting down and watching that . <p> " Now can you imagine my mum , she 's watching me pretend to have sex with a sex worker ... And then the Murray Deaker thing at the end . She has never ever mentioned to me that she ever watched it , never told me the story . <p> " Bernice Mene was the one that told me the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , my poor mum , having to watch me do that . " <p> So when he looks back , is he proud of these many and varied Havoc and Newsboy escapades ? <p> " No . No , I 'm not . I do n't look back on things and go you know , ' I 'm particularly proud of this ' or ' particularly proud of that ' . I ca n't think of anything that I 'm particularly proud of . " <h> The joys of Late Night Big Breakfast <p> One of Wells ' favourite broadcast moments came from yet another boundary-pushing show with a chaotic fun environment , The Late Night Big Breakfast , with Leigh Hart and Jason Hoyte . <p> Here Mike The Mongolian Throat Singer gives a rendition of We Are The World which is so bad it forces everyone to break character and descend into tears of laughter . <p> " The reason that I 'm laughing so hard , at that Mongolian throat thing is because I saw Leigh break - and he never breaks . <p> " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like , what a great joy ... I 'm not sure about other people broadcasting , but that is why I do what I do - for those moments that are elevated , that are magic moments . <p> " They come from somewhere and they 're different . They 're different than when you 're hanging out with your friends because it 's being filmed ... those are the best moments of your life as a broadcaster . " <p> It 's tempting to suggest it might be nice to see more of such moments on the very straight-laced Seven Sharp . <p> But Wells acknowledges that while he reveals little of himself on Seven Sharp , he does bring a lot more personality to his breakfast radio gig with Hauraki . <p> " You 've got to bring bits of yourself , because essentially , nobody can see anything . <p> " All they 're hearing is what 's coming out of your brain ... So you are creating everything that comes out of your brain and someone else 's brain and , and whatever is created from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is about pictures . It 's not about words , the words accompany the pictures , but it 's mainly a visual thing . And you 're stimulated by what you say . <p> " And took me ages to work this out . But I mean , Country Calendar is a great example . Absolutely . You know , why is Country Calendar one of the most popular shows in New Zealand and has been for the last 50 years ? It 's pictures , the pictures are just stunning . I mean , yeah , I get the stories are interesting . But essentially , it 's the same rural story . " <p> While chemistry is important on Seven Sharp , the detail can be far more exacting on radio . <p> The Late Night Big Breakfast team of Jeremy Wells , Jason Hoyte and Leigh Hart conduct a disastrous interview with a psychic <p> " You can hide on television , whereas on radio , I do n't think you can hide in the same way ... With the way that you respond , the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reveals so much more about yourself . " <p> Wells has established great rapport with both his broadcast partners , Barry on TV and Matt Heath , his brilliant foil on radio , despite them being quite diverse talents . <p> Wells : " Chemistry is pretty much everything . And what is chemistry ? It 's a magic . It is this magic thing that happens . And you know , when it happens , and it 's actually if you really , if you 're totally honest about it , it is the reason why you broadcast . <p> " The magic is what you 're looking for all the time . And if you are open to the magic happening , then these moments happen . And I feel so good when it happens . <p> " And you know , when it 's not happening , you 're quite aware of it . I reckon you get better over time of spotting when it when it occurs - and when it does n't . " <p> In terms of his Seven Sharp chemistry with Barry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing her . <p> " I love Hilary , and she 's a wonderful person to work with , " Wells said . <p> " You have partnerships at certain times as a broadcaster , and it 's an interesting area , because most of the time , people are thrown together . <p> " And they 're not often even asked whether or not they should be thrown together . <p> " I think she was the first person that they wanted for that job ... She then suggested some people who she would n't mind working with . And I think I was one of those people . I think that 's the way it worked . " <h> The troublesome teenage years <p> But it was a different sort of chemistry that got Wells into serious trouble as a teenager . <p> After his parents found marijuana in his room , he was sent to board at Whanganui Collegiate - only to be expelled for supplying a recovering patient at a drug addiction institution with cannabis oil at the end of the year . <p> Wells had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the final school term did a community experience week at the NSAD drug treatment centre in Marton . And while there he thought he would treat himself with a cap of cannabis oil that he had acquired , having finished his exams . <p> But while waiting for an opportunity at night , one of the patients approached him saying he 'd heard he had drugs , and Wells found himself in a difficult situation <p> " He was reasonably coercive . And I did n't have the skills to negotiate my way through it , as well as I would have liked . <p> " I ended up giving it to him , which was a terrible idea and sounds like the worst thing in the world . <p> " In the end . I actually threw it on the ground and I said if you want to pick it up , that 's all good , because I felt like I did n't really have an option . And then he picked it up and swallowed it . " <p> The next day the patient was really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a sober facility - boy , do they stand out . " <p> Wells soon found himself in solitary confinement at Whanganui Collegiate while they went through his study , looking for drugs , and his parents arrived . <p> " My parents had said to me , before I left , ' this is your last chance ' , because before they sent me down to Whanganui , we 'd been having some problems . And then they said , ' if you muck this one up , that 's it , you 're not part of this family any more ' ... <p> " So at that point , when we walked out of the headmaster 's office , my parents were like , ' Oh well , we told you what we told you , and see you later ' , and they just drove off . " <p> Wells was left in Whanganui by himself , returning to solitary confinement at the sanitorium where he had been placed , getting meals bought to him like a prisoner before being put on the Northerner train back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And so that was it . For me , that was my expulsion . My parents were practising I guess what they thought was tough love back in those days . Pretty , pretty brutal manoeuvre by them , but I 've go to say , quite good . <p> " Because if that had n't happened , I think a whole lot of other things would have happened and it worked out quite well in the end . " <p> Nevertheless Wells also recalls the stigma of being expelled and how it preyed on his mind , while waiting for the train at Marton . <p> " I remember thinking , what do you do in this situation ? I thought , ' yeah , I think you 're meant to kill yourself ' . <p> " And I just thought , I think that 's what I 'm meant to do . That would be the honourable thing to do in this situation . You know , you 've brought such shame to your family . <p> " And luckily , luckily , I just did n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking back , there was a moment . I just would n't even have the guts to be able to do something like that , but it was definitely a thought that I had . " <p> Finally , we asked Wells , 46 this month , if he was a retire-early kind of guy ? <p> " My feelings on that change every day . Sometimes they change three or four times within that day . I do n't know , I think I 'll just kind of keep going and see what happens . <p> " The idea of retiring would be quite nice . What would be nice would be to have a sabbatical for like two months a year or something . To have more holidays would be nice but I do n't think that kind of works . <p> " If I was n't broadcasting - I think it 's kind of in me - I think I would be deeply unhappy . "

@@99926235 <h> How New Zealand can truly ' build back better ' <p> Slips and damaged houses in Karekare , West Auckland , in the wake of Cyclone Gabrielle Photo : RNZ / Finn Blackwell <p> Analysis - In the wake of Cyclone Gabrielle , New Zealand is again talking about " building back better " . But how do we build back better when we do n't necessarily understand what " better " means ? Or how to achieve this across a country with significantly different risk profiles ? <p> At its most basic level , build back better is an opportunity to rebuild homes and other buildings in a way that is responsive to future risks and sustainability needs . To achieve this , we need to address knowledge gaps around building within a circular economy . A circular economy is one that swaps the typical cycle of make , use , dispose in favour of reusing and recycling as much as possible . <p> A sustainable building in the circular economy model will minimise emissions and its impact on climate and natural resources across its entire life cycle . This life cycle includes the manufacturing of materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as end-of-life requirements ( deconstruction ) . <p> At the University of Waikato , our research is focused on material choices , both for long-term rebuild as well as immediate emergency relief . We approach this from a structural engineering perspective and consider light steel , light timber , fibre-reinforced polymers and concrete . We work alongside industry to develop know-how around deconstruction for light steel and timber structures . <p> The research will contribute to best practice guidelines and circular economy adaptation . Here 's why this is important . <p> But building back better is n't simply about using sustainable materials and construction methods , and incorporating features that enable lower emissions during the " living phase " of a home . <p> Buildings need end-of-life considerations built into the design and construction , so they can be easily repurposed or deconstructed with minimal energy and then recycled , reused or disposed of in a manner that does n't send emissions through the roof . <p> Presently , we 're building sustainable homes on the premise of being carbon neutral by 2050 , but they also need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end-of-life in 50 years . <p> We are not even close to achieving that . A report from building research institute BRANZ determined the climate impact of a new-build standalone house exceeds the 1.5C climate targets by a factor of 6.7 during its life cycle . This shows the substantial work needed to achieve carbon neutrality of new homes . <h> Modular buildings and new materials beckon <p> The solution to this issue may lie in modular homes and the development of new materials . <p> Quick and easy to make , modular homes provide fast options to house displaced people . They are also valuable for community wellbeing after the trauma of natural disasters . Finally , modular homes offer exciting opportunities for sustainability . They can be easily reconfigured to adapt to changing needs , for example , with the addition or removal of modules . <p> However , without careful design and know-how , modular homes and the foundations under them will not necessarily provide resilient and sustainable structures into the future . <p> Photo : <p> The most challenging aspect of modular homes is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's critical for resilient structures that the connections are designed carefully . Throughout the design process , those in charge need to consider the structure 's deconstruction or disassembly at the end of its life . <p> That said , modular homes are also not the cure all for the entire building industry . The global need for sustainable and resilient buildings is a driver for the development of new construction materials , such as the plasterboard substitutes saveBOARD and Neocrete , a low-emission concrete . <p> These products offer low-emission building options , which use recycled materials in manufacturing and provide an alternative to high-emission materials . But , due to a lack of strict regulations around adopting new materials and a lack of awareness in the industry , adoption has been slow . <h> Identifying the missing data <p> In New Zealand , we have different risk profiles across the regions , depending on the likelihood of earthquakes and natural hazards like flooding , landslides , and wildfires - as well as the intensification of those hazards due to climate change . <p> The location risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials , we need local testing data which are very limited as of yet . <p> If we 're really committed to building back better , then we need to do the research and incorporate the evidence into the building code , design standards and information for construction practitioners . <p> This could mean a " passport " for new materials based on local testing . The passport would incorporate details on the potential to recycle and reuse , a disassembly guide and a sustainability record ( in essence , an environmental declaration ) . <p> The adaptation of the circular economy approach to the " build back better " strategy for buildings will be essential in reducing the risk of future catastrophes , as well as the impacts on climate and natural resources . Setting up a clear guideline for this strategy will be a pivotal early step in helping the industry define and oversee its efforts towards these objectives , which are currently lacking . <p> * Krishanu Roy is a senior lecturer in engineering at the University of Waikato . <p> Wood is making a comeback as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high carbon materials like concrete and steel .

My readingsuggests research into the efficacy of protein powder for teens is missing , so it may be a waste of money . Do you agree ? <p> Answer : Protein-supplement use among adolescents often indicates deeper body-image issues . A recent US study worryingly found that teens who use protein supplements for muscle building are more likely to adopt dangerous muscle-building behaviours , and were 2-5 times more likely to use steroids in the future . So , your concerns about your teenage grandson 's use of protein supplements are warranted from a financial perspective as well as for his overall wellbeing . <p> Indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Active Living found concerns about muscularity often framed protein-supplement use among teenage boys . <p> Moreover , adolescent boys ' -- but not girls ' -- use of protein supplements was associated with risk factors for developing eating disorders .

A 2020 study published in BMC Pediatrics found 4.2% of Australian boys aged 14-16 were already using anabolic steroids to increase muscularity . Anabolic steroids can cause significant side effects and severe and even irreversible damage to body organs in the long term , so it 's worrying that teens are using these medications for body-image concerns . <p> Adult use of protein supplements for building muscle mass is backed by sound scientific research . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preference to supplements . But little research has been done on the safety and efficacy of the supplements for teens . The recommended daily protein intake for a teenage male is 0.99g of protein per kilo of body weight , which equates to about 65g/day ; for adolescent girls , it is 0.77g/kg or about 45g/day . However , when an individual exercises regularly , their protein needs increase to support the maintenance and growth of muscle as their body adapts to the training . <p> Sports Dietitians Australia recommends athletes aged 12-18 eat about 1.3-1.8g of protein per kilo of body weight daily . However , more is not always better ; exceeding these protein recommendations can cause health problems . For example , long-term consumption of a high-protein diet has been linked to loss of bone mass and kidney dysfunction among other things . <p> Athletes should spread their protein target by including a small serving of protein-rich foods at 3-5 eating occasions a day , as the most significant effect on muscle synthesis is the amount of protein eaten over 24 hours .

@@100588235 <p> It is almost a universal law that whenever someone anywhere in the world writes a review of a performance car , there legally has to be someone who pipes up in the comments to say " it would be better with a manual " , even if that is patently not the case . <p> The Better With a Manual brigade will put forward all the reasons in the world why they would buy this car immediately if it had a manual transmission , yet when a carmaker does make a car with a manual , they are almost entirely ignored by the buying public . <p> Ford dropped a manual option from the best-selling vehicle in New Zealand ( the Ranger ute ) because the uptake was tiny and even report that the percentage of manual sales of Mustangs are in the single digits annually . <h> Read More <p> So when Toyota New Zealand announced it was making the GR Supra available locally with a manual transmission , the excitement from the Better With a Manual brigade was palpable . So did they all rush out and buy it ? <p> It might surprise you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , as of my time with the manual Supra , registrations were still very firmly in the single digits . <p> When Toyota New Zealand announced it was making the GR Supra available locally with a manual transmission , the excitement from the Better With a Manual brigade was palpable . <p> Seems that putting your money where your mouth is not something they are interested in , which is a shame , because in the case of the Toyota Supra , they were very right indeed - the Supra is much , much better with a manual . <p> But that is not because it makes driving the car more involving ( which it does ) , rather it is the fact that it really does n't actually need a manual transmission at all . <p> Okay , so that does n't really make sense - what the Supra really does n't need in daily driving is more than about three gears . The flexibility and meaty torque from the 3.0-litre BMW twin-turbo inline six is so chunky and ever-present that changing gears is really only a necessity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then it will happily lug away in second if you are THAT lazy . <p> But , of course , the real purpose of that manual is the added driver engagement on a winding back road . And , luckily , it is utterly superb here too . <p> While it does n't have the slick , mechanical action of , say , a Mazda MX-5 manual ( but then , what does ? ) , the ZF transmission is quick and precise , but does retain a sense of ' rubberiness ' that BMW manuals have ( it is manufactured by ZF for BMW , but ' tuned ' by Toyota ... ) meaning it is n't quite as engagingly tactile as the other members of the GR family . <p> Even though the shift knob is still clearly a BMW unit , it does look less glaringly out of place than the automatic shifter . <p> The six-speeder retains the same gear ratios as the last-gen F87 BMW M2 and F80 M3 and it saves 17kg over the 8-speed automatic Supra , so you can justify having that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly redesign the centre console to create a bit more knuckle space , but that is really the only change to the Supra , meaning it retains the same somewhat inconsistent interior the is nice , but not great , with areas of cheap feeling plastics amid the otherwise higher quality materials . <p> And even though the shift knob is still clearly a BMW unit , it does look less glaringly out of place than the automatic shifter . <p> The manual Supra is actually a wonderful blend of the best of both worlds - almost as easy to drive as the auto at low speed around town due to its big spread of torque , it is even more engaging on the open road , albeit in a slightly distanced BMW way . <p> If you are after the fastest Supra , then this is n't it - the auto will hit 100km/h in 4.1 seconds , while the manual takes 4.4 - but if you are after the most satisfying one , then it 's the manual all the way . <p> There legally has to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be better with a manual ' <p> But there is one catch - while Toyota has priced the manual the same as the automatic , the fact that the manual is slightly less fuel efficient and has a higher CO2 output ( 9.9L/100km and 225g/km of CO2 versus 8.3 and 188 ) means that it cops a larger Clean Car fee - $4887.50 compared to the auto 's $2760 charge - so you will be paying a small premium for the joy of shifting for yourself . <h> Owner Reviews <p> Kilometres travelled More than 100,000 km Did you buy this car new or used ?

Proposed Plan Change 29 focuses on intensification , aiming to accommodate much of Whakatu Nelson 's future growth through redevelopment within existing urban areas rather than expanding into new greenfield sites . <p> Proposed Plan Change 29 is consistent with the Nelson Tasman Future Development Strategy which estimates 78% of Nelson 's growth is expected to occur through intensification and development on existing urban-zoned land . <p> As well as changes to help address Nelson 's existing housing challenges , the plan change proposes updates related to heritage and natural hazards . The proposed changes aim to provide more housing options , opportunities , and flexibility within Nelson 's existing urban areas , giving homeowners and developers more choice in how they build .

" The goal is to make housing more accessible and affordable by enabling more diversity in housing types . This reform tackles Nelson housing affordability at its root cause by recognising that we need to use our limited land more efficiently . <p> " We will be welcoming submissions from Nelsonians on this reform after the proposed Plan Change is notified . This will help us get the right rules in the right place . We need a mix of intensification and greenfield development .

For example , for each lot , the General Residential Zone permits up to three residential units with a height of eight metres ( two storeys ) , the Medium Density Residential Zone allows up to three units with a height of 12 metres ( three storeys ) , and the High Density Residential Zone permits up to three units with a height of up to 19.5 metres ( six storeys ) . In the proposed changes there is no minimum site area for lots that contain residential buildings , however there is a 200m ? minimum lot size for vacant lot subdivision . <p> Building and site design is important , and the plan change has rules around reducing shadow and ensuring penetration of sunlight , provision of outdoor spaces and onsite storage . <p> There are some well-evidenced benefits of intensification that our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central city area to continue to grow and form a strong focal point for retail , hospitality and culture .

Special assessments and designs by qualified professionals will be required for significant new developments to ensure safety from natural hazards . <p> In addition , PC29 addresses heritage conservation by updating heritage policies and rules to support sustainable and safety-related changes to heritage buildings , without requiring resource consent . <p> A new way to access our plans " Council has shifted to an electronic version of all of Nelson 's Plans , making it easier for people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Mandy Bishop , Group Manager Environmental Management . <p> " ePlan offers two distinct ways to explore our city 's plans , both as a comprehensive guidebook that can be read from cover to cover , or you can use the interactive map to focus on specific properties and areas of interest . <p> " We urge you to go and have a look at the ePlan and find out what 's proposed for your neighbourhood .

@@100816236 <h> Five key steps to take before signing a contract <p> The success of your business often depends on the strength of your relationship with your suppliers and distributors , so it makes sense to protect both your business and these relationships by entering into robust , fair commercial contracts with them . <p> However , as soon as you have signed an agreement , you are legally obligated to honour the terms , even if you are not across the detail . As a result , you could find yourself stuck with obligations that could negatively affect the usual operations of your business and its growth plans . This article outlines five key steps business owners should take before committing to a contract . <p> 1 . Confirm who is signing the business contract <p> Signing business contracts can be complicated , particularly where the other party has a sophisticated corporate structure , or associated entities . For this reason , it is essential to check that the party signing the contract is the party you intend to be in a contractual relationship with . <p> It is also worth noting that when it comes to signatories , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contract alone . However , if the company has more than one director , depending on the type of contract you are signing , two directors might be required to sign to ensure it is legally binding . <p> From a practical perspective , you should also double-check that your details and contact information are correct and up to date , as well as those of the other party , to ensure accurate communication during your contractual relationship . <p> 2 . Review the details of the contract <p> Distribution and supply contracts can often contain intricate details that are easy to overlook or dismiss . While it may be tempting to assume that the contract provided to you by the relevant counterparty reflects previous discussions you have had , it is crucial to take the time to carefully review the terms before signing . This is because the agreed commercial terms may not be accurately reflected in the drafting of the contract ( which typically goes into significantly more detail than your commercial discussions ) . <p> For example , if your business contract includes an agreed price , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an amount determined by your counterparty at their sole discretion ( without consulting you ) . <p> When reviewing the contract 's details , you should consider : <p> What each party is required to deliver under the contract . <p> Your rights and obligations . <p> The term and pricing of the contract . <p> Being across the details will ensure both parties have clear expectations about their obligations , and reduce the risk of future disputes . <p> 3 . Understand the term of the contract <p> Most business contracts have a start and end date . <p> Since your business must fulfil its obligations for the contract 's duration , this timeframe can impact your business ' long-term growth . For example , if you enter a long-term agreement with a manufacturer that is no longer large enough to meet your business ' needs , you might not be able to end the agreement early to switch to a more suitable manufacturer , which could ultimately affect your profitability . <p> By contrast , a contract with a shorter duration provides flexibility for both parties . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renewal that allow you to extend the term for further ( short ) terms if the relationship continues to suit your current business needs and growth trajectory , therefore benefiting from some certainty of tenure ( which is often the most attractive factor of a longer-term contract ) . <p> 4 . Check the dispute-resolution process <p> When signing the contract , your relationship with the counterparty is likely to be positive , and the expectation is that you will have a long , constructive working relationship . Unfortunately , this is not always the case , and disputes can arise in the ordinary course of business . So , it is essential to ensure both parties are clear on how you will resolve a dispute should one occur . <p> Contracts often include a clause that outlines the preferred dispute-resolution process between the parties . Dispute-resolution clauses vary ( often depending on the context of the relevant contract ) , but might specify a combination of processes , including : <p> Negotiation , where both parties meet to openly raise any concerns and negotiate a solution to the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties to identify common positions and help them to reach a resolution . <p> Arbitration , which is similar to mediation but is subject to formal rules and will result in a binding decision . <p> Ultimately , it is important to familiarise yourself with the clause and ensure you are comfortable that the outlined process is suitable to your business and the nature of the disputes you are likely to face . <p> 5 . Seek legal advice <p> Regardless of how well you know your business , have an experienced lawyer review the commercial contract before you sign . This becomes especially important for any long-term , high-value or key strategic agreements ( regardless of value ) . <p> Georgina Toomey is the NZ general manager and practice group leader at LegalVision . <p> Comments <p> Business Advice sponsored by <p> The world 's largest enterprises , service providers , and government organisations choose Fortinet to securely accelerate their digital journey .

@@100982233 <h> The Best Beauty Dupes Of 2023 , Recommended By A Makeup Artist <p> Luxury beauty products are coveted for a reason -- with the finish , colour pay-off , lasting power and often limited quantities driving their desirability . <p> But in most cases , designer beauty products come with designer price tags . While many of them are worthy of the splurge , restocking your entire makeup kit solelywith high-end options can get expensive . <p> This begs the question : in beauty land , does expensive always equal " best " ? The answer is quite complex , says freelance makeup artist Kath Gould , adding that while high-end beauty products are often produced by big beauty conglomerates which have the budgets to invest in research , development and safety , such companies also create more affordable products , too . <p> " There 's a lot of research and development that goes into luxury products , but that also has a trickle-down effect on other brands , " she says . " There are less expensive products on the market that are backed by big companies such as L'Oreal Paris , for example .

" <p> Enter beauty dupes -- the products which do a comparable job to their luxe counterparts but at a fraction of the price . Kath shares four of her favourite high-end makeup products and the best dupes that achieve a similar result -- from a poppy blush to dewy skin perfector . <h> What is a beauty dupe ? <p> " A dupe is literally translated as a duplicate -- but it 's more than that . It 's either a duplicate of something high-end ( meaning it 's less expensive ) or it can be a dupe of a product that 's been discontinued , " Kath says . <p> Selecting makeup dupes from affordable beauty brands that promise similar results to the pricier original is likely to save you a small fortune , no doubt something we 're all keen to do given our current economic climate . <p> " We are in a recession at the moment , things are n't always as affordable .

Often , it 's the products that go viral on social media platforms like TikTok , making them more difficult to find . <p> " Products which go viral on TikTok become unavailable , which means people start looking for alternatives , " she says . <h> Do dupes generally perform as well as the original ? <p> With dupe culture on the rise , affordable options for cult beauty buys are cropping up all over . But while dupes are similar , they 're not always the exact same . <p> " Dupes are as similar as possible ; while the ingredients might not be the same , the overall visual effects of the product should be as close as possible , " Kath says . <p> Affordability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affordable beauty brands aim to create high-quality products to rival those of a luxury brand . <h> The best beauty dupes of 2023 <h> Blush <h> Advertisement <p> Kath says : " This is a great dupe for the Dior Rosy Glow Blush , which became really popular online . The Makeup Revolution Blush comes in super-pigmented colours , which suit all skin tones . If you get a blush that 's too washed out it can start to look quite grey or flat on darker skin tones , but this one has enough pigment to deliver . " <h> Highlighter <p> Kath says : " This Charlotte Tilbury Highlighter is a dupe for one of my discontinued favourites -- the Becca Shimmering Skin Perfector . While it 's not necessarily a cheaper alternative , it 's one of the best highlighters I 've ever used . I absolutely adored the Shimmering Skin Perfector in the shade Moonstone and I used it in almost every makeup that I did . I was very upset when it was discontinued , and it 's taken me years to try and find something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive than the original but it 's something I 've been looking for a long time so it 's worth it to me . " <h> Makeup remover <p> Kath says : " I 've mentioned this cleansing balm in numerous podcasts and interviews and it 's one of the best makeup removers I 've ever used . I would n't say it 's like a side-by-side dupe in terms of feel and texture , but it 's definitely the most effective that I 've used . I do n't see the point in spending a ridiculous amount of money on a cleanser that you 're washing straight off your face . It 's great for all skin types . " <h> Mascara <p> Kath says : " Mascara is another thing you do n't need to spend ridiculous money on . The Flower Beauty Lash Warrior Mascara is one of the longest-lasting , non-flaking mascaras .

Over the years , it was owned by Peter Wilson , the chairman of Sotheby 's , and the British intelligence operative Tom ? s Harris . When Mercury bought the house , it was owned by a member of the Hoare banking family . <p> She remembers walking through the green door and into the garden , " and it was so peaceful , so tranquil ; there were children playing and this house at the end of the path .

He made an offer for the asking price on the condition that it was removed from the market immediately . " <p> Garden Lodge , Austin says , became his sanctuary , a place to retreat from the spotlight , and where the harmony between his collection and its setting became something of a work of art in itself , each object carefully selected to reflect his character , his taste and sensibility . <p> A few months ago I visited Garden Lodge , prior to everything being removed to be itemised , catalogued and stored in readiness for auction , and was shown around by Austin and David Macdonald , Sotheby 's senior director and head of single-owner sales . <p> Stepping through the door into the hall , I was stopped in my tracks .

" and one of Jimi Hendrix . " He was always drawing Hendrix , " Austin said . " He adored him . " <p> ( Ephemera provides an amusing sideshow in the auction .

" But because he trusted me I 've felt so protective of everything . I 'm in a place of love , so why change it ?

I 'm heading towards , hopefully , being an octogenarian and I just felt that this had to be done in my lifetime . <p> " I looked at everything and thought , we 've had our journey . Freddie was a romantic for sure , and I am too . All these artefacts , most of them are antique ; they 've travelled the years , from the 1800s to today , they 've had various owners , they 've been loved and cherished -- that 's why they 're in such good condition . And now is their journey to their new owner . <p> " Prior to everything being taken out of the house , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and imagined them in their new life .

" That never occurred to me . " She pauses . " I always thought it was because I was useful -- it was closer to the kitchen .

She was an 18-year-old sales assistant at Biba , the fashionable Kensington boutique . He was 23 , an art school graduate -- Freddie Bulsara then -- running a clothes and textile stall in Kensington Market , about to reinvent himself as the lead singer for a group called Smile that would later become known as Queen . <p> It was the thing in those days , she says , to drop by the pub after work . " You 'd wonder , is anyone there tonight ? Just as one did in the ' 60s . I really did n't know Freddie very well at all . " <p> And then he asked her out . She remembers the date . " Fifty-four years ago on the 6th of September . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Mott the Hoople were playing . And he was a lot more open than he was in the crowd . He was very open , very warm and funny -- and we gelled . Which is not what I 'd thought ... I thought it was just a night out with one of the crowd . It never occurred to me that it was anything more than that . <p> A page from a draft of Bohemian Rhapsody . Photo / Lauren Fleishman , The New York Times <p> " Then the weeks unfolded and we 'd meet at lunchtime . He did n't have a lot of money , so it was half a lager or something , then I 'd go back to Biba , he would go back to the market . " <p> Then one day , she remembers , they were passing Barkers , the department store . <p> " There used to be a florist outside , and he said , ' Wait there , I wo n't be a minute . ' I was thinking , I 've to get back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose . He gave it to me , and I went back to Biba , thinking , what is this ? He could never articulate ... " <p> At that point , she says , she was not in love with him . " But the more we met one-to-one at the pub , and the more I got to know him , I somehow found the human being and once I found the human being I was sold . " <p> They lived together in a series of Kensington flats for the next six years . But by 1975 things were beginning to change in Mercury 's life . Queen had become a major phenomenon and were touring the world -- and he was struggling with questions about his identity and sexuality . And then came the recognition that he was gay . <p> " It was a difficult period , yes , for sure . " She pauses . " We 'd arrived at the point where he presented me with an engagement ring . I realise now , it was Christmas Day , so it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think he found , as he explored his career , and the breadth of life he was being exposed to , that he 'd arrived at that period of transition for him . I could see he was a very confused man . But with hindsight , reading the lyrics to certain songs -- mainly Bohemian Rhapsody -- you could see where the key change began . <p> " I ca n't tell you what he was thinking , because I would be assuming . But I do know he found it difficult to acknowledge within himself , and I could see it was confusing him , and hurting him . " It brought an end to their romantic relationship . " Once Freddie 's life changed I realised that I had to , and what was in the past , I had to keep very much in the past . A new chapter was beginning , and I was ready to begin that new chapter . " <p> Mary went on to have two sons , the older of whom Mercury was godfather to , although his poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While Mercury had numerous lovers , spending the last seven years of his life with Jim Hutton , it might be said that Mary was until the very end the only person he truly loved -- the person to whom he dedicated his song Love of My Life . <p> " All my lovers asked me why they could n't replace Mary , " he said in a 1985 interview , " but it 's simply impossible . The only friend I 've got is Mary , and I do n't want anybody else . To me , she was my common-law wife . To me , it was a marriage . We believe in each other , that 's enough for me . " <p> " Before he died he said , ' I 've left you the house because you would have been the woman I would have married , and by rights this would all have been yours anyway , ' " Austin says . " What do you say ? Well , OK ... " <p> It 's a measure of how much he loved you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I found more difficult than anything living in the house -- what could have been and what was are so different . How do you carry that piece of luggage through life ? You do n't . You put it in the cupboard , store it away and leave it well alone , because here was a man that could have loved you in a conventional way . Do you really want to rummage through that ? No . It is what it is . It was what it was . " <p> For more than 30 years , she says , the house has been " the most glorious memory box , because it has such love and warmth . <p> " Everything Freddie bought , he bought with a space in mind . ' Ah -- that 's the perfect size ! This is where I want to put it . Measure the wall -- it will fit beautifully . ' And where it did n't , it ended up in the loft . " <p> Mercury was a fastidious and knowledgeable collector . The bookshelves in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arts and crafts , along with auction room catalogues and magazines . He would make private visits to auction houses , but preferred not to bid himself . Instead he would send Austin or his personal assistant Peter Freestone to bid on his behalf , a blank signed cheque in hand . <p> " I 'd arrive back from an auction , and the anticipation on his face ... " Austin smiles at the memory . " ' Did you get it ? ' Yes . And then after would be , ' How much ? ' Why he would trust my judgment , I do n't know . There were one or two items that shocked me . " <p> She remembers being instructed to bid for a particular item in an auction of clocks . " It appeared , and I thought , ' Why ? ' It looked quite dilapidated ; the colour lacked lustre . So I bid , took it back , gave it to him , and I said , there were so many beautiful clocks ... And he said , ' Ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . ' And it came back , regilded , the enamel , everything -- it was just stunning . And then I realised how gifted he was . He 'd seen this and thought , ' Yes , I know exactly what I 'm going to do with you . ' " <p> The clock sat on the mantelpiece in what Mercury called the Japanese Room . He had developed a particular obsession with the country on Queen 's first tour there in 1975 , and on his trips thereafter he amassed a collection of antiques , textiles , paintings and kimonos -- lots and lots of kimonos . <p> Among the most exquisite pieces in the auction is an early woodblock print of perhaps the most famous work by the ukiyo-e artist Utagawa Hiroshige , Sudden Shower over Shin-Ohashi Bridge and Atake , 1857 . <p> When a print came up for sale at Sotheby 's in 1977 , Mary was dispatched to buy it . " But there was a large Japanese contingent at the auction , and it was getting really expensive . I thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 's going to kill me , so I stopped . When I told him , he was not pleased . Then , on his last trip to Japan , he came back and it was , ' Look what I 've bought , you 'll never guess . ' And it was the same print , and he 'd paid exactly the hammer price at Sotheby 's . " She laughs . " I felt really foolish . " <p> Everything he collected had a purpose , she says , " and a romance . And he was such a good teacher . For instance , when he started collecting Japanese prints he would explain how the artist would approach the woodblock , so every time I look at a print I remember the journey , and I remember his teaching , I could see his eye , why he would like it , the colours , the technique . It mirrored him . " <p> " I am hopeless with money , " Mercury once admitted . " I simply spend what I 've got . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not obsessively . " Although I think he realised that it could become obsessive , and then he stopped . The Japanese Room was chock-a-block . There was n't a piece of wall space where he could put any more prints . " Sorting out items for the auction , she came across a number of boxes with lot numbers , " with these beautiful prints inside ; which had never been hung on the wall " . <p> Mercury never discussed his collection publicly , and never agreed to have it , or Garden Lodge , photographed in arts , design or architectural magazines . " It was the difference between his public and private persona . Garden Lodge , and all the collection within , was private to him . He was just very discreet . " <p> The public would see the flamboyant extrovert . " But there was a side of him that was very quiet , thoughtful , meditative , " Austin says . " And that reflective , meditative person needed ' Mercury ' in order to fulfil his ambition . " <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It was his alter ego . <p> " Yes , and I 've watched people through the years who do conjure up an alter ego and the alter ego takes over . But Freddie always managed the alter ego , and Garden Lodge , and keeping that side of his life private , was Freddie 's meditative space , where he would go back to being Freddie , not ' Mercury ' . " <p> In the last flat where they lived together , she remembers , his gold discs hung on the wall . When he moved to Garden Lodge , they were put in the loft . <p> " He was such a warm , special human being , really . He cared about everyone who worked for him , and would go out buying things -- ' he or she would so love that ... ' But it was always a meaningful gift . It was never a question of , I need to curry favour here . It was always to show appreciation . <p> " He was a perfectionist about everything in life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves than they are of others -- and the only person he persecuted with his perfectionism was himself . And he would be hurt by things , but no one would see that side of him . Which made me more protective of him . " <p> Over the years , she has , in a sense , been the custodian of their relationship , refusing interviews , never talking about it until now . <p> She was sent the script for the 2018 film Bohemian Rhapsody , which starred Rami Malek as Freddie , and asked if she wanted to meet Lucy Boynton , who starred as Austin . But having guarded her privacy for so long , she chose not to , and she has never watched the film . <p> " I saw the trailers , with Rami Malek singing at Live Aid , and I thought , wow , that 's incredible editing . But then I thought , no , I ca n't watch this . Not because it 's a bad film ; but it 's not Freddie , so it 's not my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't relate to it at all . " <p> Rami Malek as Freddie Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody . Photo / Supplied <p> Now , relinquishing the objects -- the paintings , the piano , the ornaments , everything that filled the house -- is not relinquishing the memories , nor the love she shared with Mercury . <p> She has kept just one thing from their life together , a spindle chair , bought on a shopping expedition to an auction house in the King 's Road , early in their relationship . <p> " We had very little money but we needed furniture . He found this chair , and haggled -- we got it for ? 5 -- and it was n't in great order . So we glued it back together . Since then I 've had it repaired and refurbished , and I thought I would keep it for sentimental reasons . " <p> Now the house is empty , she says , it 's as if she has been transported back to the day of viewing it for the first time , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a family house , really . " She has not yet decided whether to sell or keep it . <p> There is nothing that has gone that she misses . " I can still see everything in my mind 's eye . Going through the house I replace the blank wall with the Tissot . Over the years everything has become so familiar . Through the objects I can still see and feel and remember happy times . The ghosts that were here before are gone . It took a while for them to go , but then all the nice memories fall into place . " <p> What were the ghosts ? <p> " Watching Freddie become frail , watching him pass away ... " She pauses . <p> " How do you explain that this individual human being deserved my total and utter appreciation , and love ? And that love did alter , it had its journey . <p> " I think Shakespeare put it best in the sonnets : ' Love is not love , Which alters when it alteration finds . ' And that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not one I quite understood at the beginning , but when you read the sonnets and you reflect , you think , yes , that is love . It 's a wonderful emotion to feel , and a wonderful emotion to accept from another human being . But it took me a long time to understand that . " <p> She thinks about this . " Freddie 's death was the hardest thing of all to deal with . But the rest was just joy . Everything he bought had a joyful connotation , and then went on to mean a lot to him . There 's a lot of love shifting through all the artefacts and through the house . Really , his last gift was the gift of love . "

Photo / Mara Sommer <p> You know you want it , but can you justify it ? Jessica Beresford puts forward the case for buying that dream handbag . <p> A recent Christie 's auction of handbags , including rare styles by Dior , Chanel and Hermes , fetched US$4.1 million ( $6.8m ) , setting the record as the highest value of its kind inthe US . <p> Among the lots was an Hermes Kellywood that sold for US$176,400 -- a world-record auction price for a particularly rare model , festooned with a geometric pattern inspired by the house 's famous scarf print . <p> Though sitting at the very high end of the market , the sale reiterates how expensive and lucrative luxury handbags have become . A medium Chanel classic flap bag , for example , now costs US$10,200 , up 16 per cent from 2022 and 10 times more expensive than it was in the 1990s , according to Christie 's . <p> Prices of Birkin bags have drastically increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to US$30,000 . And that 's if Hermes even lets you buy one , which is usually dependent on a customer 's relationship with their store ( known as the famous Birkin " list " ) . <p> For the Birkin bag , money may not be enough . Photo / Getty Images <p> Though gold has historically been the most valuable and recession-proof asset one can carry , personal luxury goods are becoming increasingly popular as an investment category . <p> That 's not in the sense of " investment dressing " -- a term bandied around by fashion magazines to encourage readers to buy expensive pants -- but items such as handbags , watches and jewellery that can potentially increase in value after they 've left the shop . <p> " Designer handbags have been one of our fastest-growing categories , " says Jess Mackenzie , Webb 's manager of designer handbags and luxury accessories . <p> In New Zealand , these often include brands that do n't have retailers locally , including Hermes , Chanel and Bottega Veneta , as well as Louis Vuitton luggage such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have seen that special limited-edition pieces , for example , the Louis Vuitton Christmas lines that often sell out during the pre-sales , tend to retain their value due to the difficulty in acquiring one , " adds Mackenzie . <p> This November , Christie 's is offering a course , " Collecting Handbags as an Alternative Asset " , which teaches participants to better understand which handbags are likely to appreciate in value through understanding different styles , leathers , shapes and construction , as well as their place in the collector 's market today . The course is being offered in Hong Kong , where some of the world 's most valuable handbag auctions have taken place -- including the sale of a rare , diamond-studded Hermes Himalaya Kelly bag in 2021 for more than US$500,000 . <p> Webb 's has also seen an increase in its jewellery category , with appreciating items including " large diamonds and coloured stones of top quality " ; the auction house recently sold a 3.01 emerald-cut diamond to an investor . <p> " Stones of this size and quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accessibility becomes reduced and they become more sought after , " adds Mackenzie . <p> Watches , too , are increasingly being seen as investment items , with pre-owned watch sales hitting US$22 billion in 2021 , accounting for nearly a third of the total market , according to BCG . And styles from the biggest brands -- including Rolex , Patek Philippe , and Audemars Piguet -- continue to fetch eye-watering prices at auction . <p> " There is even an index for watches now , " says Pie Funds chief investment officer Mike Taylor , noting The Rolex Market Index which tracks the financial performance of timepieces on the second-hand market , comprising the top 30 models by transaction value . <p> " So personal luxury goods are definitely an alternative investment class , but not for the faint-hearted -- you need to be very patient and often wait a decade for your investment to go up .

It went so far as to state that " an increasingly powerful China " was " posing challenges to existing rules and norms .

@@101501230 <h> GUEST BLOG : Ben Morgan -- Last week was a good week for Ukraine , a breakthrough may be close ! <p> The campaign to re-capture Ukraine 's Sea of Azov coast turned in favour of Ukraine last week . Most commentators agree that reaching the Sea of Azov and severing the Crimean Land Bridge is Ukraine 's objective this summer . The Crimean Land Bridge is the piece of coast that runs roughly from Mariupol in the east to the Dnipro River in the west , that was captured by Russia at the start of the war . It is important because Russia 's heavy rail lines from its main military logistics hub in Rostov-on-Don run through the area , marked as a yellow line on the map below , to reach Russia 's troops on the Dnipro River , in southern Zaporizhia and most importantly for Putin in Crimea . <p> The only other supply route into these areas is via the Kerch Bridge , a bridge that Ukraine is currently attacking on a regular basis and will probably destroy soon . If both the Crimean Land Bridge and the Kerch Bridge are interdicted , holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Putin suffers an enormous political defeat because it destroys the legacy of his 2014 invasion of the peninsular . An indication of how important holding this territory is to Russia are the black lines on the map . The black lines are Russian defensive lines dug to stop Ukraine achieving this goal . The blue arrows on the map represent Ukraine 's current axes of advance : <p> The axis that started at Orikhiv and is pushing south towards Tokmak and Melitopol . <p> The operation to flatten the Velyka Novosilka salient . <p> The advance on Bakhmut . <p> Around Velyka Novosilka and Bakhmut this week there was plenty of fighting but little movement to report . Instead , it seems that Ukraine is starting to commit its main effort ( its NATO equipped and trained reserve forces ) into the fight to advance on Tokmak . <p> The advance towards Tokmak is into ' the teeth ' of Russia 's strongest defences and has taken a long time to develop . Ukraine working slowly to shape Russian forces for a decisive battle . Now after months of ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along a wide front to make the Russians move their soldiers around , deploy their reserves and unmask their artillery allowing Ukraine to use its more sophisticated artillery to attrit the defenders . And ; ' starving ' the frontline of ammunition , fuel , food and medical supplies by relentlessly targeting Russia 's logistics network . Now , Ukraine 's work is starting to pay dividends and last week they ' broke into ' Russia 's first line of defence . Then , as predicted in last week 's column , Ukraine 's next step was to widen the breach . <p> On the Deep State base map , below , Ukraine 's approximate progress this week is shown as light blue and grey ' contested areas ' that I have then marked with dark blue arrows . Next week we should expect to see Ukraine expand the breach into the area highlighted in light blue . It seems likely that Ukraine 's next steps will be as follows : <p> Maintain pressure on Novopropivka , this village and its southern neighbours sit on high ground ; and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is vital for supplying an advance south . When Novopropivka is captured , Ukraine will hold the high ground and can observe artillery fire onto Tokmak . This axis may not go all the way to Tokmak because it requires crossing the Chynul River , an operation that will be difficult without complete artillery supremacy . It seems more likely that Ukraine will develop other axes of advance and attack Tokmak from the north-west or north-east ; or both . <p> Ukraine is therefore likely to try and broaden the base of its breach pushing west to expand the bridgehead and advance south to control the high ground that is marked in grey on the map . Although , a relatively slight rise , holding this ground allows Ukraine to support the advance on Axis A. <p> The Ukrainians are already pushing east towards Verbove , likely with similar intentions to widen the base of their penetration so that they can generate more force pushing south . Ukraine will try to widen the base of the breach sufficiently that their force on Axis A is not subject to enfilading fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advancing south on the T0408 highway that only need to worry about fighting in one direction . It is also likely that this axis of advance will culminate with the capture of Verbove . The urban area provides a firm base , to anchor a secure eastern shoulder for the push south . <p> Ukraine 's push south is developing into the key battle of this summer 's campaign . Regardless of mainstream media reporting , Ukraine still has lots of capacity with most of its reserve still uncommitted . Further , Russia 's forces are starting to look weaker . Last week we discussed Russia 's rapid and poorly executed withdrawals from Robotyne and Urozhaine and this week there were more reports of low morale amongst Russian soldiers and severe equipment shortages . A situation Japanese researcher Yu Koizumi , from the University of Tokyo may have confirmed last week when he reported Russia is moving soldiers and S300 missiles out of the contested Kuril Islands , most likely to replace losses in the Ukraine . Movement of Russia 's elite paratroopers from other sectors of the front to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers from Russia 's best infantry unit , the 76th Guards Airborne Division were being withdrawn from near Bakhmut to reinforce the southern front . An indication of how serious the problem in the south is for Russia . <p> TDB Recommends NewzEngine.com <p> Ukraine 's drone attack on Pskov Airfield , about 900km north of Kyiv and home to Russia 's best airborne units ; and the transport aircraft that move them must have sent a ' chill down the spine ' of Russian staff planners . Although the attack did not destroy many aircraft it demonstrated Ukraine 's ability to hit Russia 's strategic reserves ; and the attack 's synchronisation with Ukrainian operations in Zaporizhia is hard to miss . That Ukraine came close to knocking out a big part of Russia 's airlift capability would be very worrying because it is much quicker to fly soldiers around than to move them by road or by rail . <p> Across the remainder of the campaign , it seems unlikely that Ukraine will expend too much effort on either Bakhmut or Velyka Novosilka at this stage ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operational level there has been a great deal of discussion about Russia attempting to ' turn Ukraine 's flank ' with an attack from the Svatove -- Kremina line towards Kharkiv . In the map below Ukraine 's advance on Melitopol is shown as a blue arrow and the possible Russian offensive is shown as a red arrow . A large and well-coordinated attack in this area would put enormous pressure on Ukraine , forcing it to withdraw forces from the battle in the south and redeploy them to protect its north . <p> In my opinion , there is little chance of this offensive coming to fruition . Some commentators have stated that Russia has around 100,000 soldiers in this area , and they may be correct . However , the soldiers in that area are not elite paratroopers from the 76th Guards Airborne Division , they are recently mobilised , poorly trained conscripts . If Russia is planning to attack in this area , then it will need to withdraw some of its few remaining well-trained and experienced soldiers from other parts of the frontline to spearhead the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analyst , Mark Galeotti described this concentration of troops and the possibility of an offensive in this area as incompetent , an activity driven by ' breast beating machismo ' rather than military logic . A desire by General Gerasimov to give his leader , Putin a victory , any victory rather than accepting that defeat in the south is now an imminent possibility . <p> My assessment is that a successful Russian attack in this area is impossible because it is likely that every well-trained infantry soldier Russia has ; is currently committed . If Russia is stupid enough to take quality troops from the southern front to mount an attack in the north-east then it will only help Ukraine . Further , even a successful attack is likely to be held by Ukraine on the Oskil River , a natural barrier , running north-south about 20-30km behind the current frontline . <p> Since the start of the war , we have discussed the importance of high-quality infantry soldiers and the fact that Russia started the war with too few . Infantry soldiers are the people that fill the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slide down into the sewers to move undetected so they can ambush their enemies or that climb the tallest hills and buildings to observe and report on the enemy . Infantry soldiers are the people that after the artillery barrage finishes ; and 70 tonne enemy tanks are speeding at them , firing 120mm shells must standfast and hold their line . Then if the line is broken , they get out of their trenches or fox holes and counter-attack the enemy often fighting literally ' tooth and claw ' ( or grenade , bayonet and entrenching tool ) at close quarters . It is a tough job , and few people are mentally and physically equipped to do it . Russia lost most of its best infantry early in the war and has been playing catch-up ever since . Conscripts can hold ground but to attack successfully you need good infantry and the few remaining infantry soldiers Russia has are already over-extended . <p> Putin 's handling of the Wagner insurrection further weakens Russia . Estimates of Wagner 's strength at the time of the insurrection vary from between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better capacity to mount offensive operations than Russia 's regular units . The sudden and suspicious death of their leadership ; not only Yevgeny Prigozhin but also Dmitry Utkin certainly undermines the ease with which these very useful soldiers can be brought back into the fight . Most likely they will quietly disappear out of Belarus rather than accept Putin 's demand to swear allegiance to the Russian command structure . At a time when Russia needs reserves it might have been better to keep Prigozhin ' in the tent ' and work with him to integrate this force back into Russia 's command structure . <p> In summary , this week has been a good one for Ukraine with important progress . On 2 September , John Kirby a Whitehouse spokesman alluded to successful Ukrainian progress in the last 72 hours .

My assessment is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is focussed on holding ground ; or throwing their forces forward to make sure Ukraine does not take territory . This is likely to mean that if Ukraine can breach the first line of Russia 's defence , then successive lines of defence will be weaker . Russia 's reserves are running out so if Ukraine can get behind their defences , it is likely that there will be rapid and significant advances . <p> Big picture Russia is now in a weak position , and rumours that Putin is secretly reaching out to President Erdogan of Turkey may be true because if Ukraine 's tempo increases it will be a matter of days before Ukrainian artillery is able to close the P37 highway that runs east-west through Tokmak supplying garrisons in eastern Kherson on west side of the Dnipro River . Negotiation may be Putin 's only way out and the sooner it starts the more land he will keep . <p> Finally , if Tokmak falls Ukraine is in a very strong position , akin to a ' fork ' in chess because from this junction it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or it can veer east on the P37 Highway and advance towards Berdiansk .

@@101501232 <p> A statement from Don Franks and James Robb , Workers Now candidates for Wellington Central and Panmure-Otahuhu. 31 August 2023 . <p> The Minister of Immigration . Andrew Little , has ordered a ' review ' of the Accredited Employer Work Visa Scheme , after revelations of widespread abuses which left more than a hundred migrant workers from India and Bangladesh jobless in Auckland . The workers were stuck in squalid overcrowded conditions , relying on the charity of the local mosque for food . <p> Little has said there are " serious concerns " about exploitation of workers and abuses of the Scheme . Some 81,000 migrant workers have arrived under the scheme since it was set up just over a year ago . Some industries have become heavily dependent on immigrant workers brought in under such schemes , including horticulture , construction , large sectors of private health care and hospitality , and now , urban bus transport . <p> Little 's professed concern about exploitation and abuses of migrant workers is the purest hypocrisy . Superexploitation of migrants from low-wage countries isthe whole purpose of such work visa schemes . They rest on the huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zealand , and the countries of the semicolonial world where the immigrants come from , including most of Asia , the Pacific Islands , South America and Africa . Such schemes harness that inequality , and the desperation of workers seeking to escape those conditions , for the benefit of employers in New Zealand . They aim to make some of that cheap labour available to the bosses in New Zealand . Some 27,900 employers have signed up for this profit-building gift from the government . <p> All workers are exploited . No employer in the history of capitalism has ever hired a worker as an act of generosity . They hire us because they can make more money from selling the things we produce with our labour than they pay us in wages . Exploitation is built into the wages system -- this is where their profits come from , at the normal price of labour . <p> When the big-business media talk about exploitation , they are referring to superexploitation , when workers have to work even longer hours and for lower wages than the norm , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' agents ' and middlemen along the way . <p> The Accredited Employer Work Visa scheme was set up to facilitate superexploitation of migrant workers . It has set in motion a swarm of ' recruiters ' and ' immigration agents ' in the countries where the workers are recruited , parasites who profit from the desperation of workers seeking to migrate , charging them tens of thousands for a visa , apparently without any regulation or control . There is nothing new about selling visas -- in fact , the government itself charges extortionate fees . <p> Under the scheme , workers are contracted to a single employer for up to three years . This leaves them dependent on the boss not just for their wages , but for their right to remain in the country , and thus it makes it very difficult for them to fight for their rights , or even to complain about abuses by their employers . The prospect of eventually gaining permanent residency in New Zealand and bringing out their families is dangled before them , even though this is impossible for most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers are paid equal wages to New Zealand-born workers , the government still escapes having to pay their social wage -- the costs of their occupational training , health care and education for their children , care of their retired family members , and so on , still falls on their families back in their country of origin . ( This also applies to many immigrants on other visas as well ) . It 's a win-win situation for the employers and the government that serves them . <p> Schemes like this are added obstacles to union organisation . Using this scheme , urban bus transport companies have largely been able to solve the labour shortages which caused widespread cancellations of services earlier in the year . In Auckland alone , hundreds of immigrant bus drivers have been hired in the past six months . But these workers are hired on a separate contract , different from the contract covering the unionised drivers . Some of them were told that if they joined the union they would be dismissed and deported . This was later retracted when it was pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a threat . But few of the drivers have joined the union nonetheless . The separate contract is a serious threat to all the bus drivers . <p> The government has moved against violations of the scheme -- by further punishing the victims of the scams . Ten workers have been turned back at the airport . They held valid visas , for which they had been charged tens of thousands of dollars , and had been recruited by fraudulent employers . Hundreds more have been contacted and told not to leave their home countries . To date , no employer has been prosecuted . This is a government that serves the employers and no one else . <p> What should the labour movement do in response to this situation ? <p> First -- fight to abolish the Accredited Employer Work Visa scheme , with all its oppressive anti-worker provisions . Let in all the visa-holders who have been turned back , now . Eliminate the parasitic ' immigration agents ' who extort large sums in exchange for visas , by taking the process out of private hands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employers who want to hire immigrants pay the costs . <p> Fight for full union rights for all immigrant workers on arrival . No separate contracts . For equal pay and conditions for all workers , immigrant and native-born . Prosecute the employers who threaten sanctions against migrant workers who join unions . <p> Full residency and civil rights for migrant workers , including the right to vote . Full freedom of movement within the country , no restrictions on changing jobs , no restrictions on where workers may live or contacts and relationships with local people . Citizenship rights for those who choose to stay . Open the borders to the free movement of labour , as a step towards overcoming the unequal wages which divide and weaken our class internationally . <p> is standing for the working class in the 2023 general election .

This led to police sources saying the CIPEM officers seemed to have been thrown under the bus by Fitzgerald . <p> However , following further revelations by Stuff about CIPEM , Anderson and Ross emailed colleagues in December last year saying the use of CIPEM interviews to investigate cold cases was being suspended . <p> These emails were previously released to Stuff by police under the Official Information Act . <p> However , police attempted to conceal the contents of other emails sent at this time -- which reveal how concerned officers actually were about CIPEM and the lack of support for those using it . <p> These emails were only released a fortnight ago after police were told to do so by the Ombudsman , following a complaint by Stuff . <p> In one of the disclosed emails , Dylan Ross , then an acting detective senior sergeant , takes the extraordinary step of warning all other CIPEM/PEACE Plus-trained officers not to use the technique until a national review of all investigative interviewing is completed . <p> " I know we have discussed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) but I will say it again for your benefit and my own peace of mind -- I would certainly caution you to be aware of being involved in any interviews as a " Peace Plus " trained person within district during this interim period . <p> " You will have noticed the ongoing media attention to the CIPEM/Peace Plus model and unfortunately , from experience , I can not assure you that there will be support down the track , particularly until the manual , policy and training are finalised/updated . <p> " It is vital to Det Inspector Steve Anderson ( Tumaru/Raro ) and I that none of you experience the kind of situation that we have been confronted with over the last year . " <p> Four days later , police hierarchy backtracked and sent out another email , saying the use of CIPEM in cold cases had not been suspended . <p> They again publicly blamed Anderson , who is one of the most experienced CIPEM practitioners , for the bungle , saying his email " was incorrect and should not have been sent " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a major Stuff expose of the CIPEM technique , another senior officer , Whanganui area commander Inspector Ross Grantham , wrote to Detective Superintendent Dave Lynch regarding the review of police interviewing , saying he was " extremely disappointed in how our foundation work has been tainted , and would love to see NZ Police again leading the world with our investigative interview material and training .

@@101558230 <p> NZ Indian Business Association members from the Liquor industry background have expressed strong displeasure and disappointment with the latest amendments introduced to the Sale and Supply of Alcohol Bill . These amendments to the law hugely discriminate against the entire liquor retail industry , particularly the small businesses as it has shifted the balance shifting the entire balance in disfavour of the licence holders who have invested their lifetime savings building up their businesses working hard through the years . The feedback received from the small retailers in the liquor and hospitality businesses is that they are quite scared of the consequences due to the uncertainty surrounding their future . <p> Although the intent of the amendment is Alcohol harm minimization , it is disputable that this object will be met with this Act . Most of the provisions in the Act are a cause for concern , the primary one being allowing District Licensing Committees to introduce the new Local Alcohol Policies under which the retrospective approach to existing license holders could result in refusal to license upon renewal if found inconsistent with the new Local Alcohol Policy ( LAP ) on the grounds of density restrictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harm . This can be substantiated by the fact that the number of Alcohol outlets has increased over the last 35 years from 3,000 to 11,000 , though proportionately higher compared to the increment in population , the alcohol consumption has declined 25 percent . <p> The other two main changes that have been introduced include - allowing a person or group to object to the licenses nationwide and also restricting the rights of the license holder or their counsel to interrogate the objectors during the hearings . This snatches the fundamental right of the defence and undermines the justice system . Many of the cases were decided in ARLA in favor of license holders where the objectors failed to justify their objections before the Committee during the hearings , and the removal of this right means devoiding the license holders of their right to the justice system . This law was pushed through in a hurry without giving any consideration to the consequences and ignoring the voices of the various stakeholders can be seen as a contemptuous move against the small businesses , who do not have enough resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The majority of the outlets are operating their businesses responsibly and there is already stricter legislation in place to check the imbalances and irresponsible sale of liquor , so reducing the number of outlets does not translate to a reduction in consumption . The robust license renewal process , training requirements for the staff , and ongoing checks by the Health Department , Liquor Licensing Inspectorate , and the police adequately ensure harm minimization . One of the strongest arguments placed by the Communities group before the Select Committee is the budget that goes towards addressing the health issues related to alcohol harm , however , it is not based on evidence that the health issues are solely related to alcohol harm , although it might be one of the contributory factors . The effect of alcohol consumption on individual health varies depending on genetics and various other factors . <p> The vast majority of the population enjoy social drinking in our society and the venues also conduct their operations responsibly , keeping the environment safe . The original Sale and Supply of Alcohol Act 2012 has over the years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required was to allow District Licensing Committees ( DLC ) to enact the Local Alcohol Policy ( LAP ) to restrict the number of new Licenses in the various localities where there was an actual problem due to the drinking culture .

@@101558239 <h> The Compounding Threat Of Invasive Alien Species -- Expert Reaction <h> Biological invasions cost the global community an estimated USD$423 billion in 2019 , and those costs have quadrupled every decade since 1970 . <p> The Assessment Report on Invasive Alien Species and their Control is a new report released by the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services ( IPBES ) , looking at one of the five most important direct drivers of biodiversity loss . The authors say ambitious progress in tackling invasive alien species is achievable , but governments and different sectors have to start collaborating more to get the job done . <p> The SMC asked local experts to comment on the report . <h> Distinguished Professor Philip Hulme , Lincoln University , comments : <p> Note : Distinguished Professor Philip Hulme is a coordinating lead author of the IPBES Assessment . <p> " The Assessment Report on Invasive Alien Species and their Control approved by representatives of the 143 member States of the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services ( IPBES ) is a watershed moment in our global understanding of biosecurity and biological invasions.The overwhelming evidence of major economic , social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and ecosystem health is a wake-up call to the global community to take up a more unified approach to combatting these threats worldwide . <p> " Aotearoa New Zealand is no stranger to these problems with a long list of threats that have been successfully averted such as the southern saltmarsh mosquito , red imported fire ant , and Queensland fruit fly . These successes and our hardline attitude towards biological invasions have established Aotearoa New Zealand as a global leader in biosecurity , a reputation we should build upon to play a key role in the development of international capacity in this field . <p> " The IPBES report points to key areas where the advances made in Aotearoa New Zealand can be disseminated worldwide including biological control , aerial deployment of toxins , engagement with industry , as well as our strong biosecurity governance structures . But our world-leading successes should not lead to a complacent attitude with myrtle rust , fall army worm , and the Asian clam slipping through our border controls . <p> " A stronger , more capable , and more aware global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by securing cleaner trade and compliant international travel . As a nation , we have a huge role to play in the leadership of any global approach and ensure that our policy research , and educational expertise is at the forefront of future developments . <p> " The IPBES report should therefore be seen as a catalyst for new global approach to biosecurity , one in which Aotearoa New Zealand will play a pivotal role . " <p> Conflict of interest statement : Coordinating lead author of the IPBES Assessment <h> Professor Jacqueline Beggs , University of Auckland , comments : <p> " The report card for introduced alien species is alarming . It 's a grim tale of devastation , with introduced species driving 60% of species extinctions , wreaking havoc on our quality of life and exacting a massive global economic toll , estimated at a whopping US$423 billion in 2019 -- and costs increasing four-fold every decade . The legacy of already established species is bad enough , but the surge in the number of alien species globally is relentless . The pace of invasion is unprecedented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zealand , with its unique native plants and animals , is now a battleground against alien invaders . Recent arrivals of exotic Caulerpa seaweeds threaten to smother our marine ecosystems , while the fall armyworm can attack over 350 plant species threatening food security . Most of these unwelcome guests hitch a ride on the expansion of global trade and human travel . Therefore , the need for effective border control has never been more critical . New Zealand has one of the world 's best biosecurity systems , but its effectiveness hinges on sustained funding and capacity-building efforts . <p> " The COVID-19 pandemic was , in essence , a biosecurity breach that underlined the formidable challenge of managing unwanted species . One invaluable lesson from this crisis was the paramount importance of collaboration to exchange ideas , align our goals , pool our expertise , leverage technology , and share vital information . Biosecurity , as a whole , stands to gain significantly from enhanced international cooperation . Moreover , adopting cutting-edge technologies for improved detection and management of introduced species is imperative . It is time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest statement : " Jacqueline is the Director of the Centre for Biodiversity and Biosecurity ( UoA and Manaaki Whenua , Landcare Research ) and the UoA centre on climate , biodiversity and society , Nga Ara Whetu . " <p> Professor Sebastian Leuzinger , School of Science , Auckland University of Technology , comments : <p> " The report shows alarming trends in the impact of invasive species on natural ecosystems and livelihoods . The problem is large and global , and in size matches the impacts of climate change , land use change ( mainly destruction of natural habitat ) , pollution , and biodiversity loss , with all five intricately connected and the last one largely a consequence of the former four . The exponential trends of the number and impact of invasive species is hardly surprising in a globally highly connected world . Just a look at a visualisation of the daily shipping routes of goods globally illustrates that unintended displacements of organisms have been and will always be part of modern human civilisation . Historically speaking , a large part of human development and wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boundaries . <p> " Tackling the problem can not consist of blindly condemning any non-native species , instead , carefully weighing off all five mentioned environmental pressures and with a cost-benefit analysis is critical . This leads to some tricky and highly political questions in the example of Aotearoa/New Zealand : with a given amount of money , say one million $ , should we attempt to remove an aggressive weed from an area , or instead plant a few hectares of pine forest ( which will likely turn into native forest over time ) that quickly removes carbon from the atmosphere and prevent the loss of species locally and globally through climate change mitigation ? <p> " I think awareness in Aotearoa/New Zealand on invasive species is higher than in other places of the world , and without becoming complacent , it is fair to say that New Zealand is doing a very good job , including many decades of successful biosecurity control at our borders . The report confirms that aggressive elimination programmes are most successful on islands , and should focus on those ( e.g. the pest-free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combat invasives such as the Caulerpa seaweed in the Hauraki Gulf are much harder and are ultimately a lost battle , so that awareness and containment of the problem might be the only solution . " <p> " The just released IPBES report is an impressively comprehensive compilation of the research relevant to the global problem of invasive alien species . As the report notes , island nations like New Zealand remain directly in the firing line , with 20% of all impacts threatening nature and nature 's contribution to people recorded on islands . <p> " None of this is new to New Zealanders with numerous previous reports focusing on these issues , including the recent ( 2021 ) PCE report titled " Space invaders " on the serious and ongoing problem with weed invasion and spread . <p> " Professor Stoett 's optimistic concluding message that ambitious progress in tackling invasive alien species is achievable must surely be tempered by the magnitude of the resourcing lift and shift that would be needed to implement the containment and/or eradication needed to address the ever-increasing flow of ecosystem capturing alien @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Two recent concerning examples of inadequate management responses in New Zealand are the national funding cutbacks for wilding pine control and the arrival of the golden clam in the Waikato River . In the first case ( wilding pines ) , the good progress made in recent years is likely to stall and the previous investment squandered by not continuing control efforts . And in the second case , the golden clam , recognised globally as a serious infrastructure and environment threat , was overlooked for at least two years , followed by an insufficient response . <p> " Hopefully the IPBES report will provide further indisputable evidence that New Zealand and other countries must do better , if there is any hope of stemming the tide of alien invasive species resulting from a global transportation and economic trade model overlain by global climate change .

Indigenous Peoples and local communities are disproportionately disadvantaged and at greater risk due to the dependence on ecological integrity and cultural identity . <p> " This statement strongly resonates in Aotearoa New Zealand , where pest mammals such as deer , goats are stripping the understory of our forests and leading to massive soil erosion as observed with the recent devastating events in Tairawhiti-Gisborne following Cyclone Gabrielle , and invasive insects like wasps that cause severe economic and environmental damage , with costs to manage exceeding $150 million per year and growing , and those are only two examples of the many plaguing Aotearoa New Zealand communities . <p> " The key global consensus message of giving Indigenous people a stronger voice in biosecurity decision-making and the need to build capacity among local communities to address these threats resonates strongly with our mahi in Bioprotection Aotearoa . Governments worldwide have agreed as part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of priority invasive species by 50% by 2030 . While Aotearoa New Zealand is an acknowledged global leader in border biosecurity , there remains much scope to address the inequities in our biosecurity system that disadvantage our communities . This needs to happen well before 2030 if we are to have a resilient nation where future generations can thrive . " <p> No conflict of interest . <p> Dr Axel Heiser , Chief Scientist , AgResearch , comments : <p> " The IPBES report is an important piece of leadership in the global discussion on invasive species . It highlights the critical importance of giving this issue the attention and resource needed to address it . <p> " It is also highly relevant to Aotearoa-New Zealand , where so much of our economy is exposed to significant damage or catastrophe from incursions by invasive pathogens , pests and weeds . <p> " Most New Zealanders will be only too aware of the impact of cattle disease Mycoplasma bovis in recent years for our economy and our communities . While excellent progress has been made in the eradication effort , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities today and industries have to remain on guard . Likewise , the arrival of the Fall armyworm pest last year is posing a significant threat to our growers and is requiring a major response effort . <p> " Because of these very real events , awareness of the risk of invasive alien species has been raised in New Zealand ; but the report underscores the need to act in a globally unified and coordinated way . <p> " Our country 's agricultural sector is intricately tied to our unique ecosystems and biodiversity . As global temperatures rise due to climate change , the potential for new invasive species to establish themselves or further spread in New Zealand , increases . Certain mosquito , mite and tick species could become more prevalent and increase the risk of diseases in livestock , such as Bluetongue Virus , anaplasmosis , or theileriosis . Kudzu and other invasive weeds species could thrive in areas where they are now limited ; and so could plant pests , like Brown Marmorated Stink Bug . <p> " New Zealand already has stringent border biosecurity measures in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the report emphasises , there is still a substantial need for research to fill knowledge gaps and develop effective management strategies . <p> " We are fortunate to have strong existing collaborations such as Better Border Biosecurity ( B3 ) , which brings together the research expertise on plant pests and diseases across science providers such as AgResearch . " <p> " Horticultural industries in New Zealand have the enviable position of achieving access for our premium temperate fruit into countries that have some of the world 's most stringent phytosanitary requirements . This is enabled by the continuous development of low input , low residue pest and pathogen management tools resulting in clean , healthy fruit with ultra-low to nil residues of non-persistent soft chemistries . Invasive species can disrupt these finely tuned production systems , and for some species like fruit flies , their presence in New Zealand can cause the immediate shut-down of access of our fruit into those valuable overseas markets . <p> " The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services on Invasive Alien Species and their Control highlights the challenges we face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species as a consequence of global trade . Also of concern are those benign alien species already here that could become invasive down the track , a.k.a. ' sleeper pests , ' if for example the environment changes , say from increased warmer winter temperatures or novel biotic interactions , that could allow them to flourish in unpredictable ways . The report shows that costs from invasive alien species are increasing by 400% every decade . For a country that is a large producer of primary products , this provides a significant challenge to production . In addition , at a societal level the costs are attributed disproportionately , with those industries involving people who are closer to the natural world most affected . <p> " Fortunately , New Zealand has one of the best biosecurity systems in the world . Initiatives like MPI 's Emerging Risks System provide excellent horizon scanning for future issues . Strategic partnerships such as the Government Industry Agreement for biosecurity readiness and response activities enable an increase in the co-ordination across the biosecurity continuum . Biosecurity must remain a priority area for the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international collaboration . " <p> Nicholas Ling , Associate Professor in Ecology and Biodiversity , University of Waikato , comments : <p> " The release of the IPBES 10 report on ' Invasive Alien Species and their Control ' is a wake up call to governments to do more to control the spread and impacts of alien species , especially as global climate change extends the habitable zones of many exotic species and restricts the natural ranges of indigenous plants and animals . <p> " While the devastating impacts of terrestrial exotic species on New Zealand 's biodiversity and pastoral economy , and the ongoing costs of control programmes , are well known , less well recognised is the cost of alien species on freshwater and marine ecosystems . The recent discovery of well established populations of Asian golden clam in the Waikato River and caulerpa seaweed in Northland serve as a timely reminder that despite some of the most stringent biosecurity controls of any country , New Zealand is not immune to the introduction of new and potentially harmful alien species . <p> " New Zealand is considered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all our freshwater fish being exotic species and around the same proportion of wetland and aquatic plants . While some introduced fish like trout and salmon undoubtedly have important economic and recreational benefits , they also significantly contribute to the decline in native freshwater fish . Around 70% of endemic species are now considered threatened . Other exotic species like koi carp and bullhead catfish have little to no benefit and cause significant harm to biodiversity and water quality . Koi carp now comprise greater than 50% of all fish biomass in the lower Waikato River , and their dominance of waterways contributes significantly to poor water quality and the likelihood of toxic algal blooms . The recent introduction of bullhead catfish to Lakes Rotoiti and Rotorua is implicated in a greater than 90% decline in native koura ( crayfish ) . <p> " Globally , costs associated with exotic species now exceed NZD$700 billion annually , with costs in New Zealand estimated at greater than $1.4 billion . Predator Free 2050 is a highly ambitious and aspirational programme to rid New Zealand of pests and save our indigenous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tools even for the most common terrestrial pests . New Zealand is facing additional significant and escalating costs to deal with aquatic invasive species . " <p> No conflict of interest . <p> Dr. Ang McGaughran , Senior Lecturer and Principal Investigator of the Invasomics Lab , University of Waikato , comments : <p> " The world is under escalating threat from invasive alien species and we need to collectively up our biosecurity game . The report released by IPBES on ' Invasive Alien Species and Their Control ' notes that invasive alien species reached a global cost of more than 423 billion in 2019 . Yet , only 8% of those costs came from management ( the remaining 92% relate to negative impacts like disease transmission and food supply losses ) . <p> " Although we have many of the tools required to prevent or minimise biological invasion , current measures are generally insufficient and the report outlines 40 areas where additional research is needed . Key among these current gaps are a lack of understanding of the drivers that facilitate biological invasion , and a lack of tools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead to better preparedness and prevention , and I see genomic tools as a particularly important emerging technology for biosecurity that will help us to better predict , prioritise , detect , and manage biological invasions . <p> " The report also recognises that preventing and controlling invasive alien species can have positive spillover into biodiversity benefits . Indeed , biosecurity and biodiversity are two parts of the same problem . Thus , a strong theme in the report is integration , collaboration , and cross-disciplinary thinking . <p> " Overall , the report provides a comprehensive examination of invasive alien species -- including a confronting assessment of current global trends in invasive species threats , while also providing concrete recommendations that signal hope for achievable progress against these threats moving forward .

I remember it as if it was yesterday , indeed it was Friday 15/09/2023 -- the day before yesterday . It was the Editor of The Daily Blog asking if I was going to do the next RNZ review on Kim Hill . Odd -- why ? What 's she done now that would be of any consequence at all ? What wee Welly drama could this possibly be about ? Did she get a ticket for riding her broomstick in a cycle lane ? Tory Whanau-ed some overrated bar ? Or something fitting her personality type : been arrested for the cold case disappearances of uppity male baristas ? Or is she dying and does that mean George Hamilton can get his skin back ? Or something completely implausible -- like come out as straight ? <p> I paid it no mind . I gave the editor a call about something else half an hour or so later , and then remembered about Kim Hill -- what 's occurred ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over twitter , so much crying etc . Oh , OK . No tortured barista escaping from her EV down Lambton Quay then , like the part in Marathon Man where Dustin Hoffman 's character escapes , like the innocent nostalgia of a " distressed , naked teen " running down the street Darren Hughes-type scenario -- never mind . His tone was matter of fact with maybe a hint of pride or satisfaction or something , like I was supposed to do something about that , a eulogy , an epitaph , bury her , burn her , drown her in a bath of holy water . So , my first reaction was : is that it ? It was n't a thought or a feeling , no emotional engagement , just nothing ; then : what does it mean , write a column , OK . I proffered my scepticism : " Well , you know how it works -- Leighton Smith , Merv Smith and Paul Holmes and anyone in radio announces their retirement and the c*nts are still doing their f*cking shows three years later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually leaving ?

These radio talent departures are almost never immediate , such as a Tova-strophic ratings meltdown , so it must be a Mani-fest ego trip over contracts . <p> Before I could look it up online the RNZ bulletin was on air : Kim Hill will end the Saturday show , but continue to do something or other .

It was the shock it was hoping to be and then some . An uncontrollable chain reaction starting the day after it was released . The look on Ben 's face was like Oppenheimer witnessing the blast ... when the atmosphere of the planet started to combust . Craccum was to publishing as the Young Ones was to television and Ben was a combination of Rick , Vyvyan and Neil -- he too became briefly relevant . <p> Anyway , my piece was especially egregious because it seemed plausible as a moral position that not all suicide was wrong , that counsellors were useless and whatever else inflammatory but defensible things were said in that thrashing essay .

She was anticipating an evisceration , a dismemberment . I could hear it in her voice and that made me say : OK , sure . Bring it then . I would have finished my eggs on toast and have a cuppa ready . I had listened to Kim Hill as a matter of course because that 's what 's on RNZ and so you listen to it . I did n't like her ( how could you , she 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I did n't dislike her particularly , she was just a bit of a constipated Pom in need of an enema . There was no trepidation . <p> The interview starts and it 's not so much a tango as a knife fight in a car park . I was determined to keep it upbeat , positive , constructive , serious but chatty . But after about five or six minutes maybe we get into this elongated metaphor that goes backwards and forwards and eventually too far for her . Up to this point it 's going OK , we 're both cut , but standing , no knock-downs , however she 's becoming more breathless , more exasperated , and it 's the equivalent to the third or fourth round in boxing terms , and I can hear the huffing , the puffing , the steaming .

So , I 'm in my bedroom , cup of earl grey on the desk pad , swivel chair reclined at a jaunty angle , the receiver of the phone to my ear , like an idiot , listening to this silence .

So , apart from that run-in many years ago , I have no problems with her and can be unbiased I hope you agree . <p> So back to Bitchy McBitchface . Women think her vinegar is misanthropic -- she hates people . No , not quite . She hates people alright -- to the degree that person is not politically correct yes , but there is a bilious stripe for the half of people armed with a built on rape kit .

It 's like racism , the person dishing it out and the person getting it both know what it is even if everyone else does n't , or chooses not to .

If I recall correctly that was more or less JFK 's assessment of why the South Vietnamese President 's wife was so bitter -- she only held power through men . The counter-argument to that has some weight , if I may mansplain it . <p> Why is Kim Hill a hateful bitch ? She is touted as such -- her fans will list her hateful bitchiness as her major attraction . Did men generate her vaunted characteristic ?

@@102143232 <h> Yahoo News <h> Doctor 's Wife Dies Days After Giving Birth to Their Baby -- And He Called the Code with Her in His Arms ( Exclusive ) <p> Georgia Slater <p> 26 September 2023 at 2:00 pm*12-min read <p> Ten days after giving birth to the couple 's second baby boy , Caitlyn Wilson died from childbirth complications <p> Courtesy of Jared Wilson <p> When Jared Wilson brought pregnant wife Caitlyn into the hospital to give birth to their baby boy Gabriel , he never expected he 'd only get to bring one of them home . <p> On Dec. 12 , Wilson dropped off his wife , 27 , at the hospital in Buffalo , New York , for her scheduled induction and then went home for the day to take care of their then-1-year-old son Lincoln . <p> Later that night , Wilson , an anesthesiologist resident at the hospital , joined Caitlyn where everything " seemed to be going really , really well . " She got her epidural around 1 a.m. the next morning and an OB resident came in to break her water shortly after . <p> " Positioning-wise , we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out just fine , " recalls Wilson . " But when the resident broke her water and was trying to help position him , his arm was somewhat above his face , in a raised position , and directly behind it was the umbilical cord . " <p> " She swooped one or the other and it resulted in his arm coming out into the birth canal and the cord getting pinched between his neck and his head and the wall as the fluid drained out . That leads to a condition called uterine cord prolapse , which has a really , really high mortality rate for the baby because he immediately starts to suffocate . " <p> Never miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE 's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer , from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories . <p> Wilson says the nurses and chiefs were then called in and the chief resident " put her hand basically all the way up to Cait 's uterus and lifted Gabriel inside the birth canal off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Things were happening really fast . At 2:02 a.m. , I texted both sets of parents to pray for Caitlyn , because she was leaving the room to be wheeled down the hallway into the OR , " he recalls . " At 2:17 the surgeons came back to me with pictures dated at 2:12 that Gabriel was out , he was healthy , he was screaming , all signs looked good . So in a matter of 10 minutes , they wheeled her down to the OR , opened her up and had a baby out . " <p> Wilson explains that Caitlyn 's complications came when doctors had to transition her to general anesthesia and intubate her in the OR as she still had feeling in her stomach because the epidural had only been placed about 20 minutes prior to her emergency c-section . <p> " One of the risks of general anesthesia always is significant aspiration of stomach fluids and contents to go back down into her lungs . That 's increased for trauma in emergency situations , particularly in a pregnant woman who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giant baby pushing up on her stomach and her lungs , " he tells PEOPLE . " When they intubated Caitlyn , she had cups and cups of fluid , both water and stomach acid , come up and go down into her mouth . As they suctioned it out and placed the tube , the concern was how much of that ended up in her lungs . " <p> " About two hours later , she gets wheeled back into the room and she 's on oxygen , just a tiny bit . The surgery went well , the c-section went well . Of course , they sutured pretty hard and pretty strong because they did n't bother to separate layers or move things around . You just cut down to the baby and get the baby out . " <p> Courtesy of Jared Wilson <p> " That increases her recovery time , and it 's very difficult and very painful , particularly when you feel like you 've swallowed a swimming pool because Cait was coughing really , really hard , " Wilson continues , noting that prior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bronchitis and still had " pretty inflamed and reactive " airways . <p> Caitlyn was having a hard time coughing strong enough as her " stomach felt like it was going to tear open . " <p> " She got a lot out , and Gabriel was healthy and he was safe , and Caitlyn seemed safe and healthy , " Wilson remembers thinking . " She looked like she was probably going to struggle for a little bit , and she started antibiotics to make sure she did n't get any kind of pneumonia from the fluid . " <p> " But the plan was she 's a healthy 27-year-old with no other health conditions whatsoever . People aspirate food in their lungs all the time when they get drunk and fall down , or they vomit and pass out . A healthy 27-year-old should bounce back really quickly . " <p> Over the next 10 days , Wilson says some complications came up here and there which were " perfectly hidden by a perfect storm of aspiration , emergency surgery and pregnancy . " At the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivery unit to have her oxygen monitored , was eager to get home to her babies . <p> " She was in obvious significant pain and her heart rate was high . She had swelling in her lower legs . She had this massive hormonal shift with a c-section and milk letdown and a baby . And of course , the stress of being in a hospital and being on oxygen and hooked up to these monitors and just wanting to go home with the baby . " <p> Courtesy of Jared Wilson <p> Not long after , Caitlyn progressed to the point where she needed more oxygen and was transferred to the intensive care unit ( ICU ) . At that point , Wilson brought Gabriel home and Caitlyn was put on the " max support as far as oxygen goes that was non-invasive . " <p> " Every day it was kind of the same . She would slowly progressively need a little bit more oxygen , but she was awake , she was talking to us and the pain was well controlled on the medications , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened to be Wilson 's 30th birthday -- Caitlyn was intubated due to the inflammation in her lungs . " She wanted to have a little bit of rest and allow us to place a tube and have the machine to do the breathing for her , " Wilson recalls . " She was tired of running this marathon and I could see it in her . " <p> " Immediately things went wrong , " Wilson recalls . " Up to this point , the only medications Caitlyn had been on were some low-dose pain meds and stuff for acid reflux and constipation . She was the healthiest person in the ICU . " <p> " The minute we intubated and she desaturated , we could not keep Caitlyn up . The machine is designed perfectly to match human respiratory function and it could n't do it , " Wilson explains . " At the exact same time , labs , which had never really returned abnormal in nine days , suddenly started to show a double white count . She went from 10 to 40 in under eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Courtesy of Jared Wilson <p> " At the same time that she decided to let other people help her so that she could rest , we suddenly lost her blood pressure and we could n't keep it high enough . And because she was pregnant and she 's prone to swelling because she 's very leaky , all the fluid that they dumped into her , it does n't stay within the vascular system . It starts to spread into the tissues and the muscle . " <p> " The more fluid we put into her , if it starts to leak it can leak into the lungs , which is exactly what we do n't want . But she 's dehydrated , so we ca n't not give her fluid . Her blood pressure 's low and she 's lost a lot of blood , so we have to give fluids and blood , " he continues . <p> " At the same time , we discovered that she had a minimum of two blood clots in her legs with evidence that there may have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And from all the ultrasounds that we had done , it looked like her heart was having obstructive shock . And the treatment for that is to not give fluids . But at the same time , due to the white count , she was in septic shock . And treatment for that is to give massive amounts of fluids . And then , of course , with blood clots it can only get worse , and so you also need to put them on blood thinners . She 's barely a week out from an emergency c-section where she 's already lost a lot of blood , so that 's dangerous , " Wilson explains . <p> " So up until the 21 , Caitlyn had been a healthy , talking , pale and tired , strong , amazing woman , and she tired out as anybody would . But the second she allowed others to help her and to take a rest from her own fight , 12 hours after we intubated , she coded for the first time , " says Wilson . " And we got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or 3:00 in the morning , we started to see signs of organ damage that we just were not maintaining either oxygen , or the blood pressure , or controlling the sepsis . " <p> Courtesy of Jared Wilson <p> " We were trying to do literally everything we could for this 27-year-old and it was n't working . The last ditch effort was to put her on dialysis to try to clean the acid and the white blood cells to help provide healthy blood to all of her organs . But in doing so , you take fluid away from the body and in septic shock , again , you need fluid . " <p> On Dec. 22 , at 6:56 a.m. , Caitlyn coded for the second time . When Wilson got to her room around 6:59 a.m. , Wilson says doctors had already been in the code the second time for about three minutes . <p> " They were just about to push more epinephrine and switch people doing compressions , and I just had to call the code , " Wilson recalls , noting that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's an anesthesiologist there . <p> " Because of my profession and other things , they allowed me to stay as a courtesy every night . And to be there at that time , and to be wearing the same uniform that a bunch of other doctors were , I walked into the room as they were providing compressions to Caitlyn and I asked them to stop , and I called the code , " he says , getting emotional . " They turned off the machines , and then they left as I held Caitlyn . And that was it . " <p> Courtesy of Jared Wilson <p> A few weeks after Caitlyn 's passing , Wilson and the boys flew out to Utah to stay with Caitlyn 's parents until they were able to have her funeral on Jan. 15 . Wilson also shares his appreciation for his own parents , who " sold three houses and two vehicles " and " liquidated everything in their life " to leave Utah and drive to Buffalo to move in with him and his sons following Caitlyn 's death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told them Caitlyn might not make it , " he says . " I had n't even contemplated the idea of how I was supposed to work a 75-hour work week and make as little as a resident makes and take care of these two boys . " <p> Looking back on his early days bonding with his newborn son Gabriel , Wilson says the experience was vastly different than with his firstborn . <p> " I watched Lincoln be birthed and see my wife hold him seconds after . And there 's a bond that forms with something like that to see the motherly love . Gabriel , I did n't get to see that , " he shares . " They delivered Gabriel to me in a bundle that night . He could have been anybody 's baby . I hate to say that . " <p> " Throughout the whole hospital course , we really had n't had this time to bond with this baby the way that you would want to in those first 10 days . That happy period , " he says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole way . " <p> Courtesy of Jared Wilson <p> As he reflects on Caitlyn 's experience , Wilson says despite the tragic outcome , he thinks of the nursing staff , physicians and everyone at the hospital as " angels and heroes in my eyes . " <p> " Cait had the gold standard of tests , the gold standard of care , " he says . " She required no real treatment besides oxygen for days , and then it just went south so quickly . But as an anesthesiologist , all of her complications are things that I think about with all of my patients every day doing the exact same procedures . " <p> " She received the absolute best of care . And if I did n't know all of those things , I think there would be more to grieve in not understanding how this happened , " he adds . <p> And while Wilson continues to mourn the loss of his wife , he tells PEOPLE he finds comfort in that he spent " three and a half years with this amazing woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last a lifetime , because as difficult as it will be to raise these boys as a single dad and a doctor , and they wo n't know their mom the way that they should , and they wo n't know of her love for them the way that they should , I 'll have to work on how to do it , " he shares . <p> " But true love , as sappy and as fairytale and cheesy as it sounds , is real , and it absolutely transcends any boundary of death , life , distance , or mom , that those three years are enough for me to live the rest of my life on . And they 're enough that the boys will know of their mom . " <p> " Her family loves , and misses , and honors her daily , " Wilson adds . " We are working on so many ways to remember her and teach my sons about their mom so that they can know her . "

@@102618234 <h> Our MMP voting system explained <p> Note : This article was originally published in 2020 but has been updated . <p> Photo : RNZ / Nate McKinnon <p> This is what you need to know about voting and MMP . <h> What is MMP ? <p> MMP stands for Mixed Member Proportional representation , the electoral system used in New Zealand . <p> A majority of New Zealanders voted for it - twice , first in a non-binding referendum in 1992 , and again in a binding referendum at the election the following year . It was introduced in the next election , in 1996 . <p> MMP aims to ensure that people will be represented in Parliament both by a person in their local area ( electorate ) , and by a group ( a political party ) . <h> How does it work ? <p> New Zealanders have two votes - one for a local representative , and one for a political party . You just pick the person in your electorate you think best advances your interests , and the political party that best represents your interests . <p> Simple , right ? <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ translate into the seats available for members of Parliament ( MPs ) . <p> There are ( typically ) 120 seats : <p> 72 are electorate seats and are won by candidates standing in specific areas <p> 48 are list seats and are allocated depending on the proportion of party votes won , taking into account the number of electorate seats each party has won <p> Basically , it all means that the proportion of party votes should be about the same as the proportion of seats in the Parliament . Electorate MPs will belong to one party or another unless they 're running as an independent , but voters do not need to vote for an electorate representative that matches their party vote . <h> Other things to consider <p> A party has to win at least 5 percent of votes or an electorate seat to win a seat in Parliament . <p> If they win an electorate seat , the party gets allocated a percentage of list seats based on their party vote - known as the " coat tail " rule . <p> If a party wins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , extra seats can be added to the Parliament to make up for the " overhang " and ensure the proportions remain correct . For instance , this meant there were 121 MPs in 2005 , 122 MPs in 2008 and 121 in 2011 . <h> So who wins the election ? <p> In contrast to some countries overseas , the United States for example , the election in New Zealand is not voting for the country 's leader . People vote only for the parties and electorates . <p> But someone has to be in charge . Someone has to make sure the organisations doing all the management of the country - funding hospitals and schools , repairing roads and infrastructure , managing prisons - all that administrative stuff , and more , is being done properly . <p> This responsibility - and the power it entails - belongs to the government . <p> Who gets to become the government is basically whichever party can get a majority - more than 50 percent - of the seats , based on their party vote . If none of the parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must negotiate with each other about their plans until a combination of the parties has at least half the seats . <p> This can result in a coalition - where the bigger party and smaller party form a government together and come up with a complete policy plan - or a confidence and supply agreement , where the smaller parties agree to support the main , governing , party on specific policies . <p> Under confidence and supply , the smaller party does not need to support policies that fall outside the agreement . <p> With 50 percent of the seats in Parliament , the governing party or coalition can decide what to change about how the country works and enact these decisions in Parliament . <p> The governing parties have most of the power . The parties that are not governing are known as the opposition , and it is their job to criticise and poke holes in the plans the government is putting forward . <p> New Zealanders get two votes under the MMP system . Photo : RNZ <h> Will MMP ever change ? <p> Not everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more people wanted to keep it than replace it . <p> In the 2011 election , a referendum - much like the recreational cannabis and end of life choice referendums in the 2020 election - was held to see if MMP was still the preferred way of doing things . <p> The referendum asked two questions : whether voters wanted to keep MMP or replace it , and what system would be preferred if it was changed . Almost 58 percent of voters wanted to keep it , an increase of 3.91 over the 1993 binding referendum . <p> Extend the time citizens can be overseas without losing the right to vote from one electoral cycle to two <p> Allow Maori voters to switch between rolls any time up to and including election day <p> Extend the right to vote to all prisoners <p> A complete rewrite of the Electoral Act 1993 using modern drafting language and fill in a few gaps <p> Modernise voting processes , including for advance voting <p> Improve and tighten donations and loans regulations , balanced by an increase to state funding of parties ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The independent review considered more than 1700 written submissions and is due to release its final report in November , after the 2023 election . <p> Although it is unlikely New Zealand will switch from MMP any time soon , it is possible we will see of these changes to some of the rules in time . This could be done through a referendum or the passage of legislation through Parliament . <p> First published 8.01pm , 11 October 2020 . Last updated 12.54pm , 1 September 2023.

Because the electorate hated Labour so much . <p> That voters did n't care National , ACT and NZ First would unleash madness highlights how much voters were burnt by Covid lockdowns and Labour 's grotesque incrementalism . <p> Add into that one of the worst campaigns by Chippy ever and Labour have been destroyed this election . <p> With the specials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overhang , National and ACT will gloriously be forced into Government with Winston . <p> We have just elected a Government of antivaxx quacks , anti-indigenous Maori racists and climate deniers who will do the bidding of the Real Estate Pimps , Trucking Industry , the Corporate Farmers , the Banks and the Gambling Industry FFS ! <p> If you thought Labour were bad , after 3 years of this National/ACT/NZ First nightmare , you will be screaming for Covid to make a come back ! <p> There are of course after an election some political Winners and Losers ... <h> WINNERS : <p> Real Estate Pimps -- The lobbyists who wrote National 's property policy are all having drug fuelled orgies in celebration of this devastating win for Landlords and obscene inequality . The Real Estate Pimps paid $2million in donations to the political right to remove the Foreign Buyers Ban , give Landlords massive tax loopholes that 'll benefit mega landlords to the tune of hundreds of millions and give Landlords the right to evict , and what a pay day the Real Estate Pimps have gained ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ban and selling that grotesque manipulation as a revenue source rather than locking another generation out from home ownership is the greatest lie ever perpetrated on the people of Aotearoa , and the sleepy hobbits of muddle NuZilind swallowed it hook , line and sinker because of WEF Jabcinda and the Plandemic ! The Real Estate Pimps are the true winners of this Election and using Paula Bennet as their proxy in the mainstream media was a stroke of genius . <p> Maori Party -- The backlash to this being the most racist election ever held generated an enormous drive within Maoridom to step up for themselves . Nanaia being beaten by a 21 year old highlights the power of demographics that now rule Maori politics . 70% of Maoridom are under the age of 40 and they wo n't put up with the Right using them as a political punching bag any longer . When ACT start their racist race war inducing referendum , the resistance will be based from these Maori electorates and will generate immediate friction to any referendum . <p> Naked white fragility racism -- Never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once to scream , ' but what about cracker ' quite like this election . Because Labour are cowards , they never explained what the fuck 3 Waters or Co-Governance was and on the odd occasion they did try to explain it , like the fishhook laden 3 Waters and the ludicrous Tamati Coffee induced attempt to weight votes more to Maori , it only fuelled white fragility fears even more . Because Labour would n't engage , Astroturf dark money filled the void and convinced white voters that this was an existential race war secretly developed by Radical Nationalist Maori to steal da water when it was nothing of the sort . As raw sewage pumps into Auckland Harbour and water contamination rises with 70% of rivers unswimmable , watching fragile white egos forced to boil their water before they can drink it after muttering ' but He Puapua is apartheid ' seems a perfectly acceptable outcome . <p> Brooke Van Veldon -- As a 30 year old , Brooke is the only woman in NZ who dresses like she 's 53 !

During the debate , Brooke almost seemed aroused by the idea of slashing 15000 Government jobs where as O'Connor took a far more dignified and compassionate approach by calling for no slash and burn . Unfortunately this is Tamaki , which is Maori for , ' Angry White Rich people living near the beach ' , and anything less than the sacking of all public servants and sowing salt in their gardens is unacceptable .

We will yearn for the day Stuart Nash sent Cabinet briefings as the highest point of ethical standards in comparison . <p> National Party Caucus Meeting <p> Corporate Farmers -- The corporate farmers win again ! After rigging the entire political system to empower them and their profit margins no matter the cost to our environment or geopolitical safety , the corporate farmers have managed to put off doing anything meaningful on emissions for another fucking 5 years ! When you consider Helen Clark first called for emission reductions in 2003 , Corporate Farmers have managed to prevent any changes for 25 years now !

The breath of fresh air CTU Economist Craig Renney injected in the last month of the election with research that undermined the economic credibility of National 's deeply flawed tax policy was what the Left should have been doing for the last 3 years ! The Left have walked away from economics and focused on the low hanging fruit of identity politics which only divides using pure temple politics rather than Broadchurch Solidarity . The common ground between people is their class , not their identity and Craig Renney is the blueprint for how the Left wins in 2026 . <p> Bank Oligopoly and Supermarket Duopoly -- The powerful who shape our under regulated capitalism are safe because National builds monopolies , they do n't break them .

Deserves a Cabinet position as the only National Party MP with more charm than a road accident . <p> Jacinda -- It was weird that while Covid shaped everything , we refused to talk about it like it was a taboo trauma . So much bitterness towards a shared universal experience was always going to cause cultural and political backlash . For many their Covid sacrifice was unequal in an unequal society and for those who made anti-vixx and anti-mandate their identity it created an ostracisation they had never encountered and warped them with terminal resentment forever . How else can you explain the existence of The Platform ? As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leadership in her Covid response saved 20 000 lives ! Labour were ready to fight the Covid War but lost the Covid Peace.That research was a reminder in the dying days of the campaign that Jacinda 's courage will be noted by the historians even as those who benefited rebelled against her . Pity she did nothing with the unprecedented MMP majority and reverted to incrementalism instead of true transformative change . <h> LOSERS : <p> Haha . Now explain why you fucking sold us out on the wealth tax clown ! <p> Chippy -- You sausage roll eating muppet ! ' Captain 's call ? ? ? ? ' , and who were you the Captain of Chippy ? The Fucking Titanic ! Every single step in the campaign Chippy fucked up because he was cut from the exact same timid incrementalism Jacinda was locked into . When the GST off fresh Fruit and Vegetables was leaked , Chippy had a chance to save this insipid meaningless policy by extending it to ALL Supermarket bought food , but he did n't because he was too weak . He killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funded by the mega wealthy to give every Kiwi their first $10 000 tax free , but he refused to do it because he 's weak . Chippy should step down immediately as Leader , his never ending feckless missteps cost Labour the election . What the fuck was the point of Bread and Butter politics if no one could afford the Bread and Butter ? I do n't want to see another fucking sausage roll for the rest of the year ! <p> Labour -- Look , I 'm not saying there we n't some gains over the last 6 years : Free school lunches , trust tax , new top income rate , free prescriptions , most state houses in 50 years , record investment in housing , healthcare and investment , regulate property managers , clean car discount , apprenticeship scheme , benefits to wages , FPAs -- all great first steps , but after 6 years of ' first good steps ' , you realised you were just jogging on the spot ! We were promised transformative , what we got was less left wing than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Professional Managerial Class , they see the solution is better bureaucratic structures rather than an upgrade of the Capacity of the State and so spent 6 years recreating bureaucratic structures without the necessary upgrade of capacity . Labour refused to explain what the hell 3 Waters or Co-governance meant because Jacinda hated conflict ( her Cabinet meetings were nicknamed ' The Good Ship Lollypop ' because she would n't tolerate any negativity ) and would n't engage on co-governance or 3 Waters which allowed astroturf dark money to take over the debate and manufacture it into an existential race issue . Fundamentally Labour needed to tax the rich to pay for the social infrastructure we needed , but because Labour at heart are intellectual cowards , they refused to engage in that , which left voters asking , ' why bother voting for Labour ' . Why indeed . Labour face oblivion , will probably gain 2 MPs from the Specials so will limp home with 28% or 29% . <p> Greens -- Will do far better from the Specials and picked up two new electorates because the woke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , but they are now totally impotent with Labour out of power . The worst mistake the Greens could make now is to misconstrue this result as proof positive their alienating woke middle class dogma was somehow successful , it was n't . Greens only gained because Labour were so spineless . The Greens need to step back and consider the future because resistance to what National/ACT/NZF are about to attempt will be desperately required . It is obvious Chloe is the future leader and that transition should occur after the Summer . <p> Of course Chris Luxon believes in dinosaurs ! <p> National -- Ran possibly the worst election strategy in history . Refused to rule Winston out , then ruled Winston him in , then begged the electorate to not make National work with Winston . Pushed a policy platform of spite and created fake Foreign Buyers Tax revenue to magically gloss over their tax policy . Luxon is thick as two planks and sold deodorant and left Air NZ with $3billion in debt . If there is a God , he will leave National with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifting their Foreign Buyers ban . <p> I 'm Captain Icarus and I 'm going to drive this plane like a chariot into the sun ! <p> ACT -- Started out with so much promise by using the culture war ammunition the woke middle class activists generated and leveraged the resentment against Labour , but the naked extremism of ACT and what they intended to do scared voters once they got over their blind anger towards Labour . ACTs extremist policy agenda spooked voters and left ACT with gun lobby fetishists and Treaty race baiting . We all wait to see if ACTs race war generating racist referendum will be allowed past Winston after the Specials . <p> Chris Bishop -- Did Captain Grumpy Pants have a break down ? <p> Bishop acted like a teenage tantrum for most of National 's disastrous campaign , and kept attacking things like a dog chasing parked cars . For a 40 year old , his gaunt bitter appearance has aged him , I ca n't work out if it 's nicotine or being in the National Party . <p> Simeon Brown -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I despise him . <p> ... Simeon gets sadistic kicks out of race baiting about da gangs da gangs as if he 's some tough guy . I would n't be surprised at all if he was caught with a huge number of unexplained children 's shoes under his house . <p> Climate Change -- National/ACT/NZ First are a climate denial Government who will do all they can to allow polluters to do what they want to keep profiting from their pollution . The planet will burn while Luxon makes loves to a cow , the planet will boil while David Seymour decries climate alarmism and the planet will melt as Winston mumbles about gambling and cigarette taxes . <p> We are fucked on the climate change front for a full 3 years until these lunatics get thrown out . <p> Beneficiaries -- No one ever lost votes bashing beneficiaries and when National was n't blowing the real estate industry , they were bashing beneficiaries . All the punitive measures about to be launched against our sickest and weakest will be the blueprint adopted to privatise welfare . Outside agencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list and that can be done two ways , 1 ) if you find them a job or 2 ) -- you cut them off for some bullshit infraction on their ridiculous work ready conditions .

White collar criminals who take billions each year however will receive a free pass . <p> Home Ownership -- Already at the lowest level in 70 years , National 's removal of the Foreign Buyers Ban will lock out another generation from home ownership as the speculators rush back into the market . <p> Woke Middle Class Identity Activists -- After handing so much culture war ammunition to the Right , our woke middle class identity activists literally drove male voters into the arms of the political right .

Labour will pick up more and turn some electorate seats , Greens will go up , National will lose two and the Maori Party may win another electorate and generate an overhang forcing National and ACT to form a coalition with NZ First . If there is a God , ACT and National deserve Winston . <p> Gang Tangi Shoot Out -- National have pledged to pass their stupid gang patch law in the first 100 days meaning the first Gang tangi held after that in Summer 2024 will have all eyes on Luxon to demand Police enter the tangi and remove those patches , the way he did during his Paddy Gower debate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negative global media attention , which wo n't help with our tourism brand .

The squeezed middle will scream at National to do something . <p> Gaza -- The looming war crimes about to be committed by the IDF will spark a revolt in the West Bank and invasion by Hizbollah which will generate an American response , which will generate an Iranian response which will generate an Israeli response which will generate a Russian response which will generate another American response .

If he says no , National 's entire economic model falls to pieces and all those Real Estate Pimps who funded the Rights campaign will be incandescent with rage . <p> If Winston refuses to budge , National and ACT will blame NZ First and demand a second election . Everything for National rests on lifting the foreign buyers ban , and if Winston wo n't budge they have no choice but a second election . <p> That 's how powerful the Real Estate Pimps have now become politically in NZ . <h> CONCLUSION : <p> New Zealand -- Ultimately the biggest losers are New Zealand .

The poorest amongst us will fund a tax cut to rich landlords while the most vulnerable from beneficiaries , state house tenants , prisoners , drug addicts , the working classes and the disabled are all going to face insufferable and punitive sanctions . <p> A National/ACT/NZ First Government will only serve to compound counter productive policy that will deform , punish and mutate those stereotypes the Right despise and used to whip up the worst angels of our nature . <p> We are a poorer people for this change . <p> The Left needs a good hard long look at themselves . <p> Increasingly having independent opinion in a mainstream media environment which mostly echo one another has become more important than ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please donate here . <p> If you ca n't contribute but want to help , please always feel free to share our blogs on social media <h> 39 COMMENTS <p> Great article &amp; an accurate description of events . At least the party I voted for improved their position so it was not a wasted vote . Greed is good will be how the government operates for the next 3 years ( if they last that long ) so being in the water filter/purification business might be a good earner as the privileged few decide that as they can afford their own clean water there is no need to have safe public water supplies . <p> Unfortunately for Labour as soon as they get into Govt the Unions go Gangbusters , with Strike after strike making the Govt look bad and now Docs , Nurses and teachers have has their biggest payrise in years they will sit quietly for the next 3 years and the Nats will take the credit for that I 'm sure as they will for the declining ram raids . Labour should also have kept the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reelected or left it to National to have to raise it as people clearly do n't care where the money is going to come from and as with John Keys lie about not raising GST , people forget . <p> I think you are right.It would have been sensible to float a wealth tax and CGT to have a point of difference a couple if dollars of fruit and veg which most believed they would not get was hardly a winner . Personally I am very happy with the result and think we will see the results of policy change in 18 months to lead into 2026 . <p> Yeah , wages getting held down , more homelessness , as people get kicked out of rentals and state houses , unemployed localsgetting dispaced by immigrants . But the ram raids and gang funerals will still carry on as usual . The emergency wait times will still continue , but people will be sent home after 6 hours with a pamphlet and an 0800 number . <p> So you DO N'T want terrible hospital wait times to come down , ram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have been ? Well Millsy I have news for you , the outcomes will change for the better ... I know you are terrified that things get better under a National Govt and your drug crazed ' predictions ' will not come to pass . If so , all we can hope for is you will announce your departure from blogs ' again ! ' that you promised before , but like Labour ... another broken promise eh ? <p> I am sick and tired of ignorant commenters who unfairly slate unions . A common meme is that the teachers did nothing under National , then struck like mad under Labour . As a former teacher unionist , I would like to point out that contracts now tend to last for 4 years , so it is only once every 4 years that teachers can legally campaign and strike . Secondary teachers were all set to fight like hell in 2011 , under the John Key Govt . But at the critical time , the Christchurch earthquakes happened . Work it out for yourselves , muppets like Jules and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause trouble ? Simplistic bullshit on your part . <p> Old Zealand with a sizeable chunk of New New Zealand ... Hell , many are n't even citizens . Wait for that to become common knowledge as people realise there will be perma-NACT on the back of foreign voters . Shh ! do n't tell the truth , now ! <p> There are two Maori electorates that are less than 500 votes apart , so if those flip to TPM under specials , we will have the following ( assuming Port Waikato brings in a National overhang ) : Total seats = 124 ( 3 from TPM , 1 from National ) Lab -- 34 , Greens 14 , TPM -- 6 = 54 seats ( 9 short of the 63 seats needed to govern ) Nat -- 50 , ACT -- 11 = 62 seats ( 1 short of the 63 seats needed to govern ) . NZF -- 8 , can only form a government with NACT . <p> However , add in a typical shift of a seat to the left bloc under specials , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seats ( 8 short of the 63 needed to govern ) , NAT + Act = 61 seats ( 2 short of the 63 ) , NZF = 8 , can form government with either bloc . <p> In this scenario Labour should just call Winston and offer him the PM-ship for the lulz and to troll NACT . Everyone knows if that happens , he will go for it lmao ... <p> If none of that happens , and the specials simply go the way they did in 2017 , then the news for the left bloc is even better ( in terms of being closer to forming a government with Winston ) . But Labour seem to have thrown the towel in so .. who knows really ... <p> Wo n't happen . Winston knows he fucked up in 2017 just by being petty and childish about his beef with National . He knows he 's responsible for the fucking mess the country is in by putting a kindergarten govt in charge . He wo n't shit on his conservative voters again . <p> Labour should start a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- hell they should start the rumour by actually doing it . It will give Winston so much bargaining power it will be hilarious . <p> Plus Winston at this point is the only one that can save us from Act 's extremism . I know he says all sorts of crazy shit on the campaign trail but the entire reason he set up NZ First was to oppose neoliberalism . And the whole reason Roger Douglas set up ACT was to extend neoliberalism so I ca n't see it being an easy negotiation . <p> If Luson was smart he would n't go into coalition with either of them and just play them off against each other . I do n't think he is that smart but I 'm open to being surprised . <p> No . I hope it got NZ an end to the absence of choice . An end to forcing the left and the working-class into voting for a right-wing Labour with the threat of ' worse under National ' . Not courage , vision , policies and positive action , just the ever-present threat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . I do n't think the political class had any idea of the level of anger in the community . Blaming the electorate 's stupidity needs to end quickly -- the left has a lot of work to do . <p> If Labour survives as anything more than a quaint nostalgia party for National to rely on for a few more votes for the right , there must be some serious soul-searching . This must be the end of standing for nothing . <p> Richard you are so right . History and our grandchildren will not judge us kindly for the feckless right wing greedy voters . I had almost come to terms with the whole debacle yesterday and there was some relief at not having to listen to the media 's relentless propaganda against the government . No doubt mistakes were made but how on earth do you recover from a global pandemic in 5 mins . In reflection I think Labour was doomed when it was elected as a majority government . They were always going to fall from a great height and there are obviously no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same left were very high . While in reality it enabled the right wing to rebuild and not have to do very much in opposition for 3 years . Luxon has been out and about campaigning for the last 2 years , while Jacinda and Chris Hipkins we 're dealing with disasters . Very quietly the money was rolling in to both National and ACT . Were the Labour party blinded by the very businesses ( who stated they were broke ) and they then supported through covid . Now these very same businesses were probably donating the same tax payer dollars to the right wing parties . Also in the last few weeks of this campaign we have seen no other but the media darling John Key in the mix no doubt Stephen Joyce is also in the background pulling Luxon 's strings . We are in for a torrid time nothing will be what it seems there will be no honesty , no transparency In fact its already started with negotiations behind closed doors . <p> The answer is for all rooms to close their cat doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idiotic course you are too cowardly to even say out loud , i.e. to do nothing and wait for the typhoon . You stupid , stupid " any excuse will do " freaks just make me sick . <p> Ahhh Richard , So we are all just going to ignore the hundreds of thousands of tons of Indonesian coal imported to NZ over the last 6 years ( whilst NZ sitting on about a trillion tons of the stuff underfoot . ) Sooooo ' NO MINING ! ' , but buy in hundreds of thousands of tons from another country . Guess if National was doing this you would all be outraged , but shhhh Labour did it . <p> From my conversations with workmates and family , and observations from people whose opinions I respect , there are three reasons the Labour vote collapsed while the Greens and TPM did n't . They are a ) Jacinda and Chippy did n't adopt CGT and Wealth tax as their core support wanted , b ) they did n't implement any of the recommendations from the beneficiary inquiry , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 Waters and Co-governance was about . When the low income and beneficiaries do n't get listened to they either switch -- as many did , or they do n't vote -- as many more did . They know they 're in for three rough years , during which the growing underclass in this country will harden . If it coalesces into an organised group , look out , because the parliamentary protests over vaccines will look like a quarrel in kindergarten . Just remember which branch of our military their children join if they do n't join a gang , and also remember what the predominant race of our SAS is . What may happen is both the CTU and Labour party might , just might , remember where it 's roots lie , and return to them . Then it might adopt policies that will suit the 75% of Kiwis that earn less than the average wage . <p> Chippy needs to stay on , and Labour needs to hit the ground running and work to winning the next election . NACT needs to be prised out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult , but not impossible , they almost did it in 1993 . <p> For what its worth , I think a referendum should be held on a CGT/Wealth tax . Throw it out to the people and let them decide . <p> Labour had all the advantages of incumbency including resources and implemented policies such as the funding of MSM to the tune of $55 million plus more than double that in government advertising spend largely promoting their brand/policy/ideology . Thus I do n't think the election was bought as despite all this advantage they lost badly . National attracted funding because their ideas were popular and the converse is true too ; Labour donations were low because their policy was unpopular and performance poor . <p> IMO the public IMO punished Labour for lack of delivery and general incompetence . National seemed more credible and the feeling that it was time for a change gained strength as the elections approached . Imploding ministers and the useless GST removal proposal reinforced a sense that Labour had done their dash . BTW I did not vote National or Labour and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Services -- When Winston kills off National 's lifting of the foreign buyers ban , National 's entire economic house of cards collapses requiring mass public service cut backs , which will be funny because even if Winston greens lights it , it can never raise enough revenue to prevent National from slashing public services . <p> Public Transport -- National will mutilate public transport just as oil prices are about to skyrocket due to the looming war in the Middle East . <p> Workers -- Bosses to gain back the right to fire and scrap the Fair Pay Agreements which were the most substantial workers rights legislation passed in the last 40 years . <p> Renters -- Landlords to gain the right to evict , social housing builds will stop and Landlords will gain enormous powers as rental regulations are all rolled back . <p> And the Nasties bought the election and did not win it . <p> LINO and Hipkins are to blame for thinking they could coast along with the promise of getting back to basics and they could n't even deliver that because they represent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his traditional supporters he has thrown to the corporate wolves but for himself ! ! ! ! <p> " I expect the next three years to be vicious , cruel , and stupid -- and that 's before even considering the divisive effects of ACT 's proposed Treaty referendum ( which is an invite for social unrest ) . My hope is that National is forced into the arms of Winston , and then suffers his curse ( two out of three governments forced to work with Winston have lost the next election -- the exception being Ardern , who was saved by covid ) " <p> " So , yesterday we voted , and unsurprisingly , the party which stood for nothing and offered nothing lost . Anyone surprised by this clearly had n't been paying attention -- the collapse in Labour 's party vote had been clear for the past two months , and while there was a bit of a rally in the last week , it was too little , too late . So , we 're stuck with National and ACT -- and if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the clammy embrace of Winston , which means its chaos ahoy ! <p> Labour hacks are already blaming the Greens and Te Pati Maori , both of whom had a very good night , which just shows that the relic status quo party still does n't understand MMP . As a reminder , electorates do n't matter -- all that counts is the party vote . And the equation for the left there is that the Greens need to deliver 10% , and Labour 40% ( TPM and the wasted vote can fudge these numbers a bit , but that 's the basic shape of it ) . The Greens kept up their end . Labour did n't . This is their loss , and they need to own it , recognise why ( I 'd start with being a bunch of useless , uninspiring , status quo hacks ) , and most of all , fix it . But this being the Labour Party , I doubt that will happen . Instead , we 'll have three years of them deciding they need to be more centrist and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why does nobody like us ? " again . <p> Winners : Luxon -- he is the next PM . Simple , he won Peters -- back inside the tent despite everyone saying he would n't a couple of months back Greens -- by being less shit than Labour . Nz Indians -- evidently half an Indian is worth more than 3 Asians in the inner West of Auckland . <p> Losers Ardern -- this is your legacy Hipkins -- clearly middle NZ did n't warm to Richie Cunningham on meth during the debates Act -- Should be mid teens . At least . Wood -- from heir apparent to out of the game in less than 6 months . Likely the next mayor of Auckland if his ego can handle it . Mahuta -- overconfidence in the Iwi elite failed to translate into votes . Jackson -- Labour 's Maori vote just got hit where it hurts . Will he now defect to join his mate JT ? MSM media -- Campbell held back the tears , Jess wanted to punch somebody and I believe Cunliffe again apologised for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially if Peters or Jones is broadcasting Minister . <p> Willis and Bishop will have a crack at rolling Luxo I recks . Or Seemorebutt will have a hissy because he 's not the boss and does n't get his way and alienates himself causing a split and Winston will call him out ... <h> STAY CONNECTED <p> Launched on Friday 1 March , 2013 , the ' TheDailyBlog.co.nz ' unites New Zealand 's leading left/centre-left commentators and progressive opinion shapers to provide the other side of the story on today 's news , media and political agendas. 
@@102670234 <h> Chips falling : Election preliminaries , specials , scenarios . <p> As I began writing this the day after the general election ( 15/10/2023 ) it became apparent to the voters that NZ First will be needed in some capacity to support a presumptive National-Act government . This is , after all , what the voters wanted . Or at least it should be apparent . The last RNZ news bulletin I heard on Sunday night said National and Act would form government , Luxon is to be the next Prime Minister etc. oh but by the way NZ First might be needed , said as if it was a minor detail . ' T is no detail . This despite Luxon proclaiming victory at 11:20pm and Hipkins saying he had conceded to him by phone at about 10:00pm on Saturday . The suicidal ineptitude being played out on such a grand scale was infuriating and yet so predictable . What are you doing man ! ? <p> The whole campaign , indeed the whole government since Jacinda abandoned them , had been one slow act of falling on their sword , and last night Chippy pre-emptively completed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the battle was still going on and the other side had n't even won . An unprompted , unconditional surrender . Do n't try ; rather a drop kick of victory straight between the uprights of defeat to bring things to a tidy conclusion . A ginger drop kick indeed . Christ what a fucking loser . Is he just thick ? Not a hundred ? Is he even on our side ? Is he even on his own side ? Is he wrestling with the demon of meth addiction ? Help me understand . I could n't watch , I could n't meet his pained eyes on the three channels that were on when they all switched to this livestreamed untergang . Shameful . At least the lackadaisical Black Knight from the Holy Grail film had the dignity of having his enemy lop off each of his limbs in turn rather than cut them all off himself as he had done during the course of the entropic , doomed campaign . <p> He never expected he would be PM , he never quite knew how to be PM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , on Saturday night , he just gave up being PM , so he never should have been PM , should he . Not to overstate his gravitas , but he had looked like a maths or economics teacher bearing the visible anguish of being burdened with the role of Deputy Principal for a term . His team must have had little respect for him ; the open wholesale caucus and cabinet back-biting on the wealth tax proved this . Hipkins was a mistake in retrospect , albeit obvious enough and safe enough of a choice at the time , but Labour 's logic was once you 're locked into a fatal spiral you just have to keep swimming with the current because it 's easier to die that way . <p> And he picked up that phone and called that ballhead , happy-clappy , Rolex-bashing wannabe John Key and cucked himself , and he got on that stage and made that speech of total surrender in between announcements about a girlfriend , for fuck 's sake , and threw the whole party , the Labour movement , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopes of the beneficiaries and the working class under a fucking bus -- a NActional bus that he let Winston drive . Monumentally hopeless with the emphasis on mentally and less . Would any other Labour leader have given up like that -- hell no ! Mike Moore faced a similar predicament on election night 1993 and gave the mother of all speeches vowing never surrender . A man famed only for pretending to like sausage rolls and absent any recognisable personality was always incapable of such heights . Goeth the hour , goeth the man . <p> Winston was clearly delighted at the return of NZ First being well clear of the 5% threshold early on . But -- incredibly -- the ferry from Russel leaves at 10pm so he was forced to make his remarks at 9:30pm that had the tone of a concession , telling reporters on the way out his offer to help in any way possible if needed was an act of patriotism . Hold your horses rodeo man and hold your tickets punters -- the thing is not settled at all . <p> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big rugby game when the crowd become uninterested in the play and nothing is seeming to happen , a moment of atrophy . It is at these moments of inattention when things often turn decisively in a game precisely because they are unnoticed initially by the teams or the observers , fumbles occur . My twitter post records it was 9:54pm . A collective pause where people have the space to ruminate . Something did n't seem right . It was a silent period . All three streams same thing . Odd . Too quiet . What is occurring ? National began tanking , NZ First began rising , Labour started to claw back . A tidal shift in booths when reporting goes from rural to urban . I bet that was the minute when Mr Hipkins dialled Mr Luxon and proceeded to shit his pants and fuck it all up . Was he taking his own advice or Robertson 's ? The moment of death . Hope was killed -- sacrificed , for what ? <p> At 9:56pm Marama was beside James on the stage at Greens party central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointing and jabbing and chopping and flinging . Her earrings -- reputedly James ' gold-plated testicles -- were dancing around like poi as she railed against Versailles . I kept the sound off , she is yelling , clearly . I have no intention of listening to her spectrum-level pitchy assailment that does her no favours , it is embarrassing . The closest I can think of is Judith Collins during the TV debates with Jacinda going full hysteria and gasping and flailing and cackling like the Joker played by Caesar Romero in the original TV series . Ma has those vibes when she 's in full Fuhrer mode . Not a fan . James just stands there like the modern man must , to support , to affirm , to listen -- did he even get to speak ? Wellington is doubtlessly a hermetic bubble blowing around the rest of the country 's cash into the pockets of the conformist dolts of the capital creating a subsidised artificiality where the Greens prosper -- Wellington Central was predictable and Rongotai was a possibility , both turned Green with accompanying huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the middle-aged men on all three streams for who has the biggest , chunkiest fuck off black rimmed glasses . It 's like a Kenny Everett show every time you check back the glasses get bigger . By 10:12pm it emerged that Te Pati Maori 's massive landslide electorate votes may well cause an overhang . The movement in the Maori seats is substantial and signals a break with Labour and the effective rise of the next generation . Waititi 's thumping majority -- when he has barely been in the electorate ( ! ) -- foretold the mood was " unapologetically " for self-determination . Excitement . Trepidation . Rimmer arriving at 10:18pm . He would give his usual robotic speech , chastened as he has been in the last week of campaigning by sliding opinion polls coming home to roost after his speed wobbles caused by his own arrogance , race baiting and exposure of his weaker candidates . Brooke looked rouged , almost to the point of exhibiting human complexion and emotion , she was being coy but had beaten Godboy soundly to take Tamaki . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so they can hook up Rob 's spinning corpse to the grid . <p> TDB Recommends NewzEngine.com <p> Hooton was the first to twig on the dicey numbers at 10:20pm . My own forecast published on The Daily Blog on Election Eve gave National-Act only a 20% chance of a clean 2 party government -- every other realistic combo would definitely have NZ First included . It could well end up a hung parliament 60-60 ( or 61-61 ) . ( My forecasts and scenarios following the preliminary count on the night are as below ) . But five minutes later a deflated , shattered looking Hipkins arrived at the Labour wake and the count on screen has Labour at 26.3% and National at 40.2% . At 10:30pm I 'm on twitter begging Hipkins to wait another hour if he has to " Will Hipkins make his final bad call and chuck in the towel ? " You betcha. 10:37pm He said he rang Luxon to concede . 10:49pm Hipkins stops to hug Robertson on the way out , you ca n't see the dagger in Robbo 's hand but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the ZB drongos are musing with Hooton that maybe Hipkins should n't have conceded . And then , just to double down -- as this dumbbell has done every time -- Chumpkins starts popping up in each feed in sequence doing interviews which can only be to confirm that he has conceded , followed by awkward questions about his failings and future that he ca n't and wont answer . So , why the hell is he doing these fucking interviews ! ? Humiliating and pointless -- does he think this is somehow cathartic for himself , did Robbo advise him to do these rounds as well ? My God , man , you loser , get the fuck out of our faces you ginga drop kick loser -- how many times do I have to say it and you have to think it ? <p> Luxon had left what must have been his John Key copycat mansion just before 11pm . And so Luxon , his pre-melanomic head dusted in low sheen make up , sporting a glowing near iridescent blue tie , under the lights , moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the microphone at the downtown wharf of Nats party central and announces victory at 11:19pm . The chant of " National 's back ! " that went up had a hateful inflexion . <p> It was telling that on Newshub Nation the morning after the panel agreed Hipkins had to go and fast that when the host said who should take over there was silence . No names were mentioned , not Robertson , not Parker , no-one . There is no one . Bereft . <p> See -- National and Act will not have a majority based on what happened in 2017 . I am using that basis because 2020 was such an outlier . My forecast scenario is adjusted 2017 data taking into account NZ First surging and Act declining . The Maori Party may pick up more party votes eliminating the overhang . The three seats with Labour short by less than a hundred should go back to them on specials but this will not affect the overall result . It all hinges on NZ First . <p> Is it too late for Labour to approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mood of the Labour caucus ? Neil Jones on RNZ this morning advised Hipkins to stay on for six months -- keep taking his appalling advice some more why do n't they . Time to change . <h> 28 COMMENTS <p> The fact that we are even entertaining a Duckworth Lewis scenario after rain delay , shows you how fucked this form of MMP is . Pinch 0.3 here , add 0.0002 there , divide by 1.0345 and subtract 0.00001 . What kind of govt do you think you 'd get with Labour using that kind of system . The country just told them " we do n't want you anymore , fuck off " . And there you go trying to find an Einstein Calculation to force the same shit show back onto us poor citizens . Enough ! Go away now Labour . <p> Not the country 39% of the country . Our country is very divided . Seymore got 8.9% yet he wants to redefine the TOW Not exactly a overwhelming majority to make something so significant insignificant . And if we do a break down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good for us as a country or public relations . Social cohesion is non existent people want change but change will take a very long time and come at a costs . Many NZers have become very selfish and it 's sad for us as a country . <p> If there 's one good thing about the enduring disease that 's roger douglas 's neo-liberalism it 's that all our political parties have it so no risk then of catching it . We can discuss the in 's out 's of the mythologies of AO/NZ 's different political leanings until the polluting cow comes home to shit on the carpet roger 's swept our economy under because that 's where roger 's cock-roach accomplices slither about as they move money from there to further over there . I 'm going to ask this one question . Let 's see who has the correct answer . Of the 14 Aotearoa/New Zealand multi-billionaires , the 3118 multi-millionaires with a minimum of $50 mil each and the four now foreign owned banks stealing , or perhaps more defrauding , $180.00 a second out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? A farmer who farms exclusively and only for his/her/they/them 's income ? As a farmer who provided AO/NZ with its PRIMARY industry finances . The reason I ask is because #A . I 'm a farmer and I do n't have $millions much less the all but mythical $Billions and yet a once was panel beater and tow truck operator , graeme hart has 14 of the billions ? #B Should I ask ? How ? He says he can smell money . I say I smell the bull shit coming out of the bull that 's fucked aforementioned cow that 's yet to come FUCKING home . #C How come we never talk about who earns our money , ever , and #D how does that money mysteriously disappear between the consumer and the farmer who farms that which we ship then sell ? # E Where the fuck is our money ? # F For Fucks Fucking Sake ! Where the fuck is our primary industry money ? Less than .70cents worth of wool becomes a $200 jersey ! A bale of exported wool goes all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house in Herne Bay which the banks will launder via the home owner which will then return billions of dollars to everyone except the sheep farmers who 's sheep grew the stuff but wait , there 's more . Those sheep-farmer farmers are broke as fuck and have to , you guessed it , borrow money from the same banks that broker dirty deals with the same wool . Is that a double-bubble of what ? #G A lot of money is disappeared between the woolshed and the carpeted plasti-mansions with views of a shitty , rattly , ugly bridge and a polluted , muddy swamp . Aye Boys ? You had a blubbering little twit and now you have Psycho-Baldylocks who 's soon to be in bed with a Pink Twerker and there 's a vast crime happening right under our noses . Honestly , you could n't invent this shit . While swollen farmers drive their tractors around in small circles then slink home to service bankster debts there , are in the cities , people who are not farmers buying Ferrari 's for half a million . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own shoelaces and are in grieving at the election outcome , then here 's a word or two of comfort for your little selves . National ? Labour ? The same fuckin ' thing man . <p> Talk about self preservation , captain Chippy ran for the lifeboats before the women and children , and the ship was n't even sinking . And we have everyone congratulating National for their victory before the votes are even counted , including Elon Musk , which could be interpreted as foreign interference in our election . Musk is not just another social media influencer or businessman . He is n't just another elite grooming fanboys or another tycoon filling land and space with junk in the name of progress , he has intimate ties to the security state , he has provided technology for foreign armies and he has said " America will coup who they want to coup " . He has to be considered part of the American State apparatus and one which could have influenced the negotiations between New Zealand political party 's if negotiations are needed . <p> Clutching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly form a Govt when the specials are counted ? 500k all for Labour you reckon ? There will be no ' left ' majority in those specials after what Labour ( Chippy and Ardern ) did with the NZ population Covid blockade . ( Although DJs and entertainers could come and go as they pleased it seems ) <p> Labour , Greens , Maori Party , all in opposition ...... thumb twiddlers , ...... it will be interesting to see how many companies from the media , print and broadcasting , will still be around in the next 3 years , unemployed gravy train drivers all gone , the unemployment lines will be an interesting and fruity mix of overheads , some ex university hangers on , some ex government paper shufflers , ..... the young , uneducated , unskilled youth might have some competition from this new lot for the McDonald 's type jobs .... <p> Why do you think the public servants were so keen on Robertsons ' unemployment tax ' ? So they could take a 6-8mth break when they get made redundant , not now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till they find another job , same as the bloody rest of NZ has to do when we were all made redundant at some stage in our working lives . <p> Really In Vino , you ca n't be that stupid , almost everyone who posts here either have had redundancy or it 's already part of their work contract ..... If you work for a Govt dept , a bank , almost every company of a reasonable size to the huge ones in NZ , ALL have redundancy as part of their contracts . How much depends on the company but usual is 3-4 weeks for year 1 then either 2-3 weeks for every year worked thereafter . Some companies limit it to either 26 weeks some 52 weeks and others it just keeps adding up . Are you ignorant of how contracts work , have you never worked In Vino ? <p> It all became so complicated . We had the Luxon fan girls wetting their pants on live TV . We had the fan boys calling it a victory at 7pm what did they call it " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was none so sad to see as Chris Hipkins all on his own on that stage , however he was taking full responsibility for the loss . Remember not one day as PM there was the Auckland flooding and cyclone Gabrielle , I defy anyone to come out of that unscathed . Then he had his ministers running amok all over the show . Surely they must take some responsibility for this debacle . Then of course the collective misinformation from the media from day one of the Labour government in 2017 . They were relentless in their criticism especially during covid . History will show how dangerous they were at this time with their inane rhetoric , questioning and nitpicking on a scale never seen before . Aided and abetted by this collection of NACT politicians we now have to try and run this country . The next few months will be telling , but I have a bit of advice for Luxon he may want to run this country like a CEO but I ai n't one of his employees . <p> Ahhh Queeny , running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't vote for Ardern but had to suck it up that she got to be anointed by Winnie in 2017 and won out right in 2020 , the majority voted and alliances via MMP made , it 's how politics work in NZ . The difference with me and you is I did n't fucking moan and cry about it like you apparently will for the next 3 years ( more likely 9 ! ) How old are you , 12 ? <p> True I 'm right who is in charge does not effect me but coming from a business background sometime as an employee sometimes as an employer I hated to see the way the country was being run.The waste of money , the racism , the lack of law and order , inflation caused by poor policy so many thinks that need to be brought back into line and we now have the team to do it . I <p> I keep telling the likes of " Queeny " that if the MSM were as right-wing as she claims , or even slightly right-wing , Righties like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and listening to them . <p> But we 're not . We want them to die . The only Righties who do n't are the 65+ crowd who ca n't change after a lifetime of switching on the news at 6pm . <p> You got that right queeny , that Bald fucker Luxon was despised by his Employees at Air when he was CEO , apparently he was a right arsehole when it came to wage increases &amp; then when he left that Company , Air NZ was $33 billion in debt , which required a nearly $1 billion dollar Taxpayer bailout , but old Baldrick left with his $4.2 million Salary &amp; bonuses as reward for nearly bankrupting Air NZ ! What a prick &amp; now he 's in charge of NZ &amp; its Finances , we are truly fucked with this arsehole in charge ? <p> You have 121 seats in your scenarios . There are already 121 because of the overhang from the Maori seats . Then there will be an extra from the by-election. so shoudl be 122 total ? You also have Nats losing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What happened to the other seat ? Or does one seat go away somehow ? <p> Oooh Jody Labour have ruled out working with Labour ... NZ1st ruled out working with Labour . Now tell me which of the below is not fact ? Oh you may not like it , hate it in fact , but which one is incorrect ? ! <p> Always enjoy your columns Tim but on this one , I have to say -Of course , it 's too late to get a deal out of Winston ! <p> Maybe if Chippie had nt used the " I 'll not work with Winston " lever but he screwed the pooch ( and I thought this at the time ) because Winnie does nt like to be screwed over and Winnie likes to prove he can run rings around others . <p> But more to the point , this is Winston 's legacy election so he will not be pushed off the scent trail of a few issues he sees as vital to NZs future . At 78 years old and the country in tatters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money with him but he can leave behind a legacy ( in his eyes ) . <p> Really ? You still think NZ First might go with Labour ?

@@102670235 <p> Ukraine spent last week battling hard , on the frontline its forces are bogged down in intense fighting and facing new Russian attacks . Ukraine 's key strategic issue remains keeping the attention of its international supporters a tougher task now that world media attention is focussed on Gaza . Ukraine relies on ammunition , equipment and money from other countries to continue its war against a much larger enemy . Recent slow progress in the land campaign inevitably leads to questions about the effectiveness of the billions of dollars of aid provided to Ukraine . <p> Ukraine is trying to manage the risk of losing international support by generating income from grain exports . Controlling the western Black Sea is important for Ukraine because it provides safe access for grain shipments that will deliver essential income . Last week , Ukraine continued to focus on this objective attacking another two Russian warships . The small patrol vessel Pavel Derzhavin on 11 October and Buyan a missile armed corvette on 13 October . It has been confirmed that Pavel Derzhavin was damaged and needs repairs . This ship is a stealthy and modern vessel that was hit near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , demonstrates both Ukraine 's technical capabilities and how useful the Boyak Towers are for surveillance and targeting . The attacks are further evidence that Ukraine controls the western Black Sea . A situation causing Russia considerable concern because of the options to attack Crimea or the south-west Kherson coast it gives Ukraine . <p> Evidence that Russia is worried was reported by the Institute for the Study of War , on 13 October . The Institute reporting movement of Russian troops from reserve positions into south-west Kherson to defend against an attack over the Dnipro River or from the coast . The Institute referenced Ukrainian analyst Kostyantyn Mashovets , reporting that he believes " ... that the Russian military command is adjusting its posture in the Kherson and Crimea directions in response to concerns about the possibility of a large-scale Ukrainian crossing of the Dnipro River and the development of Ukrainian offensive operations targeting Crimea . " The chances of Ukraine crossing the Dnipro River in large numbers is low . However , Ukraine 's increasing control of the Black Sea may contribute to Russian fears of an attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Zaporizhia frontline into south-west Kherson raises an important question . If Russia 's defences are as stretched as reported , how can Russia justify deploying resources for this task ? Russia either very firmly believes Ukraine intends to open a new front by crossing the Dnipro River . Or , conversely it could mean that Russia is sufficiently in control of the situation that they feel safe moving troops from contested areas to south-western Kherson . It is a very interesting situation and worth keeping a close eye on , especially considering recent changes in the ground battle . <p> On land , Ukraine started last week continuing to concentrate on two key axes of advance : <p> A southern axis starting from near Orikhiv and pushing south towards Tokmak and Melitopol . This is the most important axis and is likely to be Ukraine 's main effort . <p> Advancing on Bakhmut , an offensive that is probably designed to hold Russian forces in this area , often called a ' fixing ' operation because it prevents Russia moving troops from Bakhmut to defend in the south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting hard to ' break into ' Novoprokopivka and Verbove . Russia has managed to concentrate some of its strongest units in this on this axis and is reported to be successfully rotating forces in this area , allowing its soldiers to rest , re-arm and recuperate . The fighting is now in urban areas so combat is intense . Even small villages are difficult targets that are easy to defend . This week , regardless of Ukraine 's best efforts there has been no forward movement on this axis . Nor has Ukraine been able to expand the width of its salient by pushing either west toward Kopani or east toward Verbove . <p> Further east , Ukraine 's operations around Bakhmut have been more successful . Ukraine advancing east about 1-1.5 kilometres on a six-kilometre frontage . The contested area shown on Deep State 's map ( below ) shows that it is possible Ukraine has pushed Russian forces back from the defensive line they had established on the rail line that supplies Bakhmut from the south . Railway embankments provide a useful obstacle to movement and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raises is : Where next ? North toward Bakhmut ; or east towards Optyne ? <p> TDB Recommends NewzEngine.com <p> If Ukraine captures Optyne , to the east , it means they will control Russian access to the area on the T0513 Highway a major supply route for Russia 's soldiers in Bakhmut . Getting to Optyne though requires crossing several small water courses and boggy ground before advancing uphill to take the town . The other option , advancing north to Bakhmut may be an easier task , involving an advance on a gentle downhill slope towards the city . <p> Later in the week , there was an increase in Russian activity with attacks launched along most of the front line . Most were small and easily defeated . The largest is a surprise attack on the Avdiivka salient ( see the map below ) . The attack started on 11 October with offensives from both the north and south flanks of the Ukrainian salient . Fighting continues and although Russian forces made some small gains in the north they were generally pushed back and , in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Russian military blogging community . The bloggers upset by another failed Russian attack . <p> The operation started just after the Hamas attack on Israel and may be part of a larger Russian information operation designed to undermine confidence in Ukraine while the world 's attention is diverted . The Institute for the Study of War , assessing on 13 September that " The Kremlin is likely attempting to frame Russian offensive operations around Avdiivka and other localized efforts as Russian forces seizing the operational initiative in Ukraine . " <p> Reviewing the land campaign , it seems safe to conclude that Russia feels comfortable that it can hold Ukraine on the Orikhiv Axis . Evidence being the movement of forces west to defend south-west Kherson and Crimea and the large commitment of troops to the Aviidivka operation . Both of which indicate a level of confidence that Ukraine 's offensive in the south can be held . However , the Institute for the Study of War is probably correct that Russia 's attacks , including the Aviidivka operation are also about demonstrating that Ukraine has lost operational initiative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ukraine is supporting a lost cause . <p> In the United States there is already tension amongst policy makers about the $ 44 billion invested in the war to date and even though , Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin announced another $ 200 million on 11 October the tension will increase . A presidential election is fast approaching and there are candidates for whom the investment in Ukraine is an example of the United States paying for other people 's wars . Arguing that European nations should pay for the defence of Europe rather than it being subsidised by the United States . If Ukraine is not demonstrably ' winning ' these arguments gain traction . <p> Russia 's United Nations representative , Vasily Nebenzia contributed to this narrative stating that " Russian troops have , for several days now , switched over to active combat action practically throughout the entire frontline " and that " The so-called Ukrainian counteroffensive can therefore be considered finished . " Nebenzia 's statement is clearly propaganda , the offensive is contained to a relatively small area of the front and to date is far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spokesperson admitted that the Russian attack on Aviidivka was a new offensive but was confident that Ukraine would defeat it . Kirby and his administration will be worried about the effects of this discussion on forthcoming United State budget debates . <p> Further , Nebenzia 's statements fly-in the face of Ukrainian information stating that the average number of artillery shells fired by Ukraine each day has surpassed the number fired by Russia for the first time in the war . Consumption of artillery ammunition is an important combat indicator , one that in this case suggests Russia 's capacity is reducing and while Ukraine 's is increasing . A result that should not be surprising because Russia used enormous quantities of shells to demolish Ukraine 's cities early in the war . Shells that came from war stocks and can not be replaced easily because Russia 's manufacturing capacity is too small . Even with supplies from North Korea , Russia will struggle to match the capacity of Ukraine 's supporters . If this is correct , it may be that the Aviidivka operation is not inspired by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperate need to reduce support from the United States and its allies by presenting the narrative that Ukraine 's offensive is beaten and a new Russian offensive is starting . <p> In summary , last week was full of interesting and contradictory activity that raises questions about the land campaign . Perhaps Russia is confident that Ukraine 's southern thrust is defeated , so can risk starting offensives and moving troops to cover a highly unlikely axis of attack from across the Dnipro River . Or , maybe the Russian 's have good reason to be worried and the Ukrainians do have options for attacking Crimea or for crossing the Dnipro River , that are not public yet but that scare the Russians enough to risk taking troops from the frontline . Meanwhile , we can be sure that Russia is preparing for the winter , NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg noting this week that Russia is " preparing once again to use winter as a weapon of war " highlighting NATO 's expectation that Ukraine 's power infra-structure will again be targeted by Russia . Further we can assume that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no matter how much resource they provide the war will go on forever , that Russia will not give up . A powerful information operation fought by covert social media campaigns , media releases , political statements and that shapes operations in the campaign . By taking the offensive last week Russia contributes to telling this story , reinforcing propaganda with activity on the ground . Selling the story that Ukraine has culminated and now Russia will strike back , demonstrating that the support provided to Ukraine is not working . A narrative that the world can not afford to let become the truth . <p> Again , with this " reinforcing the narrative " bull-puckky . People are not being blasted to hell by heavy metal weapon systems to " create a narrative " . They are being blasted to hell . The Western punditocracy seems to literally gone insane with the belief that reality is just created by the stories we tell about it , as if tanks , soldiers , guns and ammunition can be summoned into existence by speaking the right words and waving your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you really think that Ukraine is outshooting Russian artillery then you would be able to do a deep dive into the numbers with a What , When and How Many to show how that is true or at least plausible . The figure of $44b spent is clearly wrong . The Washington Post says $60b in aid with $43b being military . The Kiel institute says the USA has spent $73.2b . CNN says $113b has been pledged by America , so that is n't going anywhere else unless it 's to Israel . Total war funding including the EU and other nations was around $150b as of January and that was 9 months ago . All those figures are likely to be major underestimates as there are many ways to keep figures off the books and wrecked equipment will have to be replaced and paid for at replacement prices while there is a big military supply crunch going on . Finally this is a good bit ; " A powerful information operation fought by covert social media campaigns , media releases , political statements and that shapes operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out which side this was referring to . Information campaigns fought by political statements in social media is done by the bad guys , right ? And the bad guys are those foreigners over there who talk funny and wear black hats , right ? While we , the good guys who talk proper English and stand over here wearing white hats , only ever do accurate unbiased public information campaigns . <p> Stop watching nonsnse MSM and use your brain . Russia clearly never had designs to overthrow Kiev and/or the Zelsnky regime -- none of their military actions can be contrued as that being the Russian end-game . They have ( to date ) still not even declared formal war on Ukraine ! The operational goal was always ( and Putin has never claimed differently ) to create a Russian controlled " buffer zone " between Ukraine and Russia . Looks pretty much " mission accomplished " to me . The Russians are now dug-in and will from her on out attempt to defend the occupied territory until they can come to some sort of **32;351;TOOLONG ( whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> to create a Russian controlled " buffer zone " between Ukraine and Russia . <p> Ah ! That 's why they sent a huge military column down the highway to Kiev and Putin 's crony 's and TV worshippers were gleeful that Zelensky and his family would soon be on a plane out of the country -- until it all stalled , got shot up and then turned back to Mother Russia <p> For a guy who 's just a blog commentator you sure do sound like a Putin shill . Why ? You could make perfectly reasonable arguments about a likely truce or peace treaty that sees the Russians left in control of those " disputed " areas , as you say . <p> So why all this pathetic bullshit claiming that Putin has n't fucked up when he so clearly did in overreaching in his initial invasion ? <p> Yes , they attacked on multiple fronts , including Kiev to fix the Ukrainians while they secured their objectives ( yay , I sound like Ben ! ) . And they did , including a peace deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And then gave them a second army . Now onto their third , etc . <p> Wrong Nitrium ! Have you got a hot line to the Kremlin or something ? Putin intended to decapitate the Kyiv government and substitute his mate Medvedchuk as puppet leader , and then unleash the FSB on all traitors to Russia -- the same so-called Ukrainian ' Nazis ' who of course do n't exist and never existed . Because the spetznaz raid on Gostomel airport was a failure , the decapitation of Zelensky and his government never happened . You know zilch Nitrium and do n't pretend otherwise ! <p> Andrew , we 'd better hope to hell that report is wrong or it means death to press ganged 16 year olds and 40+ year olds .

@@102670238 <h> GUEST BLOG : Jackie Foster -- SOCIAL JUSTICE AOTEAROA IPCA POLICY <p> Social Justice Aotearoa will ensure New Zealand has a just , civil , and transparent police force by advocating for the Independent Police Complaints Authority to be Headed by an independent suitably qualified person from another commonwealth country such as Australia , Canada , or the United Kingdom . <p> For SJA and , I believe , the whole of New Zealand having an independent governing body of the New Zealand Police is not only democratic but vital . <p> In New Zealand the IPCA has ex police officers employed whom carry out investigations into public accusations of wrongful policing among other investigations of policing and oversite . <p> I ask a very simple question , " How can any investigation be independent when ex police officers are doing the investigations ? And the head of the IPCA , Judge Kenneth Johnston KC , whole career has been involved with policing . <p> I do not question Judge Johnstons creditability , but I do question how he will change an IPCA that has been questionable virtually since its inception some thirty-four years ago . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year she questioned the integrity of the IPCA when she asked why , on average , only 2% of all cases referred to the IPCA , are investigated . <p> Would n't it be a public expectation that every case or complaint referred to the IPCA is investigated ? For SJA the answer must be yes . <p> Vision <p> TDB Recommends NewzEngine.com <p> The Police are there to protect the citizens of New Zealand and fairly enforce the laws of our land in an open , honest , and transparent way . <p> This is all we are asking for and our police practises are all too often being brought into question . <p> The public of New Zealand should have faith in our police and more importantly feel assured that our police are independently overseen . <p> Should any police practise or action be legitimately brought into question there must be a full and independent investigation into all allegations . <p> SJA will always stand beside this statement and will advocate for this until it is achieved also advocating for an independent enquiry with honest and independent results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person who is not a citizen of New Zealand and has no connection to New Zealand or any government department . This was done in the Arthor Allan Thomas inquiry where R. L. Taylor , a former Justice of the Supreme Court of New South Wales headed that inquiry . To achieve this the current head of the IPCA would need to be replaced . <p> Values and Principles <p> That no person that has been employed in any capacity by the New Zealand police can be employed or contracted to work for the IPCA , which we believe makes the governing body overseeing the New Zealand Police totally independent . <p> Should any police practise or action be legitimately brought into question there must be a full and independent investigation into all allegations . <p> Everyone is entitled to justice , to a fair hearing , and to be treated with respect in the justice system including within any investigation within the Independent Police Complaints Authority . <p> The rule of law and judicial independence are fundamental values that should be protected ; justice should follow transparent and fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protected in all its forms including within all activities and investigations the Independent Police Complaints Authority are involved in . <p> International public law obligations should be fairly and openly honoured and respected by the Independent Police Complaints Authority . <p> We will ensure that everyone before the Independent Police Complaints Authority , at any stage of the process , regardless of gender , race , origin , or financial status , is treated equally , accorded due process , and without any limitation on their right to the truth . <p> Our aim <p> To create a totally independent body whom the public can trust to oversee any policing concerns/complaints that arise . <p> The IPCA is a joke . An ex policeman turned defence barrister once opined to me that the police has no fear of it or respect for it at all in its role as watchdog , except for the the most serious and egregious cases of misconduct . Routine petty police corruption , such as lying in court about defendant statements and behaviour , the massaging , suppression or manufacturing of evidence and testimony , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- these all fly by with a nod and wink from the IPCA , because , you know , one of the justifications given for keeping it essentially in police hands has been to take advantage of the investigative experience and knowledge of police culture and of the procedures that the police themselves possess . In other words , to take advantage of the large degree of empathy with the challenges that police face , and , perhaps , their need to sometimes bend the rules for results . Anybody who thinks this current system is n't heavily skewed to advantage the police is dishonest or blind . <p> I do not understand why police members involved in the many miscarriages of justice cases in New Zealand do not receive some form of punishment . Sometimes the victim of that police/prosecution mistake gets a payout but only after a massive effort . The government often spends millions on court cases etc yet those who caused that wasted expenditure are not asked for any reimbursement of the cost their actions caused . <p> Great policy , well written and very clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have , is now that we have a right wing punitive government with the addition of Winston , there will be very little support for constructive change . if SJA can get a review done and get independency of the IPCA it will be a huge achievement .

@@102893232 <p> Russia continues fighting hard to encircle Avdiivka . Ukraine 's new long-range ATACMS missiles supplied by the United States make an impact and a surprisingly large Ukrainian crossing of the Dnipro River all indicate that the war in Ukraine remains intense and is far from slowing down . The big question this week is if Russia has weathered Ukraine 's offensive or if Ukraine still has some fight left . <p> Last column , we discussed the increase in Russia 's offensive activity across the entire frontline , a trend that continues . Since the last column , Russia has maintained continuous small counter attacks along the whole front line . It is also still committed to a large offensive operation aimed at capturing the Avdiivka Salient . Pushing from both the north and south Russian forces started trying to encircle the town of Adviivka on 10 October , and intense fighting continues . <p> This operation is the largest Russian attack since the failed attack on Vuledhar in February and involves roughly brigade sized attacks , about 2-3000 soldiers supported by a couple of hundred tanks and armoured vehicles advancing from each flank . <p> However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to capture in its 2014 invasion and has since been heavily fortified . So far , the Russian offensive has been unsuccessful making incremental progress in exchange for very heavy casualties . Avdiivka is important because it is only about 12 km from the major city of Donetsk , the main administrative centre of the Russian backed Donetsk People 's Republic . Further , its capture would allow Russia to close the salient and reduce the length of frontline that it needs to defend . Unlike Bakhmut , there are sound strategic reasons for trying to capture this town , especially if Russia is looking towards securing a possible future border for a ' Donetsk Oblast . ' <p> Meanwhile , Ukraine continues to maintain pressure on both its key axes of advance . The Orikhiv Axis in the south-west , aiming towards the major transport centre at Tokmak , and fighting to surround Bakhmut in the north-east . However , despite Ukraine 's efforts neither axis saw any significant changes in the frontline . Last week was also notable for the first use of the new Army Tactical Missile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large , long-range , precision-guided missile that is fired from a HIMARS or MLRS vehicle . ATACMS missiles were recently supplied to Ukraine by the United States . The missiles supplied to Ukraine are older M39 models with a range of 160km so can strike targets deep behind the frontline . Ukraine has requested ATACMS for a long time but it was not until August this year that the United States supplied these long-range weapons because of concerns that they could be used to attack targets deep inside Russia , potentially escalating the war . <p> Ukraine does not possess a significant aviation capability because many of its planes were destroyed early in the war . ATACMS fills an important capability gap for Ukraine , in that it can attack pin-point targets with a warhead roughly the same size as an aircraft bomb . An M39 ATACMs carries 950 submunitions in its warhead , so each missile has a destructive capability similar to an airstrike with a cluster bomb . <p> On 17 October , ATACMS was used to strike Russian attack helicopters based at Berdyansk on the coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fighting on the Orikhiv Salient , is home to many of the advanced Russian attack helicopters supporting the battle . Ukraine 's Special Operations Forces claimed that the attack destroyed nine attack helicopters and an air defence missile launcher . There were also ATACMS attacks reported in Luhansk . If the reports are correct , losing nine attack helicopters is a significant blow to Russian combat power defending Tokmak . Ukrainian forces fighting on the Orikhiv axis report that Russian attack helicopters have been very effective against their armoured forces . Losing nine expensive and hard to replace attack helicopters is a big blow . <p> TDB Recommends NewzEngine.com <p> The biggest impact of this strike is not the loss of these helicopters . Instead , it is the indirect effect that it has on Russian logistics and battlefield aviation availability . The attack on Berdyansk demonstrated a new Ukrainian capability and Russia needs to respond . ATACMs range is sufficient to hit targets anywhere on the Crimean Land Bridge or in the north of Crimea . This means that Russia must decide either to base its attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operational areas or to disperse and hide their attack helicopters . Longer flight times means less time over the battlefield but still being able to operate from a small number of bases at which fuel , weapons and tech support can be centralised . If Russia chooses to disperse its attack helicopters they will need to disperse to many small bases across Kherson and southern Zaporizhia . Imagine how much more difficult it is going to be to support the attack helicopter fleet when it is broken down into small groups of 2-3 helicopters hidden across a vast area . Especially , when Russia 's truck fleet is already stretched . <p> Potentially , the biggest news this week though is Ukraine 's crossing of the Dnipro River . Soldiers from the 35th and 36th Marine Infantry Brigades crossed the river just north of the Antonivskiy Bridge on 18 October . The latest reports indicate the force has a strength of roughly two companies or 200-250 light infantry soldiers , whose artillery and air defence support will be provided by forces on the west bank of the river . Ukraine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , this is a larger force , that is reported to be ' digging in ' indicating that they intend to stay . Additionally , Russian sources report that the force has electronic warfare and equipment , another indication that they are intending to hold ground in the area . <p> Further up the Dnipro there are also reports of another crossing near the village of Krynky . However , these have not yet been substantiated . The river crossings are an interesting operation , clearly designed to threaten the and T2206 and E57 highways that are essential to Russia 's supply lines in their part of Kherson Oblast . It is also possible that this operation is the start of a larger crossing . In last week 's column we noted the movement of Russian troops west , towards the Dnipro River . This week there are Russian reports of troops moving from reserve positions near Mariupol to reinforce this flank . So , it is likely that the Russians are concerned about a large crossing and are taking steps to mitigate that concern . But is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> On 21 October , the Institute for the Study of War observed that " Russian forces are struggling to interdict Ukrainian efforts to supply and reinforce newly captured positions on the east ( left ) bank of Kherson Oblast . " Essentially , the Ukrainian 's have now been on the east bank of the river for four days and nights which indicates that despite Russian air and ground attacks supplies are getting across the river . Perhaps , this is a foothold that Ukraine intends to expand , probably to divert Russian forces away from Orikhiv . Although , two factors may indicate that there are bigger plans afoot . Russia 's slow response to the crossing tells us that their forces are under pressure in this area . Secondly , the crossing is at a relatively crossable point on the river and has two damaged bridges the remains of which could be used to help build improvised crossing points . At this stage it is impossible to tell but next week 's activities will tell us more . <p> Overall , last week 's activity raises some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially about Russia 's level of capability and intent . Russian rates of activity remain high and even in their most recent update on 21 October the Institute for the Study of War reported that " Russian forces continued offensive operations along the **25;551;TOOLONG line , near Bakhmut , near Avdiivka , southwest of Donetsk City , in the Donetsk-Zaporizhia Oblast border area , and in western Zaporizhia Oblast and advanced in various sectors of the front . " Although , most of this activity is small when it is combined with the large operation near Avdiivka it is indicative of either confidence or foolhardiness . <p> At this stage , I am erring towards confidence . Ukraine 's progress on its main axes of advance is slowing down or perhaps has culminated . Russia , appears to be holding the line in Zaporizhia so has launched the Avdiivka operation to settle unfinished business from previous invasions . My assessment is that the Russians are planning ahead , looking at the strategic situation and focussing on settling defensible post war boundaries . Hence , the operation to close the Avdiivka @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year . Putin knows that he can hold what he has gained and rather than burning his political capital is going to focus on the endgame . <p> He knows that in America , funding for the war is being challenged in Congress and that long-term United States support is far from guaranteed , especially now that Israel requires support . Putin 's long game is his own survival and fighting to the death to take all of Ukraine is not expedient when he currently holds the Crimean Land Bridge , Donetsk and Luhansk . He has gained territory that secures Crimea , justifying the war . If he can keep holding on , and funding from the United States reduces or stops , Ukraine will be under considerable pressure to negotiate . Putin 's forces are now sitting on a well-tested defensive line that is likely to be the new border . My assessment is that Putin is more than willing to settle into a negotiated peace , on the current boundaries , and start a long slow war of attrition against Ukraine , just like he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next opportunity . Being able to play the ' long game ' is a distinct advantage of autocracy . <p> In summary , the strategic situation is conspiring against Ukraine and its only options are decisive action . Ukraine needs to demonstrate that it can achieve victory on land to retain the confidence of its supporters and allies . My assessment is that Russia has stopped Ukraine 's current offensives at Orikhiv and Bakhmut . So , Ukraine is now casting around for other options and crossing the Dnipro is a risky option that has been kept ' on the back burner ' as a contingency plan . While it is unlikely that Ukraine can get sufficient tanks , armoured vehicles and supply trucks across the river to attack Crimea , it may be possible that they can create enough of a threat that Russia diverts forces from its Zaporizhian defences that Ukraine is able to advance on the Orikhiv axis . If this happens Ukraine may produce the victory that it needs this year . <p> So you think that any aid should go to Putin then ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad view that it has clouded your judgment . I happen to agree with the USA bad view but do not see anything in Russia under Putin that inspires me to trust him . Luckily I have extra knowledge of how the end times will progress so I can trust in a better future . <p> This is a war that was originally precipitated by Biden ( by his domestic policy of attacking oil &amp; gas companies , thus driving up the price of energy worldwide ) and extended by Biden because he dithered in supplying the Ukraine government with the weapons they needed to defend themselves . Similarly , the conflict in Israel was precipitated by Biden 's appeasement policy with Iran . Two wars in one presidency -- that 's incompetence beyond belief , even for the Americans ! <p> Seriously Ovod you are becoming a " disinformation influencer " what with the amount of bovine byproducts you spew out . You should be praying to whatever invisible being you believe in because I guarantee the alternative to Putin will be worse . <p> The Avdiivka salient is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the Terrikon , albeit killing nearly enough ruzzian vehicles in the process to build a second one . Expect strenuous efforts to secure that high ground from both sides over the next few days . <p> 17 ATACMS were fired , 14 were shot down by the Russians &amp; 3 managed to get through because the Russian Air defence was n't configured against a new missile which they now have been after this dumb attack which accomplished nothing but destroying a couple of Helicopters ? Has this changed the outcome of this War , NO ! Zelensky went big in this attack that was a big dud , to try &amp; engage his Western Backers but they are done with Ukraine &amp; moved on to Israel ? Ukraine is yesterday 's news &amp; todays Fish &amp; Chip newspaper wrapper ! <p> Russia does n't want to close the cauldron around Avdiivka , just use this as another meat grinder for as long as AFU keeps sending reinforcements .

@@102893233 <h> Disinformation from the Left <p> DISINFORMATION has been part and parcel of the political process since , well , forever . It was only in the Nineteenth Century , however , that the need to create narratives advantageous to one 's own cause , and disadvantageous to one 's opponents , gained access to technologies enabling disinformation to be communicated at great speed and on a massive scale . With the dawning of the Twentieth Century , however , even more startling technological innovations upped the effectiveness of disinformation by several orders of magnitude . The old adage : " A lie will be halfway around the world before Truth has pulled his boots on " ; became a straightforward description of reality . By the Twenty-First Century , however , technology had advanced to the point where the separation of truth from falsehood required the adjudication of experts -- and the ability to distinguish fake expertise from the real thing . <p> When people talk about disinformation today , it is almost always from within a left-wing narrative framework . The villains behind the disinformation tsunami allegedly inundating the civilised world are identified as white supremacists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In normal circumstances , the pet hates of leftists do n't carry very much weight . Tragically , however , the life of the world stopped being normal in January 2020 , as it became clear that a novel coronavirus -- Covid-19 -- was about to ignite a global pandemic . Fearful that the small but very vocal clusters of anti-vaccination zealots , located in just about all Western nations , would undermine the public health and immunological measures vital to fighting the virus , public servants began establishing anti-disinformation units to identify and counter the lies being spread about Covid-19 , and , more importantly , the vaccines developed in record time to bring it under control . <p> In those countries with centre-left national and/or state governments , most particularly the USA , Canada , Australia and New Zealand , politicians and activists moved swiftly to extend the brief of these disinformation units to encompass just about all of the Left 's pet hates . The situation was not improved by the intervention of national security agencies alarmed at the volume of Russian and Chinese disinformation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspective of the Left , this conflation of Far-Right disinformation with the disinformation emanating from authoritarian nation states would prove to be enormously helpful . A pro-censorship position , which at least some of the mainstream media might have challenged , could now be presented as a matter of national security . In New Zealand , willingness to buy into this aspect of the anti-disinformation project was aided by the still raw memories of the Christchurch Mosque Massacres . Far-Right lies could produce deadly consequences , argued the Left . Free speech should not be considered an unqualified good , not when it empowers " bad actors " . <p> What the New Zealand Left -- notoriously ignorant of its own , and the international movement 's history -- finds it almost impossible to accept is that disinformation ( or , as it was once , more honestly , known : " propaganda " ) was , and is , every bit as rampant on the revolutionary left , as it was , and is , on the reactionary right . Indeed , modern **25;578;TOOLONG was more-or-less invented by Willi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Communist International to spread the Bolshevik 's revolutionary creed across the West . Tactics we take for granted today : front organisations , activist celebrities , newspapers , magazines , plays , movies , and phonograph records -- all with an easily digestible political sub-text , were M ? nzenberg 's inventions . In the early 1920s , the Right had nothing to match " Willi 's Wurlitzer " . <p> Not that the state-subsidised Disinformation Project would ever acknowledge the fact , but the effectiveness of New Zealand 's right-wing disinformers is well below that of their left-wing rivals . Better educated , more articulate , technically more proficient , and -- most importantly -- working with , not against , the grain of New Zealand 's official " progressive " ideology , New Zealand 's left-wing activists ' political and cultural production throws that of the Right into the shade .

Operating freely , under their own names , they have ready access to the hearts and minds of millions . <p> Not that very many New Zealanders know or care what the Left is saying . Indeed , political speech only becomes important in moments of national and international crisis . In the middle of a global pandemic , disinformation is important . When Russia invades Ukraine , disinformation is important . When Hamas unleashes terror in Southern Israel , and the State of Israel unleashes hell in retaliation , disinformation is important . Which is why , by way of example , the Instagram message released a day agoby Pere Huriwai-Seger on behalf of the Aotearoa Liberation League ( a front organisation comprised of Pere and his wife Sarah ) is important . <p> TDB Recommends NewzEngine.com <p> With film-star good looks and a compelling verbal style , Pere commands the viewers ' attention from the moment he authoritatively disabuses them of any notion that what is currently unfolding in Gaza is not their fight . New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An alarming " fact " if one 's knowledge of New Zealand 's role in the Middle East is poor -- i.e. most of the New Zealand population . That Pere flashes up a media release explaining that New Zealand has eight military personnel serving in the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation in no way excuses his claim that the country has troops involved . In the minds of his viewers , his words will have conjured up images of Kiwi soldiers rubbing shoulders with members of the Israeli Defence Force . It 's misinformation shading into disinformation . <p> Pere 's pace is brisk , and just seconds later he is informing his viewers that New Zealand has " long supported the colonisation of Palestine " . This is historical nonsense -- and malicious nonsense at that . He states as a fact that New Zealand " invaded " Palestine and " seized it for Britain " in 1917 . Curiously , he neglects to inform his viewers that the New Zealand Mounted Rifles was merely one unit in the British Expeditionary Force waging war against the Ottoman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ According to Pere , the province was handed over to " Zionist terrorists " . Curiouser and curiouser , since Ottoman Palestine was actually handed over to the British by the League of Nations as a " mandated territory " , and remained in British hands until 1948 . <p> But Pere is just getting warmed up . While they were busy making Palestine safe for Zionism , argues Pere , the Kiwis treated the Palestinian people " horribly " . He cites the Surafend massacre of 1918 as proof . <p> What happened at Surafend was n't pretty , but it did n't happen out of the blue . Troopers of the NZ Mounted Rifles and the Australian Light Horse went to the village of Surafend to secure the surrender of the Palestinian Arab who had shot dead Trooper Leslie Lowry after stealing his kit bag . Their demand refused , the Anzacs attacked the men of the village ( having evacuated the women and children to a place of safety ) killing as many as 200 , and setting their houses on fire . The Anzac perpetrators received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of them were ever punished . <p> Had Pere homed in on the Surafend massacre right from the start of his video , he could have presented a picture of New Zealand 's complicity in British , and later American , imperialism that was not only persuasive by truthful . Instead , by surrounding the Surafend massacre with a string of disinformative statements , the whole four-minute video becomes an exercise in the most blatant propaganda . And not just any propaganda , Pere 's falsehoods are the falsehoods of Hamas and their Iranian backers -- whose cause Pere equates with the cause of Maori nationalism in Aotearoa . Presumably , what Hamas terrorists did to the Jewish inhabitants of Southern Israel is what decolonisation looks like . <p> Imagine the reaction of the Disinformation Project if they had found a video presentation promoting right-wing disinformation and hate on such a scale . A video dripping with Islamophobic hate in the same way Pere 's drips with annihilationist hatred of Israel . Such a video would have been presented to the mainstream media as evidence of the danger posed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisive action against such horrific hate speech . <p> And they would have lapped it up . <p> Chris Trotter is New Zealand 's leading leftwing political commentator , with 30 years of experience writing professionally about New Zealand politics .

And he leased it to vinedressers and went into a far country . Now when vintage-time drew near , he sent his servants to the vinedressers , that they might receive its fruit . And the vinedressers took his servants , beat one , killed one , and stoned another . Again he sent other servants , more than the first , and they did likewise to them . Then last of all he sent his son to them , saying , ' They will respect my son . ' But when the vinedressers saw the son , they said among themselves , ' This is the heir . Come , let us kill him and seize his inheritance . ' So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and killed him . <p> " Therefore , when the owner of the vineyard comes , what will he do to those vinedressers ?

" <p> Jesus said to them , " Have you never read in the Scriptures : <p> ' The stone which the builders rejected Has become the chief cornerstone . This was the Lord 's doing , And it is marvelous in our eyes ' ? <p> " Therefore I say to you , the kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to a nation bearing the fruits of it . And whoever falls on this stone will be broken ; but on whomever it falls , it will grind him to powder .

If the Maori battalion had been in the first world war and ended up involved in the situation at Surafend how would they have reacted after having one of their own murdered , and being loyal soldiers of the British Crown ? .

Strange indeed .... <p> Are they fighting for Islam or just not making sweeping generalisations ? In other words the extremism that has hijacked the ' brand ' of Islam is not representative of the vast majority of Muslims .

@@102893234 <h> GUEST BLOG : Ben Morgan -- Pacific Intelligence Update <p> The ABC reports that Tongans are increasingly arming themselves , often illegally and that the day-to-day carriage of firearms is becoming more common in the community . A situation with serious security implications for the nation . The reports states that Tongans cite rising crime rates and increasing violence as the reasons for arming themselves . <p> Another factor is that Pacific nations like Tonga are used by international criminal gangs as a transit point for smuggling drugs into Australia and New Zealand . Tonga has a large coastline and limited surveillance and law enforcement capability making it an easy place to smuggle drugs or guns . It also has a close relationship with Australia and New Zealand , people frequently travelling relatively freely between these nations providing opportunities for drug smuggling . <p> Sometimes insiders play a role in the lucrative trade and last a month customs officer was arrested smuggling a selection of firearms and ammunition into the country . Tonga is a small nation with a population of about 106,000 and ABC reports that over the last five years 2,000 illegal guns have been confiscated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant and alarming . The proliferation of firearms in communities with relatively weak governance and institutions is very dangerous . In November 2006 , the capital Nuku'alofa was severely damaged in a politically inspired riot . Police and military support from Australia and New Zealand were required to restore order . <p> An event that could have been much more dangerous if the community was heavily armed . Additionally , rendition to Tonga of convicted criminals of Tongan descent from the United States and Australia provides local connections for criminal organisations exacerbating the possibility of drug and firearms smuggling . <p> More trouble in the South China Sea , Chinese Coastguard get physical <p> Chinese Coastguard and militia ( police ) vessels physically blocked Philippines ships trying to resupply its garrison on the Second Thomas Shoal . Chinese vessels making contact with and ' bumping ' Philippines vessels on 22 October . Dangerous and aggressive actions designed to intimidate . <p> TDB Recommends NewzEngine.com <p> Philippines has a small garrison on the shoal that is there to enforce the nation 's claim to the area . The garrison is housed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resupply of the Philippines soldiers on the shoal . The aim being to starve the Philippines garrison and force their removal from the shoal . <p> China 's strategy and tactics are straight out of the hybrid warfare ' play book , ' it uses a pseudo-legal justification to assert its ' right ' to occupy Second Thomas Shoal . Regardless , of the fact that international courts do not support the claim . China then enforces its claim using para-military internal security forces like the Coastguard and militia . Using these forces instead of the military plays to the narrative that Second Thomas Shoal is in fact Chinese territory . It also reduces the chances of military escalation from other nations . <p> China 's Coastguard has large and very capable vessels that are easily able to physically push , bump or even ram Philippines Coastguard vessels . How can Philippines respond ? If its navy or air force sinks a Chinese Coastguard vessel it risks escalation and provides China with moral basis for information operations ( propaganda ) that undermine the nation 's claim to the shoal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future of hybrid conflict in the Pacific . <p> The counters to hybrid war tactics are ; transparent rule of law and deterrence . The international rule of law provides a transparent basis for diplomacy and by supporting valid claims nations protect their own rights within that system . Ignoring pseudo-legal or unsubstantiated claims is good for all small nations . However , the price of the international rule of law is deterrence because nations that support it must also be committed to deterring nations from using aggression to enforce claims . This is why many nations support Ukraine , and the reason that the United States is building a network of allies and partners in the Pacific . By working together nations share the costs of deterrence and even small nations can expect their territorial rights to be protected . <p> Last month Timor Leste signed a strategic partnership deal with China . Prime Minister Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Xanana Gusmao meeting at the Asian Games and announcing a strategic partnership . The partnership includes infrastructure development , finance , agriculture , health and economic support . Agricultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply problems . In exchange , Timor Leste affirmed the ' One China ' policy the agreement stating that " Taiwan is an inalienable part of China 's territory and oppose any forms of ' Taiwan independence . ' ' <p> This statement is an example of ' legal warfare , ' within the spectrum of hybrid war . Every nation that affirms the ' One China ' policy and votes in international forums to support it , provides China with an increased mandate for aggression . Further , the support of small nations in international forums can be leveraged to present a legal claim in terms of a justifiable reaction to the historic colonial powers , a form of rebellion against the existing international ' establishment . ' A powerful narrative in many now independent nations that suffered colonisation . <p> China 's interest in Timor Leste is not new , in 2002 it was the first nation to recognise the new country . It is an indicator of the nation 's strategic location that Prime Minister Xi took time to meet with Prime Minister Gusmao . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this criticism continued in October . Australia is the nation 's largest donor and provides considerable defence support . President of Timor Leste , Jos ? Ramos-Horta responded to this criticism with a statement on 9 October alleging that Chinese diplomats took military aid ' off the table ' worried about an Australian ' over reaction . ' Timor Leste is another fault line in Pacific security , one located very close to Australia and worth keeping a close watch on . <p> On 18 October , Australia and Fiji announced a new $68 million partnership agreement . The announcement was made during Fijian Prime Minister , Sitiveni Rabuka 's visit to Australia . The deal provides economic aid and includes cyber security support , streamlining visa processes and the sale of 14 Bushmaster armoured vehicles . <p> Australian Prime Minister , Anthony Albanese praised Prime Minister Rabuka 's commitment to relationships with traditional friends like Australia and the United States . Under Prime Minister Rabuka , Fiji has moved away from Chinese influence and further into the United States sphere of influence . Fiji is positioned to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pacific nations and larger powers like Australia . <p> Papua New Guinean and China discuss common currency arrangements <p> Papua New Guinea Prime Minister , James Marape 's visit to China included an interesting discussion about a common trade currency between the nations . Currently , like many small nations Papua New Guinea trades internationally using the USD . <p> The discussion moved towards recognition of each other 's currency and the establishment of China Development Bank offices in Papua New Guinea to manage financial transactions . <p> This discussion has wider implications because the USD is the premium currency of international trade . Almost every nation recognises the USD and that recognition gives the currency an intrinsic value that supports the United States economy . China 's competition with the United States is not only military but economic . By providing options other than the USD for trade China seeks to devalue America 's currency and reduce the nation 's economic power . The Prime Minister Marape 's discussions could be the start of something much bigger as China uses the size of it domestic market to convince smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yuan , as their currency for international trade . <p> Papua New Guinea fuel shortage <p> A fuel shortage means that petrol may soon be rationed in Papua New Guinea . Most of Papua New Guinea 's petrol is supplied by Puma Energy . The company has been warning of fuel shortages for some time stating that a lack of foreign currency ( i.e.USD ) makes it impossible to buy fuel on international markets . <p> The links between this situation and Prime Minister Marape 's discussion with China about transactions using their currency are easy to see and demonstrate how economic situations are used to build influence in smaller nations . <h> STAY CONNECTED <p> Launched on Friday 1 March , 2013 , the ' TheDailyBlog.co.nz ' unites New Zealand 's leading left/centre-left commentators and progressive opinion shapers to provide the other side of the story on today 's news , media and political agendas.

@@102983237 <h> The Day Guterres Became Relevant <p> The relevance given to a UN Secretary-General is often judged by the degree of controversy caused . In history , the most relevant are usually targeted . Dag Hammarskj ? ld , refusing to remain a mere bauble of international office , was almost certainly murdered over his intervention in the Congo civil war in 1961 . The least relevant ( who was that sweet little fella , Ban Ki-Moon ? ) have barely registered a note of dissent . The big powers like to know they can render such figures impotent , if not insignificant . <p> It was , for that reason , refreshing to see the current occupant of that post make the less than startling remark that the atrocious attacks of October 7 staged by Hamas and Islamic Jihad on Israeli soil could not be seen as standalone acts of individual , unprovoked outrage . Ant ? nio Guterres was careful to also note that there was " nothing " that could " justify the deliberate killing , injuring and kidnapping of civilians , or the launching of rockets against civilian targets " . <p> Guterres also noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum . " The Palestinians had " been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation . They have seen their land steadily devoured by settlements and plagued by violence ; their economy stifled ; their people displaced and their homes demolished . " <h> Are you getting our free newsletter ? <p> While the attacks by Hamas could not be justified to address such grievances , they also could not be used as a pretext to " justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people . " Even war , he explained to his colleagues , had rules . <p> The Secretary-General also reiterated the principle of protecting civilians during armed conflict . This precluded using them as human shields and ordering " more than one million people to evacuate the south , where there is no shelter , no food , no water , no medicine , and no fuel , and then continuing to bomb the south itself . " <p> Such comments did not go down well with the Israeli Foreign Minister . Bullies of international relations are always easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gasp and wonder which world the secretary-general was living in . " Definitely , this is not our world . " <p> The foreign minister made it fairly clear what sort of world that was . " I will not meet the UN Secretary-General . After the October 7th massacre , there is no place for a balanced approach . Hamas must be erased off the face of the planet . " <p> Gilad Erdan , the Israeli ambassador to the United Nations , spoke in the voice of complacency outraged , going so far as to demand the resignation of Guterres . " A Secretary-General who does not understand that the murder of innocents can never be understood by any ' background ' can not be Secretary-General . " With a callow splutter , he suggested that the UN chief had " expressed an understanding for terrorism and murder . " <p> On army radio , Erdan also announced that Israel would be refusing " to issue visas to UN representatives . We have already refused a visa for the undersecretary general for humanitarian affairs , Martin Griffiths . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> As ever , Erdan 's reasoning confused explication with justification , but in that world , the nuanced explanation huffs and puffs in tired resignation , leaving the murderous justification to take the front position . <p> The comments from Guterres also come in light of the perilous operational state of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees ( UNRWA ) . The humanitarian agency has been starved of resources and will be forced to cease the provision of hospital care , largely occasioned by Israel 's blockade on fuel . " Current stocks are almost completely exhausted , " the agency states in its October 26 situation report , " forcing life-saving services to come to a halt . This includes the supply of piped water as well as fuel for the health sector , bakeries , and generators . " Staff have also suffered a horrendous : 39 have been killed since October 7 . <p> As for the attacks on his own integrity , Guterres has been combative . " I am shocked by the misrepresentations by some of my statement ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is false . It was the opposite . " <p> The brainstorming session in the Netanyahu-IDF meetings must have been straightforward : de-historicise conflict , first and foremost ; relegate Hamas to some equivalent monstrous organisation , in this case , ISIS ; and then , just to make sure , use Nazism and the Holocaust as recyclable motifs . <p> Along the way , massive Palestinian casualties , many children ( 2,360 deaths over three weeks ) , can be excused by pointing the finger at Hamas , because it is not Israeli jets and weapons doing the killing but the policy of a terrorist organisation . And besides , Israel is , as Cohen insists , doing it for " the civilised world " . <p> The Israeli strategy here is to excuse the inexcusable : the collective , mass laceration of a people . In this , they simply perpetuate the tragic crimes that have been visited , not only upon the Jews , but upon any ethnicity or group in history . The Whig statesman Edmund Burke spoke about not knowing " the method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Unfortunately , in this conflict , that indictment was drawn up some time ago , and is being prosecuted with relentless ruthlessness . <p> Dr. Binoy Kampmark was a Commonwealth Scholar at Selwyn College , Cambridge .

The full whakatauki is as follows : <p> If you remove the central shoot of the flax bush , where will the bellbird find rest ? If you were to ask me , ' What is the most important thing in the world ?

We would also expect all providers to engage in a process of constant quality improvement , including regular evaluation and monitoring of services . We would expect the latter to include regular , robust and safe processes for seeking feedback from end users and their families and whanau . <p> PVI regularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providers , well before a formal complaint is laid .

We at PVI have previously raised concerns regarding the various ways that senior leadership at IHC has treated our families and whanau who have raised concerns , both at an informal and a formal level . <p> We welcome the release of this report into complaint policies , processes , and practices at IDEA Services . From the perspective of our families , this investigation is long overdue . We are heartened by the clear instruction to IDEA Services and to Whaikaha to rebuild the lost trust engendered by previous poor performance . We are also heartened at the recognition of the need for IDEA Services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take steps to address this . In particular , we are supportive of the recommendations for IDEA Services ( and , by proxy , IHC ) to take a zero tolerance approach to retaliation on those raising concerns and that all concerns and complaints are to be welcomed . We look forward to IDEA Services implementing the recommendations , including the requirement to " set out clearly procedural steps it will take to demonstrate this approach to the community it serves , including such actions as considering removing a staff member who has been accused of retaliatory action while investigations are carried out . " Our family and whanau who have been on the receiving end of past retaliatory measures also welcome this recommendation . <p> Sadly , we remain disappointed with the senior leadership at IHC , who we are informed have actively sought to delay the release of the investigation .

It has been incredibly hard to hear the grim realities faced by whanau , and the dismissive and retaliatory way in which so many of our families have been treated . Reading this report , I am hopeful that we will see a much-needed improvement in systems and staff approaches across the entire organisation . It has hurt my heart a great deal to hear that the leadership of a major service provider has been unable to perceive ( and therefore improve ) the systemic hurt and harm caused .

The results show a very efficient slide . <p> Source : Qualcomm <p> After several years of teasing , Qualcomm has finally unveiled its first chip designed for PC thanks to its all-new Oryon architecture : the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite . Several brands should offer laptops with this chip in 2024 . At the moment , journalists were able to try it on two reference devices created by Qualcomm . <p> The brand has chosen its schedule well by lifting the ban on these first tests a few hours before the Apple conference . The latter should reveal its lineup of Apple M3 chipsets that could reclaim the crown that Qualcomm is stealing . <h> A very powerful chip in benchmarks <p> Journalists attending the Snapdragon Summit were able to run a series of benchmarks on PCs prepared by Qualcomm . <p> Two configurations were shown : the first " Config B " laptop with a 14-inch OLED display with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a more efficient " Config A " PC with an 80W chip and a 16.5-inch display .

The results are consistent with those presented by Qualcomm . This makes some sense because the brand controls the testing environment here . We will have to wait until the first computers are commercialized so that each journalist can conduct his own tests . But it is already interesting for the press to be able to see the performance of machines in the specified parameters . <p> In terms of single-core , Qualcomm 's new chip is slightly ahead of its direct competitors like the Apple M2 .

As a reminder , the Apple M2 integrates 8 CPU cores , including only 4 high-performance cores . <p> The Wilflife Extreme test highlights the graphics part of the SoC . Here , Apple and Qualcomm are playing an even game ahead of what AMD and Intel offer on their SoCs . However , it would be interesting to be able to compare it with devices equipped with dedicated graphics chips , in particular Nvidia 's GeForce . <h> Limitations of this calling plan <p> Although an impressive showing on paper , a few things need to be put into context . First of all , the first computers with Snapdragon I heard about were Apple 's M4 chipset . Likewise , AMD and Intel should have enough time to prepare a new generation of chips for the Snapdragon X Elite . <p> Moreover , the main obstacle to adopting a Snapdragon X Elite-powered device today remains Windows ' lack of adaptation to ARM platforms .

@@103086236 <h> The Forty Beheaded Babies Who Survived The Hamas Attack <p> No babies aged 0-3 years have yet been named amongst the dead of Hamas 's October 7th attack . The stories of beheaded babies , it now seems likely , were in fact weapons of mass destruction launched by experienced Israeli and American media warriors to enflame emotions and soften the ground for genocide . It 's not the first time this has happened . It is time we learnt the lessons of history . <p> Within hours of the October 7 attack Israeli Defence Force spokesmen reported that babies had been beheaded by Hamas fighters . The story was obligingly flashed across CNN , the Guardian , BBC , countless front pages , and shot out via a billion complicit or gullible Facebook and X posts . Within another few hours the story had mutated into " 40 babies beheaded " and flew out of the mouths of influencers on countless news channels . <p> " Stranger Things " star Noah Schnapp was one who fuelled the fire , sending his 25 million Instagram followers this post : " 40 babies were beheaded and burned alive in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Biden said he had seen images of them , and said " I have been doing this for a long time , I never thought I would see -- have confirmed pictures of -- terrorists beheading children . " The White House quickly retracted his claim . The Hill warned that Biden is a " serial fabulist " -- but the old boy had done his job : genocide is now easier for Israel to commit . 3000 Palestinian children now lie dead , along with a number of Israeli children , including at least one four-year-old killed in the Hamas attack . All civilian lives , especially children 's , should be inviolate . No exceptions . <h> Are you getting our free newsletter ? <p> Parts of the media are now rowing back their claims . CNN anchor Sara Sidner said : " Yesterday the Israeli Prime Minister 's office said that it had confirmed Hamas beheaded babies &amp; children while we were live on the air . The Israeli government now says today it CAN NOT confirm babies were beheaded . I needed to be more careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unlike the real victims of October 7 and unlike the hundreds of Palestinian babies who have been slaughtered by the Israelis , whose shattered bodies we 've actually seen , these 40 fictive infants survived the attack and will be boxed up , ready for repackaging next time a monstrous lie is needed to justify war crimes . <p> Haaretz , Israel 's leading newspaper , which has been filled with war cries since the attack , has published details of over 930 named dead from the October 7 attack . As of the time of writing , not one baby aged 0 to three years old has been publicly identified . Not one . Let alone a beheaded one . Let alone 40 . <p> Does that matter ? Was n't what Hamas did sufficiently bad , evil , enough of a war crime to justify the revenge we are witnessing ? Apparently not . But do n't ask me ; ask Biden , Netanyahu , Ursula Von Der Leyen , Rishi Sunak and the thousands of western journalists who spat it into the faces of people trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised my voice in defence of innocent Palestinian civilians , I was shouted down by friends , incandescent with rage over dead babies . Now when I raise my voice after hundreds of babies have been slaughtered in Gaza , I 'm greeted with indifference by many of those same people . But the tide is turning ... the arc of history must surely turn towards justice . Justice is the seed ; peace is the flower . <p> Here is why this particular lie was so important to tell : When your business is genocide you want your victims to appear as evil as possible . <p> I 'm Irish : we know what it is to be vilified , treated and described as animals , forbidden fundamental human rights , bombed and burnt into submission , to be driven off our land and to be starved into death or exodus . Dehumanising us was part of the project . <p> Back to dead babies as tools of propaganda . <p> The Bible tells of the Jewish King Herod slaughtering new-borns as he tried to eliminate the little Babe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Israelis would like to ethnically cleanse the Palestinians of Gaza ) . The rest is history . Or not . <p> The bible story mutated over centuries into the famous Blood Libel that blamed the Jews not only for the death of Jesus but said Jews sacrificed , even ate , Christian babies in secret rituals . It was a Convenient Untruth used to justify mass murder and persecution of Jewish populations throughout Europe from the Middle Ages to the 20th Century . <p> But times change and the dead babies are assigned new duties . <p> Who remembers the dozens of babies thrown out of incubators by Iraqis soldiers at the hospital in Kuwait City in 1990 ? Millions of people across the world , me included , sat riveted by the testimony of a tearful young Kuwaiti woman called Nayirah who gave evidence at a crucial Congressional hearing that helped build support in the American mind for a holy war against Satan Saddam Hussein . Nayirah was working as a volunteer in a hospital when Iraqi soldiers burst in , removing the babies from incubators and tossing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following her testimony , which created a global media storm at the time , Chairman Rep John Porter , said : " We have never heard in all this time , in all circumstances , a record of inhumanity , brutality , and sadism as the ones the witnesses have given us today . " <p> Powerful . Moving . But a pack of utter lies . <p> The knowing and cynical Rep. Porter had asked that only Nayirah 's first name be used to protect her family . Good reason for that : Nayirah was the daughter of the Kuwaiti Ambassador to Washington . She was a member of al-Sabah family , the ruling house of Kuwait , had never worked in a hospital , and , as she admitted much later , had never witnessed any babies being thrown out of incubators . Not one . What she had done was sit for days with Hill &amp; Knowlton , the American public relations company used by the Pentagon to build war lust amongst the US population . Not a difficult thing to do . They scripted the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work on gullible minds . <p> Rep. Porter told listeners that people in the " civilised " world must do everything in their power to remove this " scourge " . Shortly after Nayirah 's testimony A-10 Warthogs , Abraham tanks , cruise missiles and all the same sort of instruments of death now being used on Gazan civilians were unleashed on the Iraqis . Hundreds of thousands were killed or maimed . When challenged over the deaths of thousands of real Iraqi babies in a subsequent US blockade , Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said : " This is a very hard choice but we think the price is worth it . " <p> The Incubator babies had helped lay the groundwork for such monstrous inhumanity . The beheaded babies of Israel have done their job too - allowing Netanyahu to say the assault on Gaza is a " holy mission " . Fellow Knesset MPs have called for a non-nuclear Hiroshima , a second Nakba , another bombing like that of Dresden - praising the resolution of the British and Americans in committing these acts .

@@103275232 <h> Police Withdrawal Of Prosecution Concerning Fatal Motorcycle Accident <p> The Independent Police Conduct Authority has found that Police were unjustified in their decision to withdraw a charge against a man pertaining to a fatal motorcycle accident at Rotorua on 29 January 2019 . <p> At about 5.25pm , 57-year-old Tony Parahi was riding his motorcycle south along State Highway 36 , adjacent to Lake Rotorua . Ahead of Mr Parahi was a man , a local farm worker , who was driving a 12-metre-long tractor and trailer in the same direction . The farm worker pulled over to his left to let two cars pass before he turned right , across the road to enter a paddock . This manoeuvre took him into the path of Mr Parahi on his motorcycle . <p> Police reconstructions indicated that in trying to avoid a collision with the tractor and trailer , Mr Parahi braked heavily and lost control of his motorcycle . He was thrown onto the roadway , the motorcycle vaulted in the air and landed on him . Members of the public assisted Mr Parahi , but he died at the scene . <p> Police investigated the crash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . On 19 May 2020 , after the matter had been before the Court for 10 months , and was listed for trial , the Police prosecutor withdrew the charge , informing the Court that no evidence would be offered . <p> A Coronial Inquest into Mr Parahi 's death was held in May 2021 . The Coroner found the death was an avoidable accident , in that the farm worker was careless in not waiting for the motorcycle to pass . <p> In December 2021 , we received a complaint from a member of Mr Parahi 's whanau and conducted an independent investigation . We found there were shortfalls in the crash investigation , but it was of sufficient quality to lay the charge . We found that the Police 's decision to withdraw the charge was inexplicable , and the matter should have been decided in court by a Judge .

The pulses are then reflected by the surface back to the sensor and individual elevation measurements are recorded , based on the time each pulse takes to return to the sensor . <p> The pulse allows for discrimination between different surface types and ground features , such as trees and buildings , against the bare earth ground surface . <h> Did you know Scoop has an Ethical Paywall ? <p> If you 're using Scoop for work , your organisation needs to pay a small license fee with Scoop Pro .

@@103627237 <p> Health and Disability Commissioner Morag McDowell today released a report from a Commissioner Initiated Investigation into care delivered by a GP ( Dr A ) and a clinic during the COVID-19 pandemic . <p> Dr A consulted with patients in-person while unvaccinated between 15 November and 15 December 2021 . During this time , Dr A was legally required to be vaccinated under the COVID-19 Public Health Response ( Vaccinations ) Order 2021 . <p> Dr A and the clinic claimed they believed Dr A could continue seeing patients in-person while waiting for a response to their application for Temporary Significant Service Disruption Exemption ( TSSDE ) from Manatu Hauora/Ministry of Health . This application requested vaccination exemption for Dr A , who did not choose to be vaccinated because of a religious and spiritual objection . <p> The application for TSSDE was declined on December 2 . On December 9 the clinic and Dr A also received a reminder from Manatu Hauora/Ministry of Health stating their application had been denied and noting that it was critical for staff to be vaccinated . However , Dr A continued to see patients in-person until December 15 . The clinic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then , after 9 December , were unable to re-schedule all the patients . <p> In addition , Dr A issued 282 medical certificates to patients indicating that , on the basis of their medical conditions , it would be inappropriate or unsuitable for those patients to be vaccinated with the COVID-19 vaccine . In many of those cases there were no medical conditions ( as claimed on the certificates ) . Also there was no documented evidence that Dr A provided any evidence-based information about the vaccine to assist patients make informed decisions about it . <p> Advertisement - scroll to continue reading <h> Are you getting our free newsletter ? <p> Ms McDowell found Dr A breached Right 4(2) of the Code , which gives consumers the right to services that comply with legal , professional , ethical and other relevant standards .

World interest rates have also increased , placing downward pressure on the New Zealand dollar exchange rate and , all else equal , boosting inflationary pressure within the economy . " ( RBNZ Nov MPS ) <p> The RBNZ left the cash rate unchanged at 5.50% - no surprises . But the OCR track was lifted from 5.59% to 5.69% - big surprise . The RBNZ came out a lot more hawkish than expected . Inflation came in below their August expectations . But the RBNZ made clear that the champagne 's still sitting on ice . Rapidly decelerating imported inflation is doing most of the work in bringing down headline inflation . Domestic inflation is a slow-moving beast . And risks are tilted to the upside . Upside risks for which the RBNZ holds very little tolerance . Inflation has been sitting above target since mid-2021 , and is forecast to remain above 3% for another 12 months . It 's going take some time before we get back to the 2% target . And the RBNZ is running out of patience . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hike rates again if needed . Inflation expectations have become unanchored , and their credibility is under threat . <h> Are you getting our free newsletter ? <p> " Some members noted that inflation has now been above target for some time , and that there should be a low tolerance for any increase in the time to return inflation to target . " ( RBNZ Nov MPS ) <p> Everything washes out in the OCR track . And it was more hawkish than we had hoped . The key message in the track is that the RBNZ is willing to raise the cash rate again . The RBNZ lifted the OCR track to 5.69% by the September 2024 quarter . So odds are on ( 75% ) for another rate hike and way out in 2024 . We were surprised by the move . The RBNZ is clearly putting more emphasis on the growing demand impulse of the current migration boom . There 's greater risk that the boost to aggregate demand and housing ( specifically rents ) will outweigh the deflationary force of greater supply capacity . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to also remind markets that " higher for longer " remains the rhetoric . Influenced largely by offshore developments , wholesale rates have recently drifted lower -- effectively loosening financial conditions . And that 's not something the RBNZ wants here and now . What they do want is for rates to remain restrictive to continue weighing on household consumption and broader economic activity . Wholesale rates and therefore mortgage and other lending rates , need to stay high and dry . And the threat of further rate hikes does just that . <p> The other , somewhat academic , rational for the move higher in the OCR track was the upward revision to the guesstimated " neutral rate " -- the Goldilocks interest rate that 's not hot or cold , it 's just right . The non-contractionary rate was lifted in the August MPS , from 2% to 2.25% , resulting in a higher track . And we saw the same play out today . The neutral rate was revised up 25bps to 2.50% . That 's the RBNZ 's way of saying the current level of interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The current cash rate is a little less effective in constraining demand . So basically , monetary policy is not quite as tight . And , in their eyes , we can handle a little higher rates . <p> But the hawkishness did n't stop with the lift in the OCR track peak . Thoughts of rate cuts were also squashed . The new track has now pushed out the first rate cut to 2025 , which would mean RBNZ staying on hold for 2 years ! We disagree . We acknowledge that the risk over the next 6-9 months is tilted toward further tightening . The RBNZ admitted an upward bias to rates . But we still believe the RBNZ will be in a position to normalise policy next year . Rate cuts could well be a 2024 story . Just later in 2024 . We expect the inflation rate to be back within the 1-3% target band by mid-2024 , and confidently returning to the 2% target . In saying that , our initial call for May is proving optimistic , at this stage . The RBNZ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prints , before changing direction .

@@103939240 <p> Based on in-depth interviews with workers from two companies , the study finds that fun activities should n't be uniformly enforced or encouraged by workplaces ; instead , a nuanced understanding of individual preferences and safety considerations is required . <p> The researchers say hybrid work , where employees work partly in the office and partly at home , may foster greater interpersonal ambiguity with physical cues missing from some interactions . <p> " This creates challenges for generating emotional safety and for encouraging fun at work , as interpreting the experience of fun , and understanding what 's safe may be increasingly hard to navigate .

@@104341235 <h> Inside the 5-year search for justice after innocent man killed in gang revenge <p> David Kuka was a familiar face in downtown Tauranga , athough shoppers would hear his voice before they saw him . <p> Tall and rangy , with long dark hair , the 52-year-old would walk the city streets with his fist raised to the sky , pointing to heaven . <p> Wearing a leather vest with a cross on the back , Kuka would spend his weekend nights busking with his guitar and singing loudly about his saviour . <p> He was a loud and proud Christian , a gentle soul who cared deeply about others despite falling on hard times . <p> Kuka was sleeping in his car when he met Stewart Keepa , who was washing dishes at a dinner to feed the homeless in the city . <p> Keepa ran a second-hand store out of an industrial building in the suburb of Gate Pa , where he lived in a room upstairs . <p> There was a spare room , too . It was n't much but Kuka was grateful for a roof over his head . <p> In return , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 'd keep the place tidy , and make a little money on the side selling his traditional Maori carvings . <p> When Keepa came home late on a Sunday evening to find the front door slightly ajar , he instinctively felt something was amiss . <p> It was February 11 , 2018 and Keepa had just ducked out to take his cousin to the supermarket . <p> Worried that he did n't have enough gas to make the trip , Keepa had borrowed Kuka 's car , a red Honda , and after dropping his cousin home , arrived back at Wilrose Place shortly after 10pm . <p> " I heard this horrible breathing , gasping for air , coming from upstairs in the kitchen where I last saw David , " Keepa said . <p> " I called out his name , but all I could hear was gasping . I ran upstairs and there was David on the floor . I tried to wake him , to see what was wrong , but there was no response ... no movement , no talking , nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirtless , in a pool of blood . He had been shot , twice . <p> A homicide inquiry was soon underway with Detective Sergeant Paul Barron put in charge of solving the puzzle . Investigators often talk about the magic window , the 48 hours after a crime has been committed . <p> The 50 police staff working on the case moved quickly to gather evidence that might soon be lost : Interviewing key witnesses who frequented Keepa 's store , The Trap , securing text message and call data before it was deleted , as well as security camera footage before files were overwritten . <p> There was no smoking gun , nothing that immediately identified the killer . There was , however , a lead that was too obvious to ignore . <p> Someone else had been killed at The Trap just six weeks earlier . <p> The first victim , Lance Waite , a longstanding member of the Mongrel Mob , was also shot dead . <p> Lance Waite was fatally shot in January 2018 . Photo / Supplied <p> The shooter was Colin Jeffries-Smith , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in debt to the tune of $3400 , then made the problem worse by taking $2000 in cash from a buyer - but failed to stump up the promised meth . <p> Debt collection in the drug world involves standover tactics , or " taxing " , where criminals extort cash , drugs or valuables from other criminals in fear of violence or intimidation . <p> " Taxing " is rarely reported to police , as the victims are in fear of further retribution or exposing their own criminal behaviour . <p> Waite offered to collect the debt , and " taxed " Jeffries-Smith 's car on December 31 , 2017 . <p> Although worth only $800 , the silver Nissan Maxima was his most valuable possession . <p> It was also the only way to keep Jeffries-Smith 's drug business afloat , and any hope of repaying his debt disappeared with it . <p> The next day , the woman owed $2000 , drove the Nissan Maxima to the Cameron Rd home of Jeffries-Smith to demand more money . <p> He managed to snatch the keys from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car to be towed to ' the Trap ' at Wilrose Place in Gate Pa . <p> By this point , Jeffries-Smith was getting desperate . He spent most of January 2 negotiating to get his car back , to no avail . He was ready to " start chopping c**** up " , according to a text message he sent . A tomahawk and a knife were later found in a backpack he was carrying . <p> The small-time drug dealer also visited a man called Casino Williams , who encouraged Jeffries-Smith to " take a stand and shoot the c*** " . <p> Waite was Mongrel Mob , Williams was Black Power . The pair were longtime rivals , both in their 50s , and had bad blood . <p> Williams handed Jeffries-Smith a semi-automatic Ruger rifle , before he returned to The Trap on the morning of January 3 , 2018 in one final bid to bargain for his car . <p> Lance Waite refused . Jeffries-Smith left and later returned with the loaded weapon . He stood in the doorway of a bedroom , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman he was staying with <p> When the mobster finally appeared in the hallway , Jeffries-Smith pointed the Ruger at him and demanded his car keys . <p> Again , Waite refused and turned to leave . So Jeffries-Smith shot him . Waite ran down the stairwell to escape , so Jeffries-Smith shot him again , in the back . <p> The Mongrel Mob member was taken to Tauranga Hospital but soon died of his injuries . <p> Within a few days , Colin Jeffries-Smith was arrested and charged with murder . <p> He would later be found guilty of the lesser charge of manslaughter at trial , as the jury accepted he acted in self-defence out of fear of Waite . <p> Colin Richard Jeffries-Smith , left , and Casino Heta Williams appear in the High Court at Rotorua in relation to the murder of Lance Waite at Gate Pa , Tauranga .

But what was the connection ? <p> There was absolutely no suggestion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kuka had once been a member of rival Black Power , that was years ago , and in any event , the police had already arrested Waite 's killer . <p> There was also no evidence that Kuka was involved in drug dealing at The Trap ; just smoking a little bit of weed with Stewart Keepa every now and then . <p> Although solving the death of Lance Waite was relatively simple , the death of David Kuka was proving anything but . <p> Operation Ubertas was slowly able to develop a picture of what happened in the days and weeks after Waite 's death , though it was murky and constantly changing . <p> Drug dealers , addicts and gang members are unreliable and reluctant witnesses at the best of times , and at worst deliberately misleading or downright hostile . <p> Paul Barron and his team spent a lot of time rattling cages in the criminal underworld , exerting pressure on people who do n't normally co-operate with the police . <p> Whatever they did manage to glean had to be corroborated by independent evidence , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What did become clear was the Mongrel Mob was very angry about the slaying of Lance Waite , who was a senior member of the Notorious chapter . <p> The day after his death , three carloads of patched Mobsters turned up at Wilrose Place . <p> They wanted Waite 's patch , a treasured possession in the gang world , but Stewart Keepa did n't have it . The leather vest was at the Tauranga police station . <p> Keepa was told to get in the car . He was reluctant but complied , as he felt a refusal would lead to trouble . <p> Of course , the police declined to hand over Waite 's patch as it was evidence in a homicide investigation . <p> Keepa was taken back to his shop unharmed but it was not the last time that the Mongrel Mob wanted to speak with him . <p> Soon after , he was later invited to the nearby home of the president of the gang 's Tauranga chapter . He quizzed Keepa about what he knew about Waite 's shooting and while that meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keepa was woken by the sound of a V8 engine in the driveway outside The Trap , followed by footsteps and the voices of two men calling out to him . <p> They identified themselves as members of the Hastings Mongrel Mob and ordered Keepa to " open the f***ing door " . <p> Three patched members barged in the front door and Keepa backed away up the stairs towards the kitchen . <p> One of the men stopped halfway up the stairs , while the other two followed Keepa into the kitchen and told him to sit down at the table . <p> One of the men was in his 40s , the other in his late 20s . <p> The younger man was around 190cm tall , with black shoulder-length hair and bulldog tattoos on his face . <p> " He was the one intimidating me , " Keepa would later tell a jury , " shooting questions and asking me who was here at the time of Lance 's shooting . " <p> Keepa told the mobsters he was present , as well as a woman who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member told Keepa to write the names down on a piece of paper , so he did . <p> " He kept on carrying on , asking ' who else was there ?

This gave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds of hours tracking CCTV footage of Luke Belmont 's distinctive Ford Falcon with a red bonnet , pictured here in Tauranga on the day of the murder . Photo / Police <p> On the day of the murder , the distinctive vehicle was captured on CCTV footage at a petrol station just outside Taupo at 11.54am . <p> It was then filmed travelling through Rotorua at 12.55pm , around the time when phone records showed Belmont called another member of Mongrel Mob Notorious who lived nearby . <p> His name was Dane Pukepuke , and their conversation lasted three minutes . <p> Belmont 's cell phone stopped polling in Rotorua that day , but his red-bonneted car was filmed driving through Te Puke at 4.20pm . <p> At 6.40pm , Belmont 's car was captured on CCTV footage turning off Cameron Rd , the main arterial route in Tauranga , and driving past the address of The Trap in Gate Pa . <p> The vehicle then travelled to Pyes Pa ( where the Mongrel Mob Aotearoa pad on Merrick Rd was located ) and Pukepuke 's cell phone also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ford Falcon was seen travelling through Greerton at 8.22pm , then arriving at the Gate Pa shopping centre near the Marble Bar 10 minutes later . <p> Also seen in the car park , recorded on CCTV , was a silver Ford Falcon . <p> It was the same car that the police already had footage of driving to and from The Trap shortly before Stewart Keepa found David Kuka lying in a pool of blood . <p> It was the same car that the Mongrel Mob prospect said he was instructed to strip down and scrap . <p> It was the murder car . <p> Several days earlier , the silver Ford Falcon came into the possession of a man called Kingi Tokona after someone had crashed it . <p> The police discovered there had been a discussion between Tokona and Maru Wright , a member of Mongrel Mob Aotearoa , about his captain Adrian Rewiri taking the car off his hands . <p> At 6.13pm ( when Pukepuke and Belmont 's car was at the gang pad at Merrick Rd ) Tokona sent a text message to Rewiri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rewiri called him at 8.08pm , shortly before Pukepuke travelled to the Marble Bar car park in Belmont 's car . <p> CCTV footage showed both Ford Falcon vehicles leave the Marble Bar at 8.38pm , then travel in convoy back down Cameron Rd back towards Pyes Pa . <p> At 9.13pm both vehicles left Pyes Pa and headed towards Welcome Bay , arriving at 9.18pm . <p> It 's at this point , the police believed , that Maru Wright handed over the silver Ford Falcon to Dane Pukepuke . <p> The silver car then travelled from Welcome Bay to Courtney Rd ( close to the Trap ) , where it was seen on CCTV cameras at 9.58pm , then drove away at 10.02pm . <p> Four minutes was all it took for David Kuka to be shot in his home . <p> The silver Ford Falcon was back in Welcome Bay by 10.36pm , then towards Oropi Rd , before it was left at the Merrick Rd pad for dismantling . <p> Less than an hour later , Belmont 's red-bonnet Ford Falcon was seen travelling through Welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the police pulled over Belmont 's car in Rotorua in a routine traffic stop .
