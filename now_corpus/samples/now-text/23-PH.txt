If there is one early message I would hope to impart , it is this : Lawyers do not necessarily make good lawmakers . <p> ADVERTISEMENT <p> Perhaps on its face this may seem like a rather perplexing idea considering the two professions ' shared subject . After all , we see the word " law " in both these functions . How different could they be ? <p> At the risk of stating the obvious , making the law is different from using it . I recall experiencing the contrast between law and public policy for myself during my research stay at Harvard . As a visiting scholar , my regular schedule brought me from the north-end of the Cambridge campus to the law school where I had joined a course on corporate accountability , to the school of governance ( otherwise known as Harvard Kennedy School , or " HKS " ) south-side by the Charles where I had joined a class on business and human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school , and was intrigued by the contrast of their answers . While one focused on administrative processes and codified standards , the other highlighted the role of political will and " norm diffusion . " One highlighted positive structures , while the other zeroed in on negative spaces . <p> Take by way of allegory " Rubin 's vase " -- perhaps one of the most popular examples of " optical art . " An interface of optical illusion and artwork , " Rubin 's vase " presents an image of a white-toned vase on black canvas . Now , depending on how you view it , you will see either one of two images : the vase front and center in white , or the dark spaces surrounding the vase , which in turn form the silhouette of two faces . <p> What is it that you see ? As lawyers , our job has been to focus on the positive space . On the structures that are already there . We study them for years , meticulously familiarizing ourselves with the statutes , regulations , and jurisprudence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is society . We look at Rubin 's work and see the bright lined vase , for what else is there outside of it but darkness ? But chaos ? <p> Lawmakers , however , have a different role . To them , the focus is less about the structures that are already set in place but the blank spaces in need of filling . While lawyers see Rubin 's vase , the lawmaker sees Rubin 's faces . The legal profession navigates existing frameworks , while legislative function delves into uncharted territory . Indeed , the legislative process is where the softness of policies and principles crystalize into law . <p> While the fields of law and policy may be distinct ( as indeed , they have respective schools on campus and respective schools of thought ) , they are not separate . Gone are the days that the legal field could be conceived on a pedestal . As a structure above and beyond societal levels . Indeed , the past two presidencies of the Philippines alone , from the former head Rodrigo Duterte to the incumbent Ferdinand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how defined in text and refined in promise , can not be detached from political winds . In a praetorian state like the Philippines , the trappings of democracy subvert democratic institutions . The goal , therefore , is not to separate politics from law or shield it from its winds . Rather , it is to harness their respective strengths . <p> We need to rethink the roles of the lawyer and the lawmaker alike . Indeed , either is less about the law and more about legal order . And therein lies a difference . Politics must not stand in the way of legal order , but neither does this mean that legal order should be confined to the pages of the codicil . Because whether our eyes glance at Rubin 's vase or Rubin 's faces , it is the contrast of light and dark , the entwinement of law and politics , that creates a holistic image . <p> Subscribe to INQUIRER PLUS to get access to The Philippine Daily Inquirer &amp; other 70+ titles , share up to 5 gadgets , listen to the news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social media .

@@96200238 <h> Preventing future no-flys <p> The New Year 's Day no-fly situation was an international embarrassment for us . How do we make sure it does n't happen again ? <p> It seems a faulty circuit breaker and a malfunctioning UPS system are just the outcome of something really wrong with the way the government manages its agencies . <p> Apparently , the warranty for the air traffic control system expired just before the new administration took over . That means it is no longer entitled to the usual periodic maintenance checks . <p> I understand the original manufacturer was willing to do the maintenance , but for a fee . <p> The other condition the manufacturer of the air traffic control system is asking for is complete payment for the system before they sign a maintenance contract . Apparently , years after the original contract was signed , CAAP has not completed payment . <p> That 's not good . Duterte and Tugade inaugurated a very critical system that had not been paid for , but which we have been using . I doubt we did n't have the money to pay . Duterte found money to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CAAP earns from its various charges to airlines -- from earnings in running airports and should be earning from airline over flights that can now be documented with the air traffic control system in place . CAAP runs most of the airports other than NAIA , Mactan , Clark , and Caticlan . <p> In 2020 , CAAP remitted P6 billion to the national Treasury , P3 billion in regular dividend and P3 billion as contribution to the Bayanihan fund . Yet , because of the pandemic , CAAP had a net loss of P2.6 billion that year . <p> For 2021 and 2022 , CAAP received a total subsidy of P2.4 billion . <p> It is also difficult to totally blame CAAP officials for the New Year 's Day fiasco . In their report to the House committee investigating the mishap , CAAP pointed out that as early as 2021 , they proposed to develop a switchable contingency for the air traffic control system . <p> They were thinking of a system that could be operated as a main/standby facility equipped with the complementing features and capabilities . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Project installed in another location will address the need of having a full back-up as a contingency system ... <p> " As soon as the new management assumed position , the matter of constructing a new CNS/ATM facility was presented and proposed as early as Aug. 31 , 2022 ... " <p> The estimated cost of the project is P13 billion . Not much more than the Pharmally contract . <p> As early as 2019 , CAAP had proposed a project to ensure system redundancy for data storage . The P139 million project will update four to five subsystems of the CNS/ATM to ensure all data is backed-up and will not be lost through data corruption . It will also ensure sufficient storage for aeronautical messages and international compatibility of flight plans without need of human intervention . <p> Again , as is expected in government operations , the time from proposal by the technical staff to procurement , award , and completion take years . Modernizing our air traffic control system was first proposed in the 1990s . It got NEDA approval in November 2000 . <p> JICA dispatched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new CNS/ATM System and prepare the tender of documents for project execution on June 30 , 2002 . <p> The procurement of consulting services started on Sept. 20 , 2005 , but the contract was awarded only on Feb. 13 , 2008 . <p> Contract package 1 was awarded to the Sumitomo-Thales Australia joint venture , with the contract signed on Nov. 17 , 2010 . Contract package 2 was awarded and contract signed on April 27 , 2011 . <p> Construction started on Dec. 17 , 2010 , but was suspended in May 2011 by COA , which questioned the participation of Thales , which was also the former Thomson-CSF that abandoned the Global Maritime Distress Safety System Project of DOTC in 2000 . The advance payment of package 1 was disallowed . <p> The project was derailed . COA lifted its disallowance after appeals on May 23 , 2013 . Exchange of Notes between our Department of Foreign Affairs and the Embassy of Japan was done and the project was resumed in August 2013 . <p> The project was completed and turned over in October 2017 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Philippine Air Traffic Management Center was inaugurated by Duterte in January 2018 . In November 2018 , Manila Approach , Clark Approach , and Manila Area Control Center transferred their operations to the new Philippine Air Traffic Management Center located at the CAAP compound in Pasay City . <p> The new system increased the capacity of air traffic volume in the Philippine airspace . Ten radars were added , bringing the total to 13 radars all over the country . <p> But why did it take so long to get this modernization project going ? And after it was installed , why have requests for upgrades made by the technical staff been apparently ignored by higher-ups during the Duterte watch ? <p> The institutional problem behind the New Year 's Day fiasco is obvious . Government , because of its bureaucratic rules and political intrusion , ca n't manage something as technical and critical as air traffic control . <p> There are many who are against privatizing this function , supposedly because of national security concerns . But we all saw how national security was put at risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that New Year 's Day fiasco . <p> There are other reasons to go private . Air travel demand is outpacing the ability of the government system to expand capacity . We are also losing trained air traffic controllers , and the ones we have are overworked and underpaid . We could be facing a disaster in the making due to physical fatigue and low morale . <p> It is a question of pay and benefits . Government pay is dismal to begin with and our air traffic controllers have a skill that has a good international price tag . Our controllers are pirated by foreign entities and they owe it to their families to take a job that earns many times more than what CAAP can pay them . <p> Hopefully , our legislators will understand the real cause of that no-fly day and think of real solutions so we do n't internationally embarrass ourselves again with such ineptitude that inconvenienced 78,000 passengers in 637 flights .

Since its rapid emergence , China has become the country 's largest trading partner . The volume of foreign merchanise trade between the two countries in 2020 amounted to $47.4 billion . Exports to China amounted to $12.9 billion and imports from China $34.5 billion . There is an $11.6 billion deficit , meaning we buy more than we sell to China . <p> Compare this trade with that of our other two top trading partners . In 2020 , the volume of two-way trade with Japan was $28.5 billion , and with the United States , $27.5 billion . With both countries , the Philippines had a trade surplus in that year : with Japan , $2.5 billion ; and with the United States , $3.4 billion . <p> It is imperative that the President pay important attention to economic relations even if only from the trade front ! But there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations in terms of direct business investments is also strong . Philippine capital investments in China is also substantial . Major business groups in the Philippines are invested in China 's growth -- in industry , in retailing , and in trading .

Such investments , in fact , are part of the reason why two-way trading relations between the two countries are further strengthening . <p> Bilateral trade with China could be boosted by direct efforts to engage with the Chinese leadership . It should be noted that this visit is the fourth major trip abroad of the new Philippines president since taking office . <p> Of course , even though such trade would naturally expand if the Philippines would ratify the RCEP -- an expansion of multilateral trade of ASEAN with the inclusion of major industrial and emerging powers that include Japan , South Korea , Australia into the new trade bloc . It is good to remind us that China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trading countries to form the bloc to further boost ASEAN 's trading relationships . <p> The South China Sea problem . The South China Sea fortifications that China undertook in recent years has heightened the crisis in international navigation in the critical sea lane area . They have brought the possibility of direct tensions between China and our country , and are at the forefront of geopolitical issues between the great powers . <p> These tensions between the Philippines and China are not unique to the two countries . All the countries bordering the South China Sea also have conflicting territorial claims with China . Once China decided to flex her military and geopolitical muscles by aggressively undertaking military fortifications , those tensions increased the risk of conflicts . To other countries without direct territorial claims , the issue has become one of freedom of navigation rights that trading nations require . <p> And yet , it must be added that economic relations have continued and even expanded between China and the countries with which it has conflicting territorial claims in the South China Sea . This also includes those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries . <p> Legal victory on the Law of the Sea issue , which the Philippines won against China , is a reminder that many countries are on the side of our basic position . <p> The hawks on our side on the China Sea issue want strong assertion of Philippine rights in our territorial claims . Direct confrontation could only heighten bad outcomes for us . Former president Rodrigo Duterte 's tack to downplay this approach , as foolhardy as it was , was realistic . We are no match to China 's military prowess . <p> All the other countries involved in the South China Sea problem have essentially followed a no-conflict approach . A useful approach to deal with it is to liven up some form of alliances with other countries concerned by the military developments in the area . Only the big boys -- the big military powers -- can be provocative and get away with it . <p> ASEAN as a group had foreseen the potential for conflict years ago by insisting on a " Code of Conduct " along the sea-lanes that all trading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet been adopted , it is a good point to assert as a group .

Also , by expanding the scope of economic cooperation and trade , it is possible to keep both countries occupied on positive developments . <p> In due time , expanding interests on both sides lead to the search for compromises and useful solutions to the big irritant issues . Hence , it is a good approach to enhance other types of engagements on a bilateral front . <p> It is also important to point out that the US-Philippine alliance -- a friendship rooted in historical relationships -- helps to buttress our military position .

Many of the agreements on improving the economic relationships were already items of general agreement between the two countries . <p> Some of these agreements would have been concluded without a visit to China by our president .

Probers have yet to announce the likely motive for the murder . <p> Sadly , the brutality is not unique , and Ranara is not the first Pinay whose dream of a better life turned into a nightmare . <p> As early as January 2018 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of seven Filipino household service workers ( HSW ) due to suspected abuse . <p> A total deployment ban was imposed the next month , after the body of another HSW , Joanna Demafelis , was found stuffed in a freezer in an apartment abandoned by her employers , a Lebanese and his Syrian wife . Demafelis was believed to have been dead for over a year . <p> Kuwait tried the murderers in absentia and sentenced them to death , but the two are still facing the judicial process in their respective countries . <p> Meanwhile , a bilateral agreement was drawn up between the Philippines and Kuwait to strengthen protection of OFWs . The deployment ban was eased and then lifted as the agreement went into effect . But the terms failed to protect another Pinay HSW , Ma . Constancia Dayag , 47 .

The scenario is not farfetched ; there have been numerous reports of such cases . <p> Domestic helpers , nearly all of them women , are particularly vulnerable , especially in places where there is strong social stratification and certain sectors are treated as second-class humans . Many HSWs work alone in their employer 's home , in an environment that inspires psychotic employers to give full rein to their inner beast . <p> The horror stories about Pinay HSWs have been well publicized , but many are undeterred . Cacdac told us that from 10,000 to 15,000 Filipinos have been deployed to Kuwait annually in recent years .

While voice BPO , where the Philippines is a leader , is unlikely to disappear anytime soon , it is rapidly being overtaken by skills BPO . <p> We can not adapt to this shift if our 10-year-old students are performing poorly in something as basic as reading comprehension . <p> In the meantime , regulation of recruitment agencies can use improvement . Migrante 's Hernando told us that even if an agency or its operator has been blacklisted or shut down because of the bad experience of clients , it is so easy for the agency to simply register under a different name or tie up with another agency , and resume recruitment . <p> The toughest aspect of this problem , of course , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories , endure long separation with their loved ones , and seek greener pastures overseas . <p> The Department of Foreign Affairs maintains that Ayungin Shoal is part of the exclusive economic zone and continental shelf of the Philippines , therefore giving Filipino fishermen the right to " take whatever they are due " while in the area . <p> Today being Sunday , a day of rest at least in the Christian church , it 's fitting that I share with you a story about a pilot who , after 29 years of flying tens of thousands of passengers , is putting down his wings . <p> While no criminal charges will be filed against the 10 Philippine Airlines crew members for bringing in 27 kilos of onions from the Middle East , the Bureau of Customs is considering filing a complaint against them for supposedly unruly behavior.

" <h> The West , where danger lurks everywhere <p> Malone 's Nuggets ( 41-18 ) certainly hope to be one of those teams in the championship hunt . The past two seasons , Denver has entered the playoffs without a meaningful chance to make a deep playoff run , especially after Jamal Murray tore his ACL in April 2021 and missed 18 months . <p> The Suns ( 32-28 ) did land Durant , but the price they paid -- four first-round picks , a swap , plus Mikal Bridges and Cam Johnson -- means winning a championship is the lone path to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very strongly about our ambitions to winning a championship , " Irving said during All-Star Weekend .

" <h> The East , where clear contenders have emerged <p> While Irving might believe the West presents more of a challenge , the data shows Boston ( 42-17 ) has been the league 's best team virtually all season . The Celtics are the only team with a top-5 ranking in both offensive and defensive efficiency , thanks to star power at the top in wings Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown , combined with a rotation that goes 10-plus deep with versatile options for newly promoted head coach Joe Mazzulla . <p> Only a half-game back of Boston , however , are the Bucks ( 41-17 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available this season -- a reality that will linger a bit longer as Giannis Antetokounmpo deals with a right wrist injury .

He showed flashes of his potential in that role with 45 points in a win against Miami right before the break . <p> And then there 's Cleveland ( 38-23 ) , the team that has n't made the playoffs without LeBron James since 1997-98 and has n't won a playoff series without him in three decades . The idea of just making the playoffs being seen as a success for the Cavaliers has given way to what should be , presuming health , Cleveland being a presumptive favorite to win a round when the playoffs get underway . <p> " I think at the end of the day we have a group of guys that they put the time and the work in throughout the regular season , " Mitchell said during All-Star Weekend .

" <p> There is plenty of pressure to go around . The trade deadline saw 49 players moved -- the most in league history and more than 10% of the league -- and all but the Cavaliers and Chicago Bulls made deals . <p> All of which sets the stage for a six-week sprint to the end of the regular season , with an all but certain whirlwind postseason to follow . <p> " I think it 's going to be a wild and crazy postseason , " Malone said .

@@97546234 <h> Preschool edition of family love and laughter ' play list ' <p> LAST week , I discussed my " play list " for toddlers . I enumerated five types of activities that can build toddler-needed skills in a fun and play-based approach . There is no need to worry if your preschoolers were not able to go through the toddler activities I laid out . Your preschoolers are still in their formative years . They will be open to preschool activities if we make them as fun and loving as we can . <p> For my own preschoolers at the time , my husband and I decided to send my children to a traditional school with larger class sizes . However , at home and in their extra-curricular activities , I would augment with play-based and more explorative activities . I injected discipline with routines at home but allowed them to be free on their " hows " when they played . For example , during art time , I did not hover over what they would draw or whether they were coloring within the lines . <p> At this stage also , try to check how your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and understanding logic because they are the foundations of how information is picked up by children and how will perform in subjects in school . If you feel there is any topic your child is having difficulty on , try to tackle the " why " as well as the " what . " For example , when your child is having difficulty learning to read basic words , it might help to discuss with experts like teachers if the issue is really the reading skill , or might it have something to do with the child 's listening or logic skills . I am sure that like me , many parents ' main concern for their preschooler is how to make them " Big School Ready . " According to renowned developmental pediatrician Dr. Francis Xavier Dimalanta , in his Dr. D 's Happy Learning World Learning Boxes with Ogallala , we need to " provide activities that allow them to enjoy learning literacy and numeracy through games , puzzles and art-infused learning . We also build their confidence through developing critical thinking and motor skills through games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early childhood educator and a parent , I recommend play tools and activities that build our children 's skill-building , brain-building and socio-emotional learning ( SEL ) skills . My main emotional goals for my preschoolers then were their sense of security , patience , understanding how they learn , and them enjoying adventures . <p> These goals became the basis of how I picked the activities , as well as the play tools/toys , that I would buy and prepare each month . <p> Below were my top picks for building love and laughter as a family during my children 's preschool years : <p> 1 . Performing . We had weekend performance nights on some Saturdays , where each of us got to pick a song to sing and dance to . I remember my daughter 's phase of singing Katy Perry 's " Roar " so intensely . For boys , I would suggest bringing out your children 's stash of musical instruments , then let them choose their instrument . I remember Marcus picking a guitar and freely just played laughingly in front of us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violin for 8 years . <p> 2 . Puzzle play and games . Since both my husband and I were not the most patient people by nature , I researched on activities that can build patience . Aside from learning an instrument , I discovered puzzle play is a good play tool for this . I also discovered how the texture and thickness of a puzzle makes a difference in building a child 's interest in forming them . We started with wooden puzzles , then progressed to tangrams and thick cardboard puzzles . If the puzzle pieces were a lot for my preschooler , I would divide the puzzle into 4 , then would ask her to form a quarter of a puzzle , then I would do the rest . As we did it again , they we would do half each and so forth until they were able to do the whole puzzle themselves . We also played games each Saturday Game Night . Each family member chose their preferred game and waited for turn until their game was played . <p> 3 . Art and exploration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develop their soft motor and writing skills . On weekends , I also brought them to art museums and encouraged them to do their own " masterpieces " at home . We annually attend the art fair at The Link . Like in their toddler years , we also explored many places during weekends . I would bring them to science museums , zoos , and other provinces . There , we would learn about facts or see the real-life subjects from what they were learning in school . <p> 4 . Chores . This was a fun time for my children to get to try out the skills they learned during pretend play . Because their pretend play cooking or cleaning toys then were closest to the real tools as well as child-sized , they were eager to use real-life mixing bowls , wisks and other household tools in their preschool years . At least once a month in our weekend play nights would be either cooking or baking . I loved using IKEA kitchen tools because they had similar ones to my children 's Melissa and Doug toys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concept for social-media content is back at SM City Fairview .

The changes arrive during a period in which there are growing concerns among different governments about the app 's security and ability to alter its algorithm to push certain posts . <p> THERE is nothing quite like the bond between a cat and its owner . Earning your cat 's love is n't as hard as you might think . It 's all about taking steps to keep your cat healthy and happy , such as giving your pet the right cat food for every stage of its life . But with so many cat food options to choose from , where do you even begin ? <p> IN every office setting I have worked in , I realized it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone on how well they did at work . This might be the effect of a competitive environment , or due to people not becoming accustomed to appreciating others ' work because they themselves were not appreciated by their manager .

However , at some point , this will start to shrink by 2039 due to demographic shifts . <p> For one , Cruz explained that life expectancy of older people is getting longer because of advances in medicine , which means that payment of pension is also lengthened . <p> At the same time , the fertility rate of Filipinos is declining , thereby , lessening the worker to pensioner ratio . <p> Some 20 to 30 years ago , Cruz said , nine workers pay for contributions for one pensioner .

It covers future contributions based on the population , as well as future benefits for members . <p> " After 2054 , we will have debts , we can no longer pay in full the benefits of our SSS beneficiaries . We have an obligation to pay them beyond 2054 , but our fund will no longer be enough , " Cruz said . <p> Cruz said that in the short-term , SSS would remain in a good condition given that the fund life is until 2054 . <p> However , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perpetuity and should not have a deadline to be able to provide the full benefits to its members . <p> " If we increase the benefits to current claimants , we are necessarily depriving future generations of SSS members of the same amount .

" <p> Speaking to reporters for the first time since Rodgers made it known he wanted to play for the Jets , Gutekunst said he and Jets general manager Joe Douglas have been in regular contact -- and even talked briefly here at the meetings in Phoenix -- but that no deadline has been set to execute a trade . Gutekunst would n't rule out that it could take into the summer to finalize a deal ; waiting until after June 1 would allow the Packers to spread some of the salary cap hit onto their books for 2024 , but it would mean no compensation in terms of 2023 draft help . <p> The Jets have reportedly been unwilling to deal their first-round pick this year ( No. 13 overall ) , but Gutekunst said there are ways to do the trade without that pick . <p> " That 's not a necessity , " Gutekunst said .

" I think that would be best for everybody , but we 'll see how that goes . " <p> Gutekunst has until May to pick up the fifth-year option for the 2024 season on Love 's rookie contract , and while Gutekunst did n't say when or if the Packers will , he made it clear that moving on from Rodgers is in part due to his confidence in Love . <p> " I think it 's really a credit to Jordan how he 's handled that and how professional he 's been through this , him and his representatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of constant communication with them and him , and I think he 's got a really good outlook on this .

Judge has been an MVP contender every time he has played a full season , and there 's no reason that wo n't be the case again in 2023. -- Gonzalez <p> One ( realistic ) bold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 47 . And a bunch of other superlative statistics . He does n't win the MVP , but he finishes third . -- Schoenfield <p> What 's changed most since we saw them last : The Dodgers saw a mass exodus of veteran talent over the winter , a big-name group that ranged from a former MVP in Cody Bellinger to a possible future MVP in Trea Turner to a franchise icon in Justin Turner . This version of the Dodgers will look very different , but one thing that has n't changed in Chavez Ravine : the expectation to win the World Series . -- Doolittle <h> Sign up for free fantasy baseball <p> The season will be a success if ... They win an NL West title and a World Series . The Dodgers won the NL West in nine of the past 10 seasons , and the one season they did n't win it , they still won 106 games . Yes , they have more holes than they 've had in a long time , but the lineup still has Freddie Freeman , Mookie Betts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Julio Urias , Clayton Kershaw , Dustin May , Tony Gonsolin ( although he wo n't be ready for Opening Day ) and Noah Syndergaard , plus two of the top pitching prospects in the game in Bobby Miller and Gavin Stone . So yeah , this season will be a success if it follows the path of other recent seasons . -- Schoenfield <p> Most likely 2023 award winner : Perhaps being ranked ninth in our 2023 top 100 will anger Betts enough that he 'll go out and win another MVP . At 30 years old , he remains arguably the best all-around position player in the sport , capable of beating teams with his glove , arm , bat and feet . There might not be a more natural athlete around . If you do n't believe us , just wait until you see him play second base this year . -- Gonzalez <p> One ( realistic ) bold prediction : For all the talk about the Padres ' big four hitters , let 's go with this : Freeman , Betts , Smith and Martinez will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bogaerts . We 'll use batting runs above average from Baseball-Reference . Check back in October . -- Schoenfield <p> What 's changed most since we saw them last : The payroll ? The Mets have spared no expense in building a roster that is long on star power and looks pretty deep as well . Yet there is a major void that opened up late in spring training when Edwin Diaz , the top current reliever in baseball , injured his knee during a postgame celebration at the WBC . Ouch . A bright , bright spotlight will now shine on relievers David Robertson , Adam Ottavino , Brooks Raley and , perhaps most of all , manager Buck Showalter when the season begins . -- Doolittle <p> The season will be a success if ... Let 's just say that owner Steve Cohen does n't have any vacations to Hawaii planned for the first week of November . Remember to leave a couple of additional days for a ticker-tape parade , Steve ! -- Schoenfield <p> Most likely 2023 award winner : Max Scherzer and Justin Verlander are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious reasons -- late in their careers , still pitching at the height of their powers , and now making up the best rotation tandem in the major leagues . Scherzer and Verlander boast six Cy Young Awards between them , including Verlander 's from last season . They 'll fall off at some point , but there have been scant signs of that thus far . Until they prove otherwise , they 'll continue to vie for more Cy Youngs , including this season . -- Gonzalez <p> One ( realistic ) bold prediction : With Diaz out , Robertson leads the team in saves . But David Bednar will be the closer when the Mets reach the postseason , after he comes over in a trade with the Pirates . -- Schoenfield <p> What 's changed most since we saw them last : In the wake of a major knee injury suffered late in spring training by slugger Rhys Hoskins , there is some fancy navigating ahead for second-year manager Rob Thomson . The Phillies ' position group did n't seem particularly deep to begin with , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returns later this season is now made that much harder . Can Thomson juggle the challenge of hanging with the Mets and Braves while keeping his veterans from wearing down by the time Harper returns ? -- Doolittle <p> The season will be a success if ... The Phillies can match last year 's exciting playoff run . They 'll need to hang in there until Harper returns , and they ca n't afford any injuries to the rotation , but let 's see if last October 's momentum carries over into 2023. -- Schoenfield <p> Most likely 2023 award winner : As he nears his 30s , Trea Turner really seems to be coming into his own offensively , providing a speed-power combination that might be rivaled by only Betts . With Harper and Hoskins out , Turner , signed to an 11-year , $300 million contract this offseason , will need to step up at the top of the lineup . The bigger bases and the limited pickoffs might give him just enough of an extra boost to finish within the top three in MVP voting for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bold prediction : Did you watch the World Baseball Classic ? If you did , this prediction hardly qualifies as courageous . It 's about as bold as wearing shorts and a T-shirt the first day the temperature turns 60 degrees : Trea Turner for National League MVP. -- Schoenfield <p> What 's changed most since we saw them last : Ever since the Blue Jays rose back into the ranks of contenders in 2020 , they 've been trying to fill in the cracks to solidify a title-contending roster . This offseason saw the addition of Kevin Kiermaier and Daulton Varsho , along with the departure of Teoscar Hernandez , leaving Toronto with a team defense that could leap from average to elite . -- Doolittle <p> The season will be a success if ... They win the AL East ... make it to the ALCS ... and make it to the World Series for the first time since Joe Carter had his big moment in 1993 . After back-to-back seasons of 91 and 92 wins , the Jays have the talent and the expectations to think bigger than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the minimum . Their World Series dreams might depend on Jose Berrios bouncing back and Vladimir Guerrero Jr . coming closer to his 2021 numbers , but the 1-2 punch of Kevin Gausman and Alek Manoah could be the best in the AL and gives them World Series dreams . -- Schoenfield <h> 2023 MLB Season Preview <p> Opening Day is March 30 ! Here 's what you need to get ready for a new season . <p> Most likely 2023 award winner : Manoah is only 25 , and yet he 's already one of the game 's best pitchers . He made that big a leap in his second full season , ultimately finishing third in AL Cy Young voting in 2022 . He 'll only be better now that he 's a year older and will be backed by a better outfield defense -- especially since Manoah generated more weak contact than he did strikeouts last year . -- Gonzalez <p> One ( realistic ) bold prediction : New outfielder Varsho goes 30-30 , joining Shawn Green and Jose Cruz Jr . as the only Blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 16 steals last year for Arizona ? Look for Varsho 's average and OBP to go up without the shift , giving him more opportunities to run . -- Schoenfield <p> What 's changed most since we saw them last : The second half of last season was dominated by the farewell tours of Yadier Molina and Albert Pujols . Now , those two Redbirds legends have indeed said farewell and a new era in St. Louis baseball is at hand . Most of the faces are familiar , including Molina 's replacement behind the plate , former Cub Willson Contreras . The big difference is that Cardinals fans will no longer be rooting against him . -- Doolittle <p> The season will be a success if ... They reach the World Series . The Cardinals seem content to win what has been a soft division in recent seasons , in addition to around 90 games . But they 've also gone 1-9 in their past four playoff series , losing the wild-card series in 2020 and 2022 , the wild-card game in 2021 and getting swept in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? They do have some exciting prospects on the way , but if Paul Goldschmidt and Nolan Arenado slip from their high level of 2022 , even the division title is n't a guarantee . -- Schoenfield <p> Most likely 2023 award winner : Jordan Walker , the No. 14 prospect on Kiley McDaniel 's Top 100 , torched through spring training and showed he might be ready to handle major league pitching at the age of 20 . The Cardinals have announced he will be on the Opening Day roster , now it is a matter of finding ways to get him in the lineup . Originally a third baseman who could transition to first , Walker has adjusted pretty well to the corner outfield , a necessity with Goldschmidt and Arenado on the roster . His power is off the charts . And we could see that translate to the big leagues soon enough to make a Rookie of the Year run . -- Gonzalez <p> What 's changed most since we saw them last : With multiple additions -- Kolten Wong to bolster the defense , Tommy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anchor the lineup from the cleanup spot -- the Mariners have a more balanced and dynamic group of hitters who , as a collective , should play better team defense as well . -- Doolittle <p> The season will be a success if ... The Mariners ended their long playoff drought last year and even tasted postseason victory with the wild-card win over Toronto . This year it means going ... ahh , let 's just say it : One step further would be nice , but two steps further and reaching the first World Series in franchise history is what this team believes it can achieve . And if you can reach the World Series ... -- Schoenfield <p> Most likely 2023 award winner : Last season , Julio Rodriguez cracked the Opening Day roster at the age of 21 and became a star almost immediately ( we say " almost " because , if you 'll remember , April was a struggle ) . Rodriguez wowed the fans of Seattle in the batter 's box , on the bases and in the field , and his smile and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will Year 2 bring ? It 's fun to simply consider the possibilities . The reigning Rookie of the Year should elevate himself to MVP status . -- Gonzalez <p> One ( realistic ) bold prediction : We could predict Luis Castillo to win the Cy Young Award or George Kirby to start the All-Star Game ( which is in Seattle ) or Logan Gilbert to win 20 games , but it 's more fun to do something with Julio . Let 's say he finishes second in the MVP voting ( Ohtani goes chalk ) and does so while hitting 40 home runs . He hit 27 over his final 99 games last year -- a 41-homer pace over 150 games . Only 10 players age 22 or younger have hit 40 home runs in a season ( Eddie Mathews did it twice ) . Three have done it since 2019 : Vladimir Guerrero Jr. , Fernando Tatis Jr . and Ronald Acuna Jr . And guess what ? Julio 's dad 's name is ... Julio Sr. So that makes him a Junior as well . -- Schoenfield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : A team known for roster churn had relatively little of it over the winter , but the Rays did bid farewell to longtime center fielder Kiermaier in their ongoing bid to keep as many in-their-prime producers in key spots as possible . Beyond that , the hope is for better health from stalwarts like Brandon Lowe , Pete Fairbanks and Tyler Glasnow. -- Doolittle <h> 2023 MLB Rank : Who 's No. 1 ? <p> We ranked and made predictions for the best 100 players in the sport for the upcoming 2023 season.Top 100 list ? <p> The season will be a success if ... They return to the postseason for the fifth consecutive season . That might be a tough ask in the AL East and with the improved teams in the AL West , but the AL East has had three playoff teams each of the past two seasons . Going all the way ? The lineup seems to lack that superstar linchpin , although maybe it gets there if Lowe hits again and Wander Franco improves . But the Rays hit .211 in their playoff loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in two games in their wild-card loss to the Guardians in 2022. -- Schoenfield <p> Most likely 2023 award winner : Shane McClanahan was the AL 's best pitcher in the first half last year , posting a 1.71 ERA and 147 strikeouts in 110 ? innings . He faded down the stretch , then worked on his body over the offseason in hopes that that will never happen again . He should be a prime Cy Young contender in 2023. -- Gonzalez <p> One ( realistic ) bold prediction : All the projection systems have Franco hitting .280-something -- barely above the .277 mark from last season , when injuries affected his playing time and perhaps his production . Let 's call for a breakout season and predict a batting title with a .321 average . -- Schoenfield <p> What 's changed most since we saw them last : The youthful , scrapping Guardians you saw in last year 's playoffs return largely intact , albeit a year older , wiser and perhaps more confident after 2022 's surprising success . There 's a new presence in the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a free agent to help a lineup long on speed and contact ability crystallize into a more dynamic form . -- Doolittle <p> The season will be a success if ... The Guardians return every decent player from a 92-win team , and while not prohibitive favorites in the AL Central , they are certainly favored to win it again . That means they should absolutely have World Series aspirations . Whether they have enough power to get there is the big question . -- Schoenfield <p> Most likely 2023 award winner : There might not be a more consistent all-around player in the sport than the criminally underrated Jose Ramirez , who has finished within the top six in AL MVP voting five of the past six years . He 's a complete hitter , a superb defender and a dangerous base stealer without the flashy tools . He should once again be good for a batting average around .300 , 20-plus home runs , 20-plus stolen bases , triple-digit RBIs and somewhere in the neighborhood of 7.0 fWAR. -- Gonzalez <p> One ( realistic ) bold prediction : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Andres Gimenez bats second ( as he should ) rather than Amed Rosario . That gives them two solid on-base guys without a ton of power at the top of the lineup , Ramirez batting third and Bell cleanup . Which means a ton of RBI opportunities for Bell . Put it this way : Cleveland 's cleanup hitters were terrible last season ( .693 OPS ) and still drove in 95 runs . So Bell will lead the AL in RBIs. -- Schoenfield <p> What 's changed most since we saw them last : The front office is different , with Matt Arnold taking over at general manager for David Stearns , who stepped down . You would n't know it by Milwaukee 's offseason moves , which had a similar flavor to past hot stoves . That 's not a bad thing . Meanwhile , some anticipated position players are pushing through , with Brice Turang likely taking over at second , Garrett Mitchell in center and prospects like Sal Frelick and Jackson Chourio not far away . -- Doolittle <p> The season will be a success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NL Central title.The general consensus sees the Brewers taking a step back after missing the playoffs last year for the first time since 2017 , but any team with Corbin Burnes and Brandon Woodruff fronting the rotation has a puncher 's chance . If they can clinch the division , that 's a huge win . -- Schoenfield <p> Most likely 2023 award winner : Burnes seemingly had a bit of a dip in production coming off his Cy Young Award in 2021 , but he topped 200 innings for the first time , led the NL in strikeouts and still fashioned a 2.94 ERA in 2022 . The 28-year-old right-hander remains one of the sport 's best pitchers . And if his home run rate comes back to normal , he 'll make another run at a Cy Young . Perhaps he 'll find some added fuel in his anger toward the Brewers ' arbitration process . -- Gonzalez <p> One ( realistic ) bold prediction : The Brewers lead the NL in home runs . Hey , they were second a year ago ( albeit 34 behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adames in the 30-homer club . Less bold : Burnes takes home his second Cy Young Award . Power and starting pitching ? Do n't overlook the Brewers . -- Schoenfield <p> What 's changed most since we saw them last : The Twins will have a rotation bolstered by the acquisition of Pablo Lopez and the return of Kenta Maeda . But perhaps the biggest change will be the identity of Minnesota 's Gold Glove-caliber center fielder . At the start of the season , at least , it 'll be trade acquisition Michael A. Taylor . Meanwhile , in another load management initiative , the Twins will make Byron Buxton the most athletic DH in the history of the game . -- Doolittle <h> MLB Opening Week on ESPN <p> Opening Week is finally here ! Tune in for the start of the 2023 season with some of the biggest early matchups . <p> The season will be a success if ... They win the AL Central AND beat the Yankees in a playoff series . That 's right , we 're skipping right past " win a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18 in a row ) and going straight to winning a series . -- Schoenfield <p> Most likely 2023 award winner : Carlos Correa is here to stay , on the heels of a massive free agent contract -- and a roller-coaster free agency -- that will make him the face of the Twins for the next ... well , six years at least . He 's a feared hitter and a strong defender at a premium position who is still -- amazingly -- only 28 years old . And given the unique structure of his contract , he 'll be extra motivated to put up MVP numbers . Correa has yet to finish within the top three in MVP voting . If he 's healthy , that might change in 2023. -- Gonzalez <p> One ( realistic ) bold prediction : Joe Ryan wins 17 games and finishes with a sub-3.00 ERA and in the top five of Cy Young voting . -- Schoenfield <p> What 's changed most since we saw them last : The Angels ' active roster to begin the season -- before any injuries -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than enough quality arms for a six-man rotation . Additions to the position player group have given manager Phil Nevin more lineup flexibility and a better bench . The bullpen ? Well , the rest of the roster looks good . -- Doolittle <p> The season will be a success if ... Ohtani finishes the season in an Angels uniform ... and then starts the first game of a playoff series . -- Schoenfield <p> Most likely 2023 award winner : We 'll go with two here , because it 's fitting : Ohtani and Trout -- our No. 1- and No. 2-ranked players , respectively , heading into the 2023 season -- both vying for the AL MVP . They boast nine top-two finishes for the AL MVP between them and look like the favorites to finish 1 and 2 this year , in whatever order . Ohtani is only getting better as a two-way player and could be in for a big year -- perhaps his biggest yet -- leading up to free agency . Trout is still only 31 . And when healthy , he still looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . -- Gonzalez <p> One ( realistic ) bold prediction : Picking Ohtani to win the MVP is n't exactly as daring as , say , when the White Sox thought it was a good idea to wear shorts ( that idea lasted three games ) . How about a Cy Young Award then ? He finished fourth a year ago , and the issue is if he can pitch enough innings to merit stronger consideration . He pitched 166 last year -- but that was only nine fewer than Verlander threw in winning it and one less than Burnes threw when he won in 2021 . So , a few more deep starts or maybe an extra one or two -- more likely if the Angels are in the playoff race -- and he can get to 175 or 180 innings and pull it off . -- Schoenfield <p> What 's changed most since we saw them last : Not much -- except pretty much everything . The Rangers have a new brain trust with a Chris Young-led front office and a Hall of Fame-bound manager in Bruce Bochy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weathered glove . And , also , there is an all-new rotation that the Rangers have purchased over the past year-plus , led by **39;1423;TOOLONG Jacob deGrom. -- Doolittle <p> The season will be a success if ... They sneak into the playoffs , which they last made in 2016 . It 's a big jump from 68 wins to the postseason , especially in a league where five teams won 90 games a year ago and seven did so in 2021 , but the Rangers are aiming for something more than just a .500 finish considering the way they have spent the past two offseasons. -- Schoenfield <p> Most likely 2023 award winner : DeGrom 's five-year , $185 million free agent contract stunned a lot of people in the industry , given both his age and injury history . But it underscored an important point : When healthy , nobody is better . DeGrom followed his run of back-to-back Cy Young Awards in 2018 and 2019 with a 2.05 ERA and 352 strikeouts in 224 1/3 innings . The problem , of course , is that those innings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he avoids the injured list , deGrom will undoubtedly contend for another Cy Young . Let 's hope that 's the case . We just want to see him out there . -- Gonzalez <p> One ( realistic ) bold prediction : Hmm , we already predicted Shohei Ohtani to win the AL Cy Young Award , and doubling up is not allowed , so we 'll stay away from deGrom ( probably a wise decision ) . Let 's instead go with Corey Seager and Marcus Semien becoming the first middle-infield duo in MLB history with 35 home runs apiece . The only team with even two 30-homer middle infielders was ... you 'll never get it ... do n't even try to guess ... the 2008 Marlins with Hanley Ramirez ( 33 ) and Dan Uggla ( 32 ) . -- Schoenfield <p> What 's changed most since we saw them last : The most significant difference between the Orioles on the first day of spring this year as opposed to last year is expectation . That 'll happen when you jump from 52 wins in 2021 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have outstripped the Orioles ' rate of actual improvement . -- Doolittle <p> The season will be a success if ... It includes a trip to the postseason . Many are expecting the Orioles to take a step back after perhaps not doing enough to address pitching concerns , but if rookies Gunnar Henderson and Grayson Rodriguez match Adley Rutschman 's 2022 star rookie turn , they could surprise . -- Schoenfield <p> Most likely 2023 award winner : Henderson entered the season as the No. 1 prospect on Kiley McDaniel 's rankings and stands as the odds-on favorite to win the AL Rookie of the Year Award . That should n't surprise anyone . Henderson , 21 , is an above-average defender at third base who brings plus power and an advanced feel for the strike zone . And he gets better every year . -- Gonzalez <p> One ( realistic ) bold prediction : Rutschman will start the All-Star Game . That 's not the bold prediction . This is : He leads the AL in on-base percentage . Aaron Judge led last year with a .425 mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half . -- Schoenfield <p> What 's changed most since we saw them last : The White Sox saw 2020 AL MVP Jose Abreu depart , and his absence leaves a production and leadership void that Chicago hopes to fill organically . Andrew Vaughn will get his first crack as an everyday first baseman , and power-hitting rookie Oscar Colas might end up as the regular in right . -- Doolittle <p> The season will be a success if ... They win the AL Central and do some damage in the playoffs . This team has the same strengths as the one that won 93 games two years ago . With better health , the expectations for this year 's team should be just as high , especially with several potential bounce-back candidates in Lucas Giolito , Yasmani Grandal and Yoan Moncada. -- Schoenfield <h> MLB offseason recap <p> Not sure what to make of your team 's offseason moves ? We 've got you covered . <p> Most likely 2023 award winner : It took a historic season from Justin Verlander to prevent Dylan Cease from winning the AL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2.20 ERA and 227 strikeouts , albeit with 78 walks ) were just as good as his peripheral ones ( he ranked within the top 10% in the sport in hard-hit rate , expected batting average and expected slugging percentage ) . His age-27 season could be a big one . -- Gonzalez <p> One ( realistic ) bold prediction : Vaughn ranked in the 90th percentile in hard-hit rate last year . His swing-and-miss rate was in the 74th percentile . He 's entering his age-25 season and has two years of major league experience . The skills are here to make a leap . He needs to get the ball in the air more often and to improve his chase rate . I predict he does that and hits .275 with 30 home runs . -- Schoenfield <p> What 's changed most since we saw them last : The middle infield is gone . The Red Sox lost Xander Bogaerts to free agency and Trevor Story to injury . The Red Sox 's signing of Japanese outfielder Masataka Yoshida at least must look a lot more exciting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the WBC. -- Doolittle <p> The season will be a success if ... They make the playoffs . That should be the goal every year for this franchise , but the reality is the Red Sox have yo-yoed back and forth for the past decade between postseason glory and last-place ignominy . In the past 10 full seasons , they have two World Series titles -- and four last-place finishes . No other team operates like this . Throw in last place in 2020 , and that 's five basement finishes in 11 seasons . Many believe that 's where the Sox are headed in 2023 , but there 's enough talent here to defy the experts of Red Sox Nation . -- Schoenfield <p> Most likely 2023 award winner : Rafael Devers has never finished within the top 10 in MVP voting , and this should be the year that changes . He 's the undisputed face of the franchise after signing a 10-year , $313.5 million extension . He is one of the sport 's most well-rounded hitters , and he made some nice strides defensively last season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Yoshida proves the $90 million investment -- one that many in the game questioned -- worthwhile , at least in his first season , hitting .297 with a .385 OBP and scoring 100 runs . -- Schoenfield <p> What 's changed most since we saw them last : The Cubs added veteran Jameson Taillon to work at the front of a deep rotation . Still , the most stark changes are on the position-player side . Chicago remade its lineup with a half-dozen free agent signings , with the most notable being premier shortstop Dansby Swanson and 2019 NL MVP Cody Bellinger , who will look to get his career back on track at Wrigley Field . -- Doolittle <p> The season will be a success if ... They get back over .500 and make a nice run at the playoffs while some of last season 's younger players continue to grow -- guys like Justin Steele , Christopher Morel , Hayden Wesneski and Javier Assad . Matt Mervis could displace Eric Hosmer at first base during the season as well . What the Cubs really need for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to develop , so top prospects Pete Crow-Armstrong , Kevin Alcantara and Brennen Davis will need to show they 'll be pounding on the big league door for 2024. -- Schoenfield <p> Most likely 2023 award winner : Bellinger is too talented and still too young to have really fallen off so much . At some point you have to trust the sample size , though , and 1,143 plate appearances -- during which he slashed .203/.272/.376 in the three seasons that followed his MVP -- is quite the substantive one . But we 've seen some flashes of greatness from Bellinger in that stretch , and the 27-year-old center fielder should be better in a new environment and with more time removed from shoulder surgery . He 's a prime candidate for NL Comeback Player of the Year . -- Gonzalez <p> One ( realistic ) bold prediction : The Cubs stay in the race until the final week of the season with the up-the-middle defense playing a key role . Swanson and Nico Hoerner win Gold Gloves as the Cubs climb from 10th in the NL in runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's changed most since we saw them last : Arizona has the look of a club that is coming together fast , a process aided by a roster-balancing offseason deal that sent Daulton Varsho to Toronto in exchange for the D-backs ' catcher of the present and future , Gabriel Moreno . With 23-year-old Alek Thomas patrolling center field and Corbin Carroll flanking him as a leading NL Rookie of the Year candidate , the skies over Phoenix are growing even brighter . -- Doolittle <h> MLB 2023 Rule Changes <p> From bigger bases to the pitch clock , baseball will look very different this season . Here 's what you need to know . <p> The season will be a success if ... Just two years ago the Diamondbacks lost 110 games , including a remarkable 8-48 record in May and June , so the fact that we 're already talking about them as a potential surprise playoff contender is a rapid improvement . It 's probably a year too soon to view the D-backs as serious contenders when the top NL teams are so stacked , so let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outfield leading the way is a reasonable goal . -- Schoenfield <p> Most likely 2023 award winner : We could have easily gone with Zac Gallen for the NL Cy Young Award here given the strides he made in 2022 , but Carroll is the favorite for the NL Rookie of the Year Award for obvious reasons . Carroll , 22 , produced an .830 OPS in a 32-game major league sample last year -- near the end of his first full season of professional baseball , mind you -- and brings the type of all-around game that could make him the sport 's best rookie in 2023. -- Gonzalez <p> One ( realistic ) bold prediction : The Diamondbacks signed Carroll to an eight-year , $111 million extension ( $134 million with the ninth-year option ) , so you know what they think about him . He 's Kiley McDaniel 's No. 2 overall prospect , so predicting him to win NL Rookie of the Year honors is an easy choice . But let 's go with some big numbers as well : 20 home runs , 40 stolen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to the top 10 of the MVP voting . -- Schoenfield <p> What 's changed most since we saw them last : Some of the names are different . Michael Conforto , Sean Manaea and Ross Stripling are in . Carlos Rodon and Evan Longoria are out . But the same dynamic -- depth , versatility , making every percentage play -- remains in effect . It can work , but it 's a bit of a letdown after the Giants were attached to such superstar names as Aaron Judge and Carlos Correa over the winter . -- Doolittle <p> The season will be a success if ... They win 90 games and make the playoffs . The Giants predictably fell off from their 107-win season in 2021 , finishing .500 . They lost Carlos Rodon and failed to land Judge or Correa . Mitch Haniger already has an oblique issue . Still , the Giants hope they can piece together a strong offense like they did in 2021 and Logan Webb leads a rotation that could be better than many expect ( with rookie Kyle Harrison joining at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ award winner : Webb elevated to another level last year , going 15-9 with a 2.90 ERA in nearly 200 innings while sporting the fourth-lowest home run rate in the majors . Only Framber Valdez generated more ground balls than the sinker-heavy Webb , whose steady effectiveness could place him in the Cy Young discussion in 2023. -- Gonzalez <p> One ( realistic ) bold prediction : David Villar leads the Giants in home runs ( 27 ) and RBIs ( 85 ) . -- Schoenfield <p> What 's changed most since we saw them last : Little by little , the Marlins are inching toward respectability with a roster built around a deep and potentially dynamic rotation .

Picollo beginning his first full season as head of the front office and Matt Quatraro dropping some Rays-inspired wisdom in the dugout .

He can make another leap in his age-26 season and vault into the Cy Young conversation . But he 'll need to limit hard contact . -- Gonzalez <p> One ( realistic ) bold prediction : Witt Jr . goes 50/30 -- 50 stolen bases and 30 home runs . The only two players to do that : Eric Davis in 1987 and Barry Bonds in 1990. -- Schoenfield <p> What 's changed most since we saw them last : The rebuilding Pirates added 105 years of human existence to form a new middle of the lineup consisting of Andrew McCutchen , Carlos Santana and Ji-Man Choi .

He has just 47 games above A-ball , but Kiley McDaniel 's No. 9 overall prospect has ridiculous tools and a huge ceiling if it comes together . -- Schoenfield <p> Most likely 2023 award winner : A 6-foot-5 shortstop with 70-grade power , speed and arm strength , who slashed .945 in high A and Double-A last year ? Let 's hope De La Cruz comes up early enough to make a real run at the NL Rookie of the Year Award -- mostly because it 's going to be so much fun to watch him play . -- Gonzalez <p> One ( realistic ) bold prediction : Hunter Greene leads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burnes led last year with 243 and Zack Wheeler led in 2021 with 247 , so we 're talking 240-plus K 's . Greene averaged 11.7 K 's per nine in 125 ? innings last year , making 24 starts . If he can get to 175 innings and average 12.4 K 's per nine , that 's 241 strikeouts. -- Schoenfield <p> What 's changed most since we saw them last : The A 's added veterans Shintaro Fujinami and Drew Rucinski to stabilize a rotation that will work in front of what appears to be a serviceable bullpen . That 's good because this group does n't figure to score many runs . -- Doolittle <p> The season will be a success if ... The plumbing holds up ? They draw a million fans ? They score 600 runs ? They hit higher than .216 ? Hey , the A 's had a nice run from 2018 to 2021 with the fifth-most wins in the majors . It 's going to take a couple more years -- at least -- to get back to that level . -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , acquired in the August trade that sent Frankie Montas to the Yankees , maintained rookie eligibility for the 2023 season and could challenge for the award despite what seems like a deep field . Waldichuk , 25 , is a left-hander with a funky delivery who brings advanced feel and command and what looks like a legitimate four-pitch mix . He wo n't blow you away with his radar-gun readings , but he 's more polished than most rookies. -- Gonzalez <p> One ( realistic ) bold prediction : Esteury Ruiz leads the majors with 70 stolen bases , the first player to reach that total since Jacoby Ellsbury in 2009 . That 's exciting , but the best news is it will mean he hits well enough to remain in the lineup on an everyday basis . -- Schoenfield <p> What 's changed most since we saw them last : The rebuild continues in D.C. , which should keep Nats fans focused on the most dynamic young players on the roster . That group includes catcher Keibert Ruiz , who has already signed on for the long haul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really be featured under the new set of MLB rules ; and lefty starter MacKenzie Gore . -- Doolittle <p> The season will be a success if ...

How often do you see a woman that 's 5-foot-10 ? " asked Flair . " OK , so how often do you see two of them ? " <p> They are the powerhouses of the women 's division , along with Raw women 's champion Bianca Belair , who might not have their height ( 5-foot-7 ) but is equally strong .

" <p> The three strut confidently down the trail blazed by the likes of Madusa , Chyna and Beth Phoenix , forging their own path for future superstars to redefine the women 's division . <p> Here 's a look at what makes Ripley , Belair and Flair so formidable in stature and status . <h> David Dennis Jr. : Ripley 's channeling of Chyna takes ' Mami ' to new heights <p> Rhea Ripley 's storyline with Dominik Mysterio has a feeling of a callback to Chyna 's run with Eddie Guerrero . WWE <p> It 's easiest to draw a through line from Chyna to Rhea Ripley because the latter is the centerpiece of a 2023 remix of Chyna 's most famous post-DX storyline . In 2000 , Chyna entered a storyline where she was blocking all romantic advances from " Latino Heat " Eddie Guerrero . The two would put together a monthslong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's uniqueness came from Chyna being so much larger than her on-camera beaux , and they could actually resolve their problems in the ring . <p> Fast forward two decades and Ripley is in a storyline that came into form when she essentially manipulated Rey Mysterio 's son Dominik into joining the Judgment Day faction . The Ripley-Dominik dynamic was built on the back of what Chyna and Eddie did , but this time the seduction did n't come from smooth-talking and theatrics . Instead , it came from Rhea beating Dominik into submission , physically dominating him for weeks until he folded to her will . <h> Editor 's Picks <h> 1dDaniel Cormier <h> 7d <p> 1 Related <p> The reaction to Ripley beating up Dominik every week was also an evolution to a spectacle Chyna made famous : the towering woman at ringside being the muscle that beats up the men . When Chyna did it , it would get significant heat because the wrestling industry had n't seen anything like that before . When Ripley beats up a man , it just feels natural . <p> What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a male former world champion while also selling DDTs and hurricanrana from someone the size of Zelina Vega on a random episode of Smackdown ! And she does this without losing any of her credibility . Ripley is the rare giant who can sell moves in a way that elevates her opponent of any size without losing any of her intimidation . <p> Ripley vs . Flair promises to be a wrestling classic . The match could also signal a changing of the guard . A welcome to the second generation of the women 's revolution . If she wins , it 'll be hard not to salivate at the thought of a unification match between the two women -- Belair and Ripley -- who hold the future of WWE in their hands . They 're both box office draws and can have an Orton vs . Cena-esque rivalry to span the rest of their careers . <p> A Ripley-Belair rivalry would n't only solidify women 's wrestling as capable of putting as many butts in seats as men 's wrestling , it would also show the evolution of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vulnerable and challenged by other equally capable women without being put in matches against men to test their abilities . Chyna stood above all as the Ninth Wonder Of The World . Ripley stands tall as a wonder amongst other wonders , as that 's where the magic resides . <p> In 2021 , Bianca Belair stood across the former Sasha Banks , now known as New Japan Pro Wrestling 's Mercedes Mon ? , inside Raymond James Stadium in Tampa , Florida , and made history . It was a moment not only for professional wrestling but for Black people long maligned in their presentation in wrestling , period . <p> A year later , she brought a dream she had since she was a rookie in the business to life , combining historically Black college and university culture by tapping Texas Southern 's " Ocean of Soul " marching band to produce an eye-popping WrestleMania 38 entrance . Both moments ended with Belair hoisting up championship gold , a feat only a select group of superstars have achieved two years in a row . <p> " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ESPN . " I know I main evented WrestleMania 37 . I know I stole the show with Becky Lynch at WrestleMania 38 . But this is the biggest one yet . I have a chance to three-peat at WrestleMania . " <p> Legacy has become nearly synonymous with Belair during her first reign as RAW women 's champion . A victory over Asuka at WrestleMania 39 puts her one week shy of becoming the longest-reigning RAW women 's champion of all time , a title held by Lynch . She 's already the longest-reigning Black world champion in company history . Going into SoFi Stadium on April 1 , she 'll be one of four superstars to carry a major title from one WrestleMania to the next , joining Roman Reigns , Hulk Hogan , and " Macho Man " Randy Savage . <p> But those accolades still feel surreal for Belair , who gravitated toward wrestling after being a gymnast at an early age , an All-America hurdler at the University of Tennessee and later a CrossFit competitor and powerlifter . She wrote down her first promo on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd in Florida her plans for the future . That day gave birth to " The EST , " a confident character whose athletic feats gave greater gravitas toward any adjective she used to describe herself . <p> " I 've been able to carry being a track athlete and being in gymnastics and doing every sport in the book , " Belair said . " I was n't someone who was naturally talented as a wrestler so I had to work very hard to be at the top . In WWE , things can always come out of nowhere so I had to stay ready so I did n't have to get ready . " <p> 450 splash from the second rope ? Done it . Carry a 330-pound man around the ring in a mock-obstacle course ? Barely broke a sweat . Not bad for a woman who first needed to learn how to perform a headlock or a wristlock . <p> " I thought I was going to get fired , " she joked about her early days in NXT . <p> Since then , she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belong . When in NXT for four years , she looked different than the other rookies in her class because she did n't come from a wrestling background . She was n't an indie darling who cut her teeth in regional promotions across the country . She was a high-level athlete in three sports who improved over time to become one of the best in the world . Belair won the WWE Performance Center women 's combine title three times ( 2016 , 2018-19 ) , a decathlon-esque event that tests wrestler 's strength and athleticism , with her only real competition being rising WWE star Raquel Gonzales , a former basketball player at Texas A&amp;M-Kingsville . <p> " I 've been carrying that attitude and grit and determination since I was an athlete in my collegiate years into WWE , " Belair said .

Flair returned to action after seven months away from WWE -- and the fans cheered her . She challenged Rousey to an impromptu title match -- and the fans cheered her even more . <p> For Flair , this was new , as she was previously one of the WWE 's most reliable villains . <p> " I spent my whole career wanting people to boo me . Now , getting the reactions that I 'm getting , and it 's positive . It 's so rewarding , " Flair said . " I want to act like it 's no big deal . But I 've been booed my whole career .

" <p> A particular kind of heel in pro wrestling can be absolutely loathed for years until , oddly , they 're loved . It may be an appreciation of their craft . Perhaps it 's gratefulness for still being relevant through all those angles and gimmicks . Randy Orton is one example of this phenomenon . <p> " People are saying that now , but it does n't feel like I 've done it that long , " she said . " When you think of Randy and those guys , it 's 25 or 30 years . I 'm at the 10-year mark . Maybe I just caught on really fast . " <p> Flair began her WWE journey in 2012 when she was offered a developmental contract . WWE was likely as impressed with her 5-foot-10 build as they were about her lineage . <p> She worked at a private studio as a personal trainer , although she cautions not to let the title fool you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have hired me as a trainer , " she laughed . " I was definitely good at motivation . " <p> Her clientele was " a lot of businessmen and businesswomen that just needed that hour " at the gym . But Flair said she learned plenty from interacting with them and admired many of her clients . When she told them WWE had offered her a chance to start in their developmental system and they encouraged her , it was a significant endorsement that helped send Flair on her wrestling journey . <p> In the ring , she steadily improved thanks to a " better understanding of the business " and , in particular , storytelling . " In the beginning , you 're like , ' where does this hand go ? How do I not act awkward ? ' Now I can lose myself in the moment , " she said . " It really started to click in 2019 . In the last two years , every week reveals something new . " <p> Outside the ring , she transformed her body thanks to strength training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days from Orlando to Tampa to train two days a week with John Cena 's trainer for Olympic powerlifting . <p> Her strength training today is more targeted . Flair has a goal in mind for it . <p> " I would love , love , love to do a bodybuilding competition . I 'm thinking about doing it this summer , " she said , having never done one before . " I know what goes into it from a diet standpoint and how lean you get . How do I make that work on the road ? " <p> For now , her top priority is Ripley . From a physical standpoint , they 're near equals . " Normally , you have the big guy and the little guy . With us , it 's just visually impressive . "

From Roman Reigns ' undisputed Universal championship title defense in the main event to Brock Lesnar facing the 7-foot Omos , the two-night card is filled with great matches . And I 'll be lucky enough to be there . <p> As long as I can remember , wrestling has always been part of my life . Sure , I thrived on the mats and in the Octagon , but I always had a passion for the other type of wrestling . As a kid in Louisiana , I was all-in on Mid-South Wrestling , WCW and the NWA . Watching Monday Night Raw was a weekly event in my house . My fandom is something that I 'll never let go . <p> Last year I was lucky enough to actually be part of a WWE ring as the special guest referee for Matt Riddle versus Seth Rollins , and Rollins is part of my favorite WrestleMania moment , when he cashed in his Money in the Bank contract at WrestleMania 31 . I was there . I lost my mind . <p> This weekend , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ESPN 's WrestleMania coverage . There 's so much to look forward to at this event . Here 's a look at my top-five matches on the card , and some thoughts about the others . <p> Will Cody Rhodes be the one to stop Roman Reigns at WrestleMania 39 ? WWE <p> Roman Reigns is just a next-level star . He 's good with everybody he wrestles . Since Cody Rhodes has been back as the face of the company , as the good guy that WWE needed , he 's been so good . He 's the one who feels like he has a chance because he has so much momentum . <h> Editor 's Picks <h> 7d <h> 18dMarc Raimondi <p> 1 Related <p> One thing about Reigns -- after he beat Brock , I said , " It 's over now . Nobody is going to be believable to beat him anymore . " Then Cody comes back and now it seems he might do it . <p> This run actually began with Rollins , at Hell in a Cell . Rollins is in there elevating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even when he 's injured and going to be out for an extended period of time . The vision of the torn pec and all that toughness -- it was disgusting , but it lends itself to Rhodes being a viable challenger to Roman . <p> They 've done everything right in the build for this one . I ca n't wait to see what they pull out on Friday at the go-home show to get everybody prepped for Sunday . <p> Prediction : I think Reigns keeps the belt . It seems too much of a foregone conclusion that Cody is going to win . And when you start to expect things in WWE , they always smack you upside the head . Cody needs to win clean -- but I do n't know if you can let him go over clean . If Cody wins , someone has to do something , like the Usos have to turn . He 's not going to just get pinned . I like the long reign . I was talking to Bron Breakker at NXT who told me that he wishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long title reign it would get boring , but it 's not . He 's the master of the last-second kickout . He builds the drama . You need a guy like that holding the championship . <p> The Usos defend their undisputed tag team titles against Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn at WrestleMania 39 . WWE <p> I wish this were the main event of Night 1 . It probably wo n't be , but I wish it were . <p> One of the biggest tells for me in terms of how big this match is , is that my son , little Daniel , who absolutely loves wrestling , said that when Jey Uso came back and kicked Sami , it was the greatest storyline he 'd ever seen . Now , he is only 12 , but the acting of Zayn , Owens -- Owens not wanting to become his friend again , or Jey just being gone all those weeks and their facial expressions -- they just knocked it out of the park . They should repay them with a main event on night 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out explosive . <p> Prediction : KO and Sami win . Sami 's rise is the most natural rise in stardom since Daniel Bryan . Remember that whole " YES ! " thing ? Zayn 's run is probably the biggest that I 've been since then . I kinda wish he did n't wrestle for the belt at Elimination Chamber , because it did n't feel so realistic that he could win , but those guys put on a show in Montreal and I could see why they did it . <p> Logan Paul , left , will take on Seth " Freakin " Rollins in a singles match during Night 1 at WrestleMania 39 . Alex Bierens de Haan/Getty Images <p> Seth Rollins can work with everyone . He can make anyone look good in the ring , but he wo n't have to with Logan Paul . Paul is somehow the greatest natural professional wrestler I 've ever seen in my entire life . <p> Paul said on Raw recently that " You can love me or hate me , but the fact is I 'm really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From wrestling The Miz , and then I thought he was so in over his head against Roman Reigns in his second match , but he did a really good job . <p> These two are going to make magic . Rollins has all the ability to go flying . My favorite move in all of professional wrestling is the Falcon Arrow . He told me in Philly when I was the referee for his match that he loves doing that move , but he ca n't do it every night because it 's taking . It 's such an amazing maneuver . <p> Prediction : Rollins has to win this . He is a guy who does n't have to win to stay vital to the company , but at some point he has to get some W 's . And I think he needs to get one over Logan . <p> When you put these three guys in the ring , it 's going to be a train wreck . I think that this match is going to be a barnburner . If you go back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watching him come up from NXT and become the Intercontinental champion with the sustained run he 's had and the matches he 's put on , I feel down the line in the not so distant future , he 'll be one of the best heels in WWE . <p> He 's physical , he has great endurance , a great character and I love the whole " he does n't like entertainment , he loves professional wrestling . " I love the guy that keeps the blinders on and ca n't look to see what wrestling is . How he feels the New Day and others are a disgrace because they make wrestling so silly . <p> Sheamus has been around for a long time ; McIntyre , too . You saw at Clash at the Castle , when Sheamus fought Gunther , it was so physical . They were so beaten up by the end of the match . I felt like I could watch these two wrestle each other . Actually , it looked like a fight more than a wrestling match . <p> Gunther also showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next step . <p> If I were building an opening match for WrestleMania , I would do Charlotte vs . Rhea . Charlotte is one of the most gifted female wrestlers we have seen in a really long time . I think that her move set is unique enough that it does n't get stale over time . She tends to up the ante when she gets into big moments . I still remember her and Ronda Rousey last year , and I think that was one of the best matches I saw all weekend , and that was a really good WrestleMania . <p> Rhea Ripley is just a powerhouse . The way she has built her persona is phenomenal -- and it 's believable . For me , it 's all about being believable . I want to see someone that I feel is a believable challenger to the champion . Rhea is as believable as they come . She 's big . She 's intimidating and she has a powerhouse style that will lend itself to a great match . <p> Prediction : Rhea Ripley gets it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the physical stature of Ripley -- and I loved it . <h> Other matches I 'm excited for : <p> Rey Mysterio vs . Dominik Mysterio : I want to see them wrestle . They 've held off on the setup long enough and we 're going to see a special moment in Los Angeles between the two . <p> Austin Theory vs . John Cena : It 's crazy that I left this out of my top 5 , but it 's a match I 'm really excited about . I think what they 've done with Theory since he lost the Money in the Bank briefcase has been really good . He just did n't seem like a guy who would carry a belt , and now he has the U.S. championship . He 's not John Cena Part 2 anymore ; he 's a whole other guy . Obviously Cena is one of the greatest of all time , so this one will be fun . <p> Asuka vs . Bianca Belair : Good match -- I ca n't wait for it . Bianca is on such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up against Asuka ? <p> Hell in a Cell -- Edge vs . Finn Balor : I still wonder where Finn Balor goes , because I think this Judgment Day thing is finally working . Dominik has a lot of momentum . Rhea obviously does too . I think Finn beating Edge at WrestleMania will give him the momentum that will propel him to the top of the card once again . <p> Brock Lesnar vs . Omos : This one is a head-scratcher . Brock has always been in a marquee match , but the reality of the situation is that we 're running out of time ahead of WrestleMania . There has n't been the ability to build Omos as much as you could with a 7-foot-4 guy . But his physical stature makes it believable . He could challenge Brock . <p> But could you imagine if Brock picks Omos up for an F-5 ? If he gets him up , he 's not human . His hands are big . His body is insanely big .

The organization said these questionable provisions contradict the intent of Republic Act 11534 or the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises , enacted in February 2021 . <p> CILA also assailed BIR issuances Revenue Regulations 21-2021 , and Revenue Memorandum Circular 24-2022 that were issued on December 3 , 2021 and February 23 , 2022 , respectively . <p> One example of the misapplication , as noted by Pimentel , is this : " Those registered business enterprises granted incentives prior to CREATE have a 10-year sunset clause . They are allowed to still enjoy incentives . The CREATE law IRR and RR in effect removed the VAT incentives even during transition . " <p> Pimentel is linking up with his sole ally in the minority , Sen. Risa Hontiveros , in prodding authorities to revisit this misapplication of CREATE law , expressing concern over its dire consequences on the performance of locators in ecozones like Clark and its dampening effect on investors . <p> " While we agree that the passage of CREATE has amended all the ecozone laws , particularly Sec. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we call upon the DOF to exercise prudence in the interpretation of the law in its IRR , " Marcos said in a text message to BusinessMirror . <p> " CREATE does not remove the incentive of locators for duty-free importation of capital and raw materials for the exclusive use of registered projects and activities of registered business enterprises ( RBEs ) . Removing these incentives is a clear misapplication of the CREATE law and will cause great harm to the investment climate of the country , " Marcos asserted . <p> In a Manifesto issued during the very first General Membership Meeting of CILA this year , last March 27 , the organization expressed fear of " massive opportunity costs for the Philippine economy in terms of job creation , foreign direct investments and exports . " <p> As of December 2022 , there are 1,096 foreign and local investors in Clark . Possible closure of Clark enterprises could jeopardize around 128,000 jobs .

Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo , Senators Pimentel III and Hontiveros , and former Justice Elpidio Vega , Head of the Office for Government Corporate Counsel . <p> " We continue to make an appeal for the government to cure the situation by ordering the review and amendment of the IRR and the immediate suspension of RR-21-2021 , RMC 24-2022 in order to preserve the original intent of the CREATE Act , " said CILA 's manifesto . <p> " While the CREATE Act passed by Congress , extended a sunset provision of 10 years for all registered business enterprises RBEs currently enjoying fiscal perks , the IRR that was crafted by the DOF introduced a distinction between export enterprise EE and domestic market enterprise DME and prescribed different treatments for each category .

" <p> Failure by government to immediately address this conflict with the CREATE Act may , CILA added , lead to " further erosion of the Philippines ' competitiveness in comparison to its ASEAN neighbors and other comparative economies and the exclusion of small and medium enterprises SMEs outside of the freeport zones from participating in the global value chain .

For lunch in our hometown Mangatarem , I had the best dinengdeng , courtesy of my Auntie Lily , an accomplished cook , plus grilled catfish and homemade salted duck eggs -- oily , not overly salty , exactly the way I like it . <p> My aunt sent us off with a pack of the best tupig from Patring 's , just across her house along Romulo Highway , plus luscious Pangasinan carabao mangoes , a bilao each of green pinipig biko , kulambo ( kalamay ) and the local fermented rice called binuburan . <p> Patring 's special tupig is a good example of success based on quality products .

Patring 's tupig , prepared the proper way and without scrimping on ingredients , irreversibly changed my opinion of this Pangasinan delicacy . <p> Auntie Lily 's dinengdeng was salted with local bagoong isda and had broiled milkfish or bangus from Dagupan City , where we later bought fresh , marinated and smoked bangus at the main fish market . And of course we bought three other famous Pangasinan products : patis or fish sauce , the bagoong isda and sea salt . <p> * * * <p> In the region that is the biggest producer of native onions , I was glad to note that finally , onion prices no longer make you weep . <p> During the Holy Week break , locally grown red onions and pungent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the roadside in Lingayen , Pangasinan .

The wholesalers by the main road in Lingayen told me the farm gate price was too high so they just sold the large imported varieties , which were cheaper and were being retailed at just P100 to P120 a kilo depending on the quality . <p> On the way back to Manila , we finally chanced upon a row of roadside stalls still selling the native Ilocos garlic in the traditional braids or bunches .

" After processing the situation at lightning speed , the pastor decided to go ahead with " a word " so ridiculous and comical and told the lady : " Strawberry . " <p> The woman 's eyes grew big , tears began to fall and she turned to a man nearby , brought him to the pastor and asked the pastor : " Tell him what you just told me .

The tests ultimately centered on a " huge mass " around his pancreas which is inoperable . From what I understood , due to his current condition , it is very difficult for Alex to take in food because the mass around his pancreas has compromised the functions of his stomach . <p> I let Alex do most of the talking , knowing that he needed to share his thoughts and desperation until the point when he said that he was happy that I was there to talk with him .

@@98217232 <h> Time for winter-melon soup <p> As I should have expected , last week 's Qwertyman piece on a recent visit I made to Taiwan as an ordinary tourist provoked a small firestorm from readers who berated me for my " ignorance " of the " one-China policy , " because I had described Taiwan as a " country " in my column . <p> I replied politely to these objections , explaining that ( 1 ) while I was aware that our government , among most others in the world , subscribed to the one-China policy , I was n't the government and ( 2 ) that " country " to this writer was more of a state of mind , if not of fact ( and if we have to be persnickety about fact , then consider that Wales and Scotland are accepted as countries within the United Kingdom ) . <p> One of my reactors was gracious enough to yield the point and leave me be , but another insisted that I had China all wrong -- that it had no unfriendly intentions toward the Philippines , and that its occupation of what we hold to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere enforcement of its historic rights to those territories . " Absolutely no intentions of invading the Philippines ? " Has n't that already begun ? <p> My column also prompted some reflections from an old friend and comrade in the fight against the martial law dictatorship . Commenting on China 's threats to bring Taiwan under its heel , by force if necessary , my friend remarked : " It 's hard to comprehend how the leaders of big , powerful China could feel justified in unleashing death and destruction against the people of small but proud Taiwan , a country that poses no threat , and against fellow Chinese of near identical racial and cultural origin . After all , is n't this the China that I , and many of us , not too long ago , emulated as the model for ' liberating ' our own country , and whose proletarian ideology we embraced as the formula for ushering a new and better age for humanity ? How is this a manifestation of Mao 's ringing slogan to ' Serve the People ? ' <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lofty ideals in the current behavior of Russia , the progenitor of ' egalitarian socialism , ' now immersed in a barbaric project to decimate the people of Ukraine , members of their own Slavic family . Yes , Putin does n't call himself socialist but it was this system that trained and tutored him , and whose humiliation he 's trying to undo .... However , in light of the current behaviors of Russia and China , the two foremost homes of the Marxist experiment , and in light of the incontrovertible failure of Joma Sison 's project in our country , we who dabbled in this belief system need to step back and take a good hard look . " <p> I thanked my friend for his ruminations , which I completely identify with . Indeed , as fervent if na ? ve activists in the 1970s , we looked up to Mao 's China as a beacon of socialist virtue . Today 's Red-taggers would have fulfilled their month 's quota with the likes of me . I kept Mao 's " Little Red Book " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power grows out of the barrel of a gun " and " A revolution is not a dinner party , or writing an essay , or painting a picture , or doing embroidery ; it can not be so refined , so leisurely and gentle , so temperate , kind , courteous , restrained and magnanimous . A revolution is an insurrection , an act of violence by which one class overthrows another . " <p> On my first visit to China in 1987 , our guide was surprised that I could sing " Sailing the Seas Depends Upon the Helmsman " and that I wanted to visit Mao 's tomb . " What do you want to visit him for ? " our guide asked in consternation . " He killed my father during the Cultural Revolution ! " <p> In various capacities as a tourist , a journalist , a writer and academic , I have visited China many times since that first encounter , and have seen how its people -- honest , hardworking , hopeful people like us -- have managed to survive and prosper under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed how the government was intent on modernizing its economic and physical landscape , razing down whole rows of hutongs or old communities in cities to make way for swanky new high-rises . On one visit to Shanghai , I could n't resist noting the irony of how the historic site of first National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party -- a sacred shrine of that ideology -- was located in the heart of what has become one of the city 's glitziest and most upscale districts , Xintiandi , in close proximity to a posh French restaurant . <p> I do n't think anyone can fault China for its transformation into an economic powerhouse , or even deny that its strong central planning was a key factor in making that happen , especially under Deng Xiaoping . What I 'm sad about ( and this statement will probably cost me my next Chinese visa , but no matter ) is how this China has remained a tyrant to its own people and a bully to its neighbors -- something that it does n't need to be , except to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it wants to , it could yet become an example of a confident and benign socialism -- something the CCP will never dare to embrace , for fear of seeming soft , especially in the face of American , Japanese , Korean , and yes , Taiwanese resistance . I ca n't help thinking that while there may be " one China " in whatever configuration the politicians propose , there are indeed two Chinas in our hearts -- the one we have been historically and culturally enmeshed with and want to love , and the other that wo n't rest until we kowtow to its might . <p> And before the pro-Beijing troll machine springs into action , let me say this again : I separate governments and regimes from the people they theoretically represent and should be serving . ( We also have to be reminded that there are significant political factions in both Beijing and Taipei , and that Chiang Kai-shek 's Kuomintang were no angels when they " liberated " Formosa from the Japanese , only to take it over . ) <p> I have written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both China and Taiwan without any sponsorship from either entity 's government . There are powerful lobbies for both sides right here in this country -- one even offered to send me on an " observation tour , " which I gently declined , aware of the political subtext ; I would go , I said , on my own dime , and I did . ( Which is not to say I will refuse " observation tours " of the south of France , Tahiti , the Nordic fjords , the Patagonian forests and other bucket-list destinations not likely to invade the Philippines . ) <p> To Beijing 's and Taipei 's cheerleaders , chill out and enjoy the scenery ; some calming winter-melon soup might help to keep the vitriol down . <p> This was supposedly part of the LTO 's gender and development program , but Bahaghari warned this could be harmful to the LGTBQ+ community considering the prejudices they already face , such as some wrongfully claiming that they have a disorder or physical incapacity. 
@@98217233 <h> ' Comelec Integrity Bill ' <p> Like hundreds of other legislative measures filed for enactment , there is one landmark proposed law called as " Integrity Bill " that has failed to muster votes of our lawmakers in two Congresses past . The proposed " Integrity Bill " specifically refers to the Commission on Elections ( Comelec ) . The seven-man poll body , chaired by veteran election lawyer George Garcia , included the proposed " Comelec Integrity Act " among the recommendations reached during the National Election Summit held last March 8 to 10 . <p> The proposed law seeks to strengthen the Comelec by providing office spaces separate and independent from local government units ( LGUs ) and appropriating funds from the annual budget of the national government . Specifically , this will amend the provision of the Omnibus Election Code which only allows the LGUs , not the poll body , to provide office space for their respective local Comelec . <p> The Comelec is the only constitutional body that does not have its own building . <p> That is according to Comelec official spokesman John Rex Laudiangco . But sooner than later this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edifice complex . Laudiangco announced in our Kapihan sa Manila Bay last week that the Department of Budget and Management ( DBM ) has given the green light for the P8.9-billion project to construct the Comelec complex . Laudiangco hailed the DBM for approving last March 29 their long pending request for the Multi-Year Contractual Authority ( MYCA ) . <p> With funding secured , he stressed , this would enable them to start the bidding process for the construction of the new Comelec head office and two multi-purpose buildings for the more than 2,000 officials and personnel of the poll body in the National Capital Region ( NCR ) . It will rise at the Central Business Park 1 Island A in the Mall of Asia ( MOA ) Complex at the Manila Bay reclamation area in Pasay City . The Comelec acquired the three-hectare land property for P1 billion in 2013 from the Public Estates Authority and the Philippine Reclamation Authority . <p> " The Comelec will finally realize our dream of having a permanent home in 83 years of existence , " Laudiangco raved . <p> Based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head office would be built over the next two to three years . The two adjoining multi-purpose buildings are slated for completion in four to five years . The Comelec complex will put together under one roof all their offices scattered around Metro Manila . <p> Once completed , he disclosed , the canvassing of the next presidential and national elections by May 2028 can be conducted within the specially built function halls of the soon to rise Comelec complex . This means , he added , the national canvassing will no longer be done at the Philippine International Convention Center along Roxas Boulevard in Pasay City . <p> The Comelec is currently leasing three floors of the seven-storey Palacio del Gobernador in Intramuros , Manila . The Palacio is owned by the Office of the President . The other Comelec offices are renting spaces in the Shipping Center Bldg. at Andres Soriano St. , and in the Red Cross Bldg. in Gen. Antonio Luna St. , all located in Intramuros as well as the Comelec NCR office at P1 Bldg. at Bgy . Greenhills in San Juan City . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crosses the street at least five to ten times a day from the Comelec spokesman 's office at the Shipping Center Bldg. to attend meetings at the Palacio located across from his place of work . <p> The Comelec has been renting also warehouse spaces for the repository of its ballot boxes , vote counting machines ( VCMs ) , and other election-related equipment in Sta . Rosa , Laguna ; Sta . Mesa , Manila ; and in Mindanao Avenue in Quezon City . Laudiangco justified the urgency of the passage into law of the " Comelec Integrity Act " that would enable the government to save around P169 million in the annual budget for office space rental payments . <p> The building complex is the seeming lynchpin of the proposed " Comelec Integrity Act " that they are asking the present 19th Congress to pass into law , at least before the holding of the next elections in our country by May 2025 . Laudiangco disclosed the proposed " Comelec Integrity Act " is among the wish list of legislative measures they submitted to President Ferdinand " Bongbong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the three-day summit . <p> However , the proposed " Comelec Integrity Act " is not mentioned among the administration 's priority bills and neither in the common legislative agenda of the Legislative-Executive Development Advisory Council ( LEDAC ) . The proposed bill has been re-filed on Oct.12 last year under Senate Bill 1384 authored by Senator Ramon " Bong " Revilla Jr . <p> According to Laudiangco , the Comelec has been actively engaged with the Technical Working Group ( TWG ) in both chambers of the 19th Congress that have been handling bills on electoral reforms pending in various stages of the legislative mills . Currently enjoying their one-month recess , our lawmakers will resume sessions on May 8 this year . <p> The Senate and the Lower House will adjourn sine die their first regular sessions in June 2 this year . They will start the second regular sessions on July 24 . By then , PBBM will deliver his next state of the nation address to spell out his new legislative priorities . <p> " At the summit , President Marcos mentioned to chairman Garcia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Laudiangco recalled . <p> Laudiangco believes the passage into law of the proposed " Comelec Integrity Act " would provide the " milestone of independence " of the poll body . If approved into law , he explained , this would protect them from the undue pressure , interference , and other unscrupulous antics by politicians trying to gain leverage , most especially from the local poll officers of the Comelec . <p> But counting on the proposed " Comelec Integrity Act " is not the be-all or the end-all to cure the various gaps and loopholes in the Omnibus Election Code and other existing election laws in the Philippines . <p> This was supposedly part of the LTO 's gender and development program , but Bahaghari warned this could be harmful to the LGTBQ+ community considering the prejudices they already face , such as some wrongfully claiming that they have a disorder or physical incapacity.

I think they 're in the period of interpellation right now , and will probably take up amendments and approval next week , at the earliest , " Salceda said at the weekend . This follows last week 's lengthy interpellations of the chief sponsor , Senate Banking committee chairman Mark A.

Taxes are a good way to recover investments into the fund . " <p> " That also addresses certain " neutrality " rules in other countries . Some developed countries like Australia tend to avoid dealing with corporations with special state privileges because of what 's called ' government neutrality ' requirements .

And believe it or not , it 's not the most pleasant way to travel . I know because I 've tried it many times . <p> Traveling by boat can be as third world as it can be -- crowded beyond capacity , no seats , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can go on and on . <p> It 's good that our lawmakers are looking into what 's happening so that airline passengers would understand what 's happening . <h> New aircraft <p> CEB , in response , has taken serious note of all the issues raised regarding its operations and customer handling . <p> It has committed to immediately address all the concerns even as it manages the operational challenges it faces borne out of global aircraft and supply chain issues . <p> It has taken delivery of an Airbus A320 aircraft last June 23 and another one on Friday to reinforce network stability . <h> Overbooking <p> On the issue of overbooking , CEB clarified that it is not doing overbooking at all during peak travel periods . <p> While overbooking is an accepted global industry practice , taking into account possible no-shows , CEB said its policy is to overbook only up to an average of four percent and does not allow overbooking at all during peak travel periods . <p> From 2020 to May 2023 , CEB carried close to 30 million passengers . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ratio of 0.03 per 100,000 passengers carried . <p> " This year , we have had no denied boarding due to overbooking , " CEB said in its response to the Senate inquiry . <p> I personally hope overbooking wo n't be allowed anymore . <p> The reason why passengers were n't able to board their flights is aircraft downgrades . Some aircraft were n't available because of maintenance issues caused by supply chain problems involving aircraft parts . <p> Thus , when passengers booked a flight months before their trip , the aircraft that was previously scheduled to service that flight was no longer available by the time of the actual trip due to maintenance issues . <p> Instead of cancelling the flight -- which would mean more passengers wo n't be able to travel -- CEB opted to use an available standby smaller aircraft . <p> The displaced passengers are re-accommodated to the next available flight and are given the options to rebook or refund without charges . <p> A Manila to Cebu flight , for example , was originally assigned an A321NEO with 236 seats but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used . Rather than cancelling it outright , if there was an A320 available with 180 seats , the flight would push through , which would inevitably displace passengers . <p> CEB 's mistake was not explaining this well to confused passengers until the whole thing got so messed up , plus the fact that it did n't reduce its number of flights early on . The way I see it , it 's an unfortunate situation that is plaguing other carriers too . The pandemic affected the global supply chain -- from potatoes to wheat to cheese and now , airplane parts . <p> It 's hard for any passenger suddenly unable to board a flight to understand this but it is what it is . <p> Moving forward , CEB has committed to reduce its flights , given the unprecedented number of grounded aircraft , some of which may be out of service for a considerable amount of time .

Even France , in a visit of President Macron to China to drum up more Chinese trade , stated that the China threat should not be relevant to Europe . This was purely a self-serving statement because Macron stated that the Russian invasion of Ukraine was a global threat , and at the same time Chinese abuses were not a concern of Europe . <p> For example , the Chinese Communist Party has been guilty of human rights abuses and even genocide on the Muslim minority in Xinjiang province of China .

In 2010 , after a Norwegian committee awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to a Chinese dissident , Beijing heavily restricted imports of Norwegian salmon . In 2016 , after South Korea agreed to host a US missile system , Beijing forced the Korea-based Lotte group to close down its stores in China . It also restricted the sale of group tours to South Korea of Chinese travelers . <p> In 2012 , Toyota 's manufacturing plants in China were shut down by Chinese " protesters " due to tensions between the two countries over the Senkaku Islands , which are administered by Tokyo but are claimed by Beijing .

When we moved to China 's capital from Cantonese and English speaking Hong Kong , we only spoke two basic words , ni hao and xie xie . Our first two weeks in the city was a struggle in comical proportions . When taking taxis pre-smart phone days , my mother devised a clever way of giving directions redolent of an arts and crafts class . She made a cutout collection of plastic bags with the logos of groceries and malls we frequented which we showed to the driver before the start of every trip . That ingenious idea amused most cab drivers who , without question , would drive us safely to our destination . <p> Dining in a restaurant that same summer week , we requested for ice cubes since hot tea or warm water is customarily served regardless of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feel frustrated and very thirsty . My mother kept her cool and called the waiter again .

Charmed but not perplexed the waiter nodded repeatedly , quickly left then returned in a jiffy with a bucket of ice , cheerfully saying , " b ? ng " -- ice in Mandarin ! While my mother saved the day , I decided it was time to say goodbye to the cutouts and pantomimes and start to learn Mandarin . <p> Learning a new language is the key that unlocks our sense of wonder as we start to live in and explore a new adoptive country . For itinerants like us , it is a must-do in order for us to appreciate the novelties and adapt to the culture that we are gradually immersing into . It is a unifying medium that deeply connects us with the people , especially those we interact with on a daily basis such as neighbors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only of our daily survival but of our life as strangers in a country not our own . <p> Our kids learned Mandarin from school and playmates while I took a three-month course in a language school . But my most enriching lessons took place in the markets or shopping areas , especially when asking details about an item , while haggling , when conversing with neighbors , chatting with drivers and interactions with my students , who were learning English as a second language from me . These exchanges were not without mishaps though and countless lost in translation episodes . <p> Mandarin as a language is tonal . A word that is wrongly enunciated can mean otherwise . For example sugar and soup are both " tang . " In a fast food I once asked for sugar and said t ? ng ( the wrong tone ) so the staff handed me a bowl of soup . This happened a few times so I eventually realized that when I needed t ? ng ( sugar ) it was best to say it while pointing to my drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one winter .

Our friend was very impressed at how " fluent " I was with the language . Little did he know that I had memorized those lines many times over , they being perhaps our 10th visitor in Beijing . As in any language learning , the secret is in the drill . <p> Learning Bahasa Indonesia was a breeze because of its over 3,000 shared vocabulary with Filipino and our regional dialects . Yet when we spoke Bahasa Indonesia with the locals they still asked us the same curious question : " Where are you from ?

Yet sans the language barrier it is easy to navigate the city , run errands , visit museums and places of interests or to simply spark a conversation . On one hand , I am equally awed at the distinct tongues and accents I hear in this socio-culturally diverse city . So when I talk I make sure my words or gestures are within culturally accepted norms and oftentimes I try to adjust my tone and cadence in order to be clearly understood . For example , when ordering " take out " food as we say back home , I make sure I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away " or bungkus as we used to say in Indonesia . <p> In her book " Individual Differences in Language Acquisition , " Muriel Saville-Troike said that we apply " pragmatic skills and communication strategies " while learning a new language . This I thought were the tactics my mother used in our early days in Beijing . The linguist-professor also mentioned about " intonation and stress , rhythmic patterns and choice of words and pronunciation " as factors in language learning , which thankfully I find extremely handy when communicating in multi-ethnic New York .

After being cooped up at home because of the pandemic , travelers now want to experience " authentic experiences " and adventures their friends back home have not yet tried , the agencies said . ( And so what ? They are averse to " fun " ? ) <p> According to Marie Adriano , group strategic head of DDB , " Diving into social listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Love ' is the positive theme they associate with our country . Frequently mentioned in high volume globally . The Philippine mentions are even double than that of the US . While fun remains a positive theme and certainly part of the Pinoy DNA , there is less volume of mentions . " <p> While she does n't cite the source of this survey , let 's just say it 's true . But these are tourists , who have already visited the country and experienced its pleasures . We 're not trying to attract them again -- because with or without a slogan , they will return if they enjoyed their time here . We 're supposed to attract the new travelers , the " changed traveler , " the tourists who have yet to visit , or has n't even heard of us beyond the few mentions in TV shows and movies . We need a tourism slogan that would grab their attention , engage them , make them act on impulse and start booking trips here , while seated at their computers . <p> Tourist : So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Because , Love the Philippines ! <p> It does n't make sense . <p> Second District Albay Rep. Joey Salceda , who is one of the most hard-working promoters of his province and has joined tourism selling missions abroad , uses statistics to prove the power of " It 's More Fun in the Philippines . " From 2012 to 2019 , while the " fun " slogan was being used , the compounded annual growth rate ( CAGR ) of international arrivals in the Philippines was 8.6 percent . And this was despite of Super Typhoon Yolanda , diplomatic issues with Taiwan , the hostage-taking of Hong Kong tourists , Tanim-Bala , along with infrastructure and arrival challenges in the country . <p> The fact is , you can not argue with success . So much so that President Duterte did n't ask for the " fun " slogan to be changed . ( Jimenez 's brilliance cut across political fences that even former Finance Secretary Sonny Dominguez told me they wanted to retain him at the DOT . ) I would imagine that President Marcos Jr . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't needled to change it . As one high-ranking government official told me recently , " The President is too busy with larger problems ; I do n't think he would have minded if ' It 's more fun ' was retained , like Duterte . " I think so , too . <p> I remember when the " fun " slogan was launched in 2012 , the public took to it immediately . Memes soon popped up all over social media . It captivated the imagination and creativity of the nation that they could n't help but join the " fun . " That is what 's lacking in the " love " slogan . It does n't have the same drive and energy as " fun . " Love does n't make us stand out as a people , as a nation . Because there is also love in Barbados , and love in Cyprus , and , yes , love in New York . Love just is n't a unique proposition in a tourism campaign , and understandably the people have not taken to it . Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iconic tourist sites abroad and stamping it with the " love " slogan . <p> The " Love the Philippines " slogan has become a joke . And for that reason alone , DOT just needs to drop it .

Hey , I should spend more time on Filipino music . But then , they did make great tunes back in those days . They did influence the generations who came after . Most of all , those songs produced some of the greatest vocalists of all time . <p> One of them was Tony Bennett . He was born Antonio Bennedetto in Queens , New York on Aug. 3 , 1926 to an Italian immigrant family . He started singing when he was only five years old . This continued throughout his growing up years , not just because he really loved performing but also because he wanted to help his impoverished family . Drafted into service in World War II when he was 18 , he divided his time between raiding enemy occupied towns as an infantry rifleman and singing with the army band . <p> That he was a great talent was instantly recognizable to many he met and some of them gave him the breaks he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him her opening act ; Bob Hope who hired him and who Americanized his name to Tony Bennett ; and Mitch Miller who signed him to a recording contract . It was for Miller that he recorded his first single and first hit song , Boulevard of Broken Dreams , in 1950 . That was the start of a recording career that would last for over 70 years . <p> Bennett was a great singer with a voice of such warmth , incredible elegance , perfect tones , impeccable phrasing and a unique timeless quality . He brought all these to every song he recorded . That first year he also came out with such monster hits as Because of You , Cold Cold Heart , Rags to Riches and one of the first songs I remember liking a lot as a kid because it had candy store in the title , From the Candy Store on the Corner to the Chapel on the Hill . <p> The years passed .

It is still a fact that hits are just hits , unexplainable successes brought about by a combination of luck and the right timing . What cemented Bennett 's status as a legend was his take on the great American songbook . <p> ( Allow me an aside please , the word is rightly descriptive but it feels like I can not write American Songbook with putting in great . ) <p> Back to Bennett . He recorded so many of them , works by George Gershwin , Irving Berlin Cole Porter , Rodgers and Hart and many others .

The collaboration resulted not only in a No. 1 seller a few Grammys and some Emmy Nominations . Bennett 's final public performance was with Lady Gaga in August 2021 . <p> Love for Sale was Bennett 's 61st and final recorded album . He was 95 years old at the time .

Minimalism has become a lifestyle trend with people wanting less stuff at home and living with just the most basic of things -- a few clothes , a few shoes and everything downsized in quantity . <p> After the pandemic , though we are still extra careful and still wear masks in enclosed spaces , I checked our pantry which was stocked with food items that may , just in case , come in handy should there be another lockdown . It is now time to share these goods and feed others while you clean up your house . <p> A neat freak of a friend shared this technique with me .

They keep everything in many tied up bags that are unlabelled . They just want to keep stuff . Sometimes , it is handy to have this kind of friend when you need a paper clip , a rubber band or anything useful but is not in your daily list of staples . <p> But minimalist trendsetters have written books on decluttering and living with less . They say it is healthier for the mind when you see less mess as the environment you move in is a reflection of your state of mind . Or put another way , a cluttered place makes it difficult to think clearly .

@@100504235 <h> UNGA Resolution <p> The idea of China being brought to its knees -- for repeatedly transgressing the rights and freedoms of the Philippines and flouting the United Nations Convention on the Laws of the Sea ( UNCLOS ) -- by a UN body might particularly excite our fisherfolk and military personnel who navigate the troubled West Philippine Sea ( WPS ) daily . In 2023 alone , the country filed 30 diplomatic protests over China 's presence in the maritime zone . Ergo , will an intervention from the UN General Assembly ( UNGA ) , as proposed by the Senate to the executive department , finally force the Asian hegemon to stop its illegal activities in WPS ? <p> President Marcos , in his recent State of the Nation Address , vowed to continue to defend our sovereign rights and territorial integrity . His pronouncement coincides with the 7th anniversary of the country 's landmark arbitration victory against China . The latter has ignored it to this day . <p> International jurisprudence <p> Notably , The Hague Tribunal found that China violated our sovereign rights concerning our exclusive economic zone ( EZZ ) and continental shelf . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed to prevent Chinese fishermen from fishing in the zone . It also constructed artificial islands in seven features of the Spratly Islands , two of which fall within our EZZ and another within our territorial sea . These large-scale reclamation activities damaged the marine environment and fragile ecosystems . China also did not stop Chinese fishermen from harvesting endangered species in the zone . <p> The Tribunal also refuted China 's historic rights to resources and other pre-existing entitlements through its so-called Nine-Dash Line . When the UNCLOS entered into force in 1994 , these historic rights were extinguished and therefore contravened the Convention 's detailed allocation of rights and maritime zones . <p> Clearly , the Tribunal resolved issues between the two countries related to the UNCLOS , such as EEZ , territorial sea and internal waters . Let me point out that the Tribunal did not decide on the maritime features of the Spratly Archipelago , which are claimed by the Philippines , China and four other countries . The issue does not fall within the ambit of the Convention . It is covered by Public International @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to international law through treaties , customs and interpretations by their own domestic judiciaries and international tribunals ( Library of Congress ) . The International Court of Justice ( ICJ ) , the UN 's principal judicial organ that settles disputes between states , or an arbitration court will determine which claimant country has the strongest evidence of sovereignty over the disputed islands . <p> Regardless of China 's protestations , the Tribunal 's decision has become evidence or a source of international law . Under Article 38 of the ICJ Statute , the Court shall apply international conventions , international custom , general principles of law recognized by civilized nations and judicial decisions and teachings of the most highly qualified publicists of various nations . <p> As a state party to the UNCLOS , China must comply with the Tribunal 's ruling that has a binding force on all parties to the dispute ( Article 296 ) . Technically , China 's refusal to participate in the arbitration proceedings meant it can no longer file an appeal ( Article 11 of Annex VII ) . Even if China imposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result in a sovereign title to the disputed features of the Spratly Islands . Under the UN Charter , a sovereign title can not be acquired purely by the use of unilateral force ( Philippine Legal Research ) . <p> Non-binding nature <p> China 's belligerent action in the WPS continues to escalate , prompting the Senate to ask the Marcos administration to sponsor a resolution before the UNGA . The end goal is to compel the country to accept and follow the 2016 Arbitral Ruling . <p> Getting the tacit support of the community of nations to stop China 's incursion into our territory is welcome . China deserves international condemnation for its relentless bullying of our compatriots , who are exercising their traditional fishing rights or are enforcing our maritime laws in the WPS . Elevating the issue before the UN , however , might not be the correct course of action . <p> By its admission , the international body said its resolutions are non-binding . These formal expressions of opinion under the UN system do not carry legal effect or weight . They are , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the General Assembly may discuss matters or make recommendations to member-nations or the Security Council .

Likewise , the Council 's permanent members -- China , France , Russia , the United Kingdom , and the United States -- must unanimously approve all resolutions . <p> The only way for the General Assembly to universally implement its decisions is through consensus-building . According to the UN , the best way to encourage all member-states is to get all of them to agree on the same text . Those that did not vote in favor of a particular agenda item in the resolution will be less likely to enforce the said agenda item . In adopting a resolution by consensus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into consideration . <p> Going back to my earlier question , can we muster overwhelming support for the Philippine resolution against China ? I think not . <p> The UN has 193 members at present . These countries , including China , must agree on every agenda item in the Philippine resolution . Otherwise , there will be no consensus . And because China is a Council member , the resolution will definitely face rough-sailing in the General Assembly . We must also consider the fact that 151 countries have joined or benefitted from the Belt and Road Initiative ( BRI ) . I reckon most of these BRI country-partners might not go against China if the GA adopts the Philippine resolution through a vote or by consensus . Thus , I agree with Senator Allan Cayetano 's suggestion that the Senate hold a caucus to further thresh out the issue . <p> An autopsy report on the slain peasant organizer and NDFP consultant Ericson Acosta was presented Saturday , fueling more questions whether or not an encounter between him and the military happened before his death .

Rosa <p> One year of the Marcos administration has passed , and people have been waiting for the administration 's next steps that would demonstrate a stronger anti-corruption position . <p> During the State of the Nation Address , the president announced that he was against corruption . But what people want to know is that beyond the rhetoric , what concrete policy is there ? What can we expect ? <p> A Pulse Asia survey conducted in June showed the need to fight graft and corruption in government came in fifth on a list of what people identified as their most urgent national concerns . Controlling inflation and increasing the pay of workers topped the list , naturally because these affect Filipinos ' day-to-day quality of life . But after these basic concerns are met , mitigating public sector corruption is the next concern of the people . <p> Seeing the SONA in light of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , President Marcos has made his stance against corruption clear -- that it will not be tolerated in government , and that digitalization , one of his administration 's largest reforms , will tackle corruption by fostering transparency and accountability . <p> I agree with the president to a great extent , and the most recent Pulse Asia survey supports this as well . One question in the survey asks respondents to show how they are most affected by corruption . Here 's the interesting bit : rather than picking an economic effect such as losing money due to bribes or lessened public funds overall , respondents showed that the top two greatest effects were a loss of trust in government services and public officials , and a normalized attitude towards corrupt activity . <p> This tells us that the greatest consequence of corruption is brought about by the everyday experiences of people dealing with corrupt activity , such that they have become desensitized to it . <p> Corruption also greatly erodes trust in the public sector . When people constantly experience extortion or the need to bribe to facilitate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They continue to conduct their affairs through corrupt means even though there are legitimate ways of doing so . <p> Indeed , digitalization efforts can be a game-changer in eradicating person-to-person interactions , thereby greatly limiting opportunities for petty corruption like bribes . Digitizing government services can restore trust in the government and remind us that corruption is neither good nor beneficial , no matter how widespread it has become . <p> Here , however , is where my apprehension about the president 's focus comes in . While everything may go according to plan and everyday-level corruption is kept in check , this takes the focus away from other types of corruption such as large-scale corruption in higher places in government , or what we call grand corruption . <p> Filipinos are no strangers to allegations of grand corruption , from large-scale agricultural smuggling enabled by officials in the Department of Agriculture , to corruption in the health sector such as the missing PhilHealth funds that remain a mystery until today . <p> Even as the public continue to build trust in public service delivery through digitalization , these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevalent . They will continue to undermine public trust . The President said he would accept the resignation of people involved in drug trade allegations . This is a token gesture at best because the root causes remain unaddressed . <p> Corruption should be addressed in all government sectors . This begins with a comprehensive anti-corruption framework where each sector becomes responsible for identifying and mitigating corrupt activity , rather than entrusting whole processes to a few key bodies like the Commission on Audit , the Office of the Ombudsman , the Anti-Red Tape Authority and the like . <p> This last point is supplemented by public opinion in the last Pulse Asia survey where 84% of Filipinos believe that the government should continually strengthen laws , existing mechanisms , and agencies to continue combatting corruption . <p> Other whole-of-society approaches include adding anti-corruption education to the curriculum for more longitudinal outcomes , passing the Freedom of Information Act for greater transparency , and in the long run , creating a truly independent Anti-Corruption Commission . <p> These are ideal policy directions for the government . Judging from the direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years however , a whole-of-society approach against fighting corruption does not seem to be a priority . <p> Still , any effort towards mitigating corruption is always welcome , and digitalization is a good first step . Filipinos hope that as the president continues to push for greater transparency in government service delivery and systems , the rest of Congress will follow suit . <p> Filipinos shouled be vigilant and vocal as thet assess whether these anti-corruption efforts are realistic , or just for show . <p> Mashan Bernice " Shanice " Espiritu is the policy and regulatory manager of think tank Stratbase and co-convenor of Democracy Watch , Philippines .

San Diego noted that a significant reduction in chicken importation should be imposed . <p> In a related development , the Management Association of the Philippines ( MAP ) recently called on the government to move toward achieving a comprehensive tariff structure . MAP listed the products that it wants to be reviewed for reduction including sugar , meat , fish , rice , and corn . <p> Monetary Board member , economist , and agriculture expert Bruce Tolentino maintains that .

Subsequently , this will deter reliance on corn alternative ( e.g. feed wheat for feed milling , feedstock for bioethanol ) and raise the overall demand for corn in the Philippines .

The faster inflation would also trim Filipinos ' savings in general , he added . <p> " Still , the reality in the Philippines is that we have a low-insurance penetration rate so there is really room for us to grow . It is a matter of increasing Filipinos ' financial literacy , " he said . <p> " For me , the more pressing need is to protect savings .

@@102859235 <h> Refund : Substantiation of unutilized input VAT no more <p> For many years now , the right of taxpayers to claim for value added tax refund has been constrained and limited . The Court of Tax Appeals ( CTA ) has been consistent with its stand that in a claim for refund , before the unutilized input VAT of prior quarters can be applied to the current quarter 's output tax , the same must first be substantiated . It means that a taxpayer must show the invoices or receipts from which the unutilized input VAT of the previous quarters was derived . Otherwise , only the substantiated input VAT of the current quarter may be applied to the output VAT of the current quarter . Only the remaining amount of input VAT may be refunded by a taxpayer . In effect , the refundable amount is significantly reduced . <p> The prevailing ruling for many years is that if a taxpayer does not have an excess input VAT over its output VAT in the current period , it can no longer claim for refund . Though it is common practice to charge first all the input VAT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VAT , there is no law nor regulation prohibiting the segregation of input VAT for refund from those that will be credited to output VAT during the period . <p> Many taxpayers have adopted this conservative approach . VAT refund claims have been limited to what remains with the input VAT of the current quarter after subtracting the current quarter 's output VAT . The requirement of substantiating the accumulated unutilized input tax from prior quarters is next to impossible to comply with because taxpayers are effectively being asked to prove all their input VAT since the incorporation of a company . <p> But just recently , the Supreme Court En Banc has reversed the CTA in the case of Chevron Holdings , Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue ( GR 215159 , July 5 , 2022 ) . The SC En Banc held that it would not deny the request for refund of unutilized input VAT from zero-rated sales on the ground that the taxpayer does not have " excess " input VAT from the output VAT of the quarter of claim since the law does not require it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erred in requiring the taxpayer to substantiate its excess input tax carried over from the previous quarter before it may be utilized . The SC ruled that the Tax Code merely requires that the input tax claimed for refund " has not been applied against the output tax . " <p> According to the SC , " there is nothing in the law and rules that mandate the taxpayer to deduct the input tax attributable to zero-rated sales from the output tax from regular 12 percent VAT-able sales first and only the ' excess ' may be refunded or issued a tax credit certificate . The SC added that remedies accorded by law to the taxpayer are alternatives . Requiring taxpayers to prove that they did not charge the input tax claimed for refund against the output tax is one thing ; requiring them to prove that they have ' excess ' input tax after offsetting it from output tax is another . " <p> The SC emphasized that " the crediting of input taxes , including input tax attributable to zero-rated sales , from the output tax should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more interested in reducing its output tax payable . Also , to require entities engaged in zero-rated transactions to charge their input tax from zero-rated sales against their output VAT from regular 12 percent VAT-able sales would defeat the very object of the tax measure , which is to generate more income for the government . " <p> In sum , it was erroneous for the CTA to charge the validated and substantiated input taxes against the taxpayer 's output taxes first and use the resultant amount as the basis for computing the allowable amount for refund . The CTA , according to the SC , also erred in requiring the taxpayer to substantiate its excess input tax carried over from the previous quarter as it is not a requirement for entitlement to a refund of unused or unutilized input VAT from zero-rated sales . <p> With this SC decision , taxpayers can now fully claim the input VAT of the current quarter that is attributable to its zero-rated sales .

Wilhilm Hilario ( GR 195792 , November 24 , 2014 ) when the employer unjustifiably failed to deploy the seafarer in accordance with the POEA-approved contract of employment . <p> The foreign principal had already chosen the seafarer from among the other candidates as bosun . The manning agency then entered into an employment contract and hired the seafarer . Subsequent communications , though , show that the foreign principal approved a different candidate for the position of bosun . <p> The case revolved on the issue of whether such breach would entitle the seafarer to the payment of actual damages for the failure of the employer to comply with the latter 's obligations in accordance with the employment contract . <p> The manning agency argued that the seafarer 's non-deployment was due to the foreign principal 's management prerogative to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of management prerogative is a valid and justifiable reason that would negate any liability for damages . <p> The Supreme Court , however , noted that there was a violation of the contract at the time that the foreign principal decided to promote another person . <p> The vacancy for the position of bosun ceased to exist upon the execution of the contract between the employer and seafarer that was subsequently approved by the POEA . There was no longer a vacancy when the foreign principal changed its mind , since the position of bosun had already been filled up by the seafarer . <p> The contract was already perfected on the date of its execution , which occurred when the employer and seafarer agreed on the object and the cause , as well as on the rest of the terms and conditions therein . <p> Contemporaneous with the perfection of the employment contract was the birth of certain rights and obligations , a breach of which may give rise to a cause of action against the erring party . <p> The POEA contract must also be recognized and respected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent a seafarer from being deployed without a valid reason . <p> The promotion and choice of personnel is indeed an exercise of management prerogative so long as they are exercised in good faith for the advancement of the employer 's interest , and not for the purpose of defeating or circumventing the rights of the employees under special laws or under valid agreements . <p> However , there are limitations on the exercise of management prerogatives , such as existing laws and the principle of equity and substantial justice . <p> Under the principle of equity and substantial justice , the Supreme Court underscored that change of mind is not a valid reason for the non-deployment of the seafarer . <p> He lost the opportunity to apply for other positions in other agencies when he signed the contract of employment with the employer . Simply put , that contract was binding on the parties and may not later be disowned simply because of a change of mind of either one of them . <p> The unilateral and unreasonable failure to deploy the seafarer constitutes breach of contract , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The sanctions provided for non-deployment do not end with the suspension or cancellation of license or the imposition of a fine and the return of all documents at no cost to the worker .

But the two newly discovered species need further study . <p> Significant discovery <p> Cabras said that from the point of view of taxonomy , or the classification of organisms , systematics and evolutionary history , the discovery of the two new weevil species is significant because it points out the gaps in taxonomic knowledge for weevil studies in the country . <p> " A lot of species remain undescribed from places which have been underexplored for its weevil fauna , including Leyte , " she said . <p> Weevils are generally plant feeders .

But local laws , recognizing only heterosexual marriages , forced the couple to travel to the British Embassy in Vietnam to get married in August . Their inability to marry in the city where their love story unfolded left her frustrated . <p> This weekend the drama teacher along with diverse teams of male , female and transgender players will take to the pitch with what she calls " a big purpose . " She hopes participation in the games can show the government the city 's strong support for equal rights for same-sex couples . <p> " We 're playing to possibly change laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday , the first Gay Games in Asia are fostering hopes for wider LGBTQ+ inclusion in the regional financial hub , following recent court wins in favor of equality for same-sex couples and transgender people . <p> After a year 's delay due to the pandemic , the nine-day event will host about 2,400 participants from some 40 territories . They will compete in a range of games , from tennis and swimming to culturally rich activities like dragon boat racing and mahjong . <p> Lisa Lam , co-chair of the Gay Games , said LGBTQ+ acceptance in Asia is still lower than in the rest of the world and that it 's important to make sexual minorities visible in the community . <p> " Biases come from misunderstanding or stereotypes , " Lam said . " Bringing different people together , you are able to break down stereotypes .

As Hong Kong grappled with the uncertainty of when stringent quarantine rules for travelers would be eased , Guadalajara in Mexico was named as a co-host for the games . <p> With a closer option available , many individuals from Europe and America opted not to undertake the lengthy journey to Hong Kong , Lam said . The high costs associated with long-haul flights and hotel accommodations in the post-pandemic era also deterred many potential visitors , she added . <p> Others are hesitant to visit due to the risks posed by a Beijing-imposed national security law that has jailed and silenced many activists following 2019 pro-democracy protests .

It can take time for people to fully realize the legacy of an event , said the co-founder of non-governmental organization Hong Kong Marriage Equality . <p> LGBTQ+ activism is a rare spot that is still making considerable progress in Hong Kong under a government crackdown on its civil society . <p> Over the past year , the city 's courts have ruled that full sex reassignment surgery should not be a prerequisite for transgender people to have their gender changed on their official identity cards and backed the granting of equal housing and inheritance rights for same-sex couples married overseas . Hong Kong is now moving toward a framework for recognizing same-sex partnerships following a landmark ruling in September . All these wins were brought by legal challenges launched by members of the LGBTQ+ community amid growing social acceptance of same-sex marriage . <p> Suen Yiu-tung , a gender studies professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong , acknowledged the positive progress but said Hong Kong 's LGBTQ+ development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suen pointed out that discrimination based on sexual orientation is still legal in the private sector , and that a report from a 2017 public consultation on legal gender recognition has yet to be released . <p> While government policies may take years to fully incorporate equal rights , many members of the LGBTQ+ community are proactively seizing every opportunity to drive small changes . Hundreds of volunteers have helped to build the Gay Games . <p> Emery Fung , a 29-year-old founder of a diversity and inclusion consultancy , is one of them . He helped set up all-gender toilets for participants and arrange some contests to allow people of different genders to play together -- breaking from the tradition of conventional sporting events , which typically segregate players by sex . <p> " I hope that ultimately , there will be a day people wo n't need to specifically state what kind of person I am or what kind of person you are , we just all live together , " he said .

@@103304235 <h> It 's best for PHL to cancel railway deals with China <p> The Department of Transportation ( DOTr ) announced on Monday that the government would no longer pursue Chinese funding for three railway projects amid China 's aggression in the West Philippine Sea . China grossly failed to hold its end of the deal when it promised to fund these railway projects based on executive agreements between Manila and Beijing . As a former cabinet official said , it is best to cancel the deal instead of keeping it in suspended animation . <p> Transportation Secretary Jaime Bautista said official development assistance ( ODA ) from Japan , South Korea , and India , as well as through partnerships with the private sector , will finance the completion of the Philippine National Railways ( PNR ) South Long-Haul Project , the Mindanao Railway Project , and the Subic-Clark Railway Project . <p> President Marcos has previously identified the PNR South Long-Haul Project as a priority of his administration . Also known as the PNR Bicol , this is a 560-kilometer rail system consisting of 35 stations , and will run from Manila through Laguna , Quezon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Sorsogon . <p> The rail system 's passenger trains will be designed to run at a speed of 120 kilometers per hour to 160 kph , and its freight trains designed to run at 80 kph to 100 kph , reducing travel time between Manila and Legazpi City , Albay from the current 14 hours to 18 hours to just six hours in its regular commuter trains and four hours and 30 minutes in its express trains . <p> Much touted by the Duterte administration , the Mindanao Railway Project was originally planned to be constructed in 10 phases , with a total of 2,278 kilometers of track to be built for the system . Phase 1 was supposed to be partially opened between Panabo and Carmen , Davao del Norte in 2022 , and full operations were planned by 2024 . Unfortunately , China , which was expected to fund 80 to 85 percent of the project , totally forgot its commitment . <p> The Subic-Clark Railway Project , which was envisioned to catapult Central Luzon as the next global destination of industrial investments in the country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2020 . However , like the other China-funded railway projects , it got zero funding from Beijing . <p> The Marcos administration 's decision to drop the Chinese loans amid Beijing 's bullying in the South China Sea may yet prove to be a blessing in disguise for the Philippines . As US President Joe Biden recently said , China is engaged in " debt-trap diplomacy , " and it is better to avoid loans that Beijing offers . <p> Pundits said China 's predatory practice is done by deliberately ensnaring developing countries in burdensome loans that the recipient will struggle to repay . By leveraging the debt , Beijing is able to force concessions from the debtor country , such as the acquisition of critical assets and natural resources , and expand the reach of China 's military and navy . Experts cautioned developing countries to avoid Chinese financing or risk falling victim to Beijing 's nefarious design . <p> Earlier , Senators Grace Poe and Sherwin Gatchalian urged President Marcos to seek other sources of financing for the three railway projects . " While appearing attractive , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hefty interest rates and other strings that could be detrimental to the country in the long term , " Poe said , noting that Chinese banks had kept the Philippine government " in suspended animation " with delays in the country 's loan applications . <p> " The withdrawal of the official development assistance from China for the railway projects should not derail the implementation of our infrastructure programs , " Poe added . <p> " We 're working with some other countries for ODAs , we 're exploring these , but we ca n't give any details yet , " Bautista said . <p> On top of ODAs , private sector partners are being sought , and they may serve as contractors similar to the ongoing North-South Commuter Railway and Metro Manila Subway . <p> There 's a lesson we can learn from China 's decision to abandon its commitment to finance the three railway projects .

First , let us turn our attention to the other wars in progress . <p> The war in Ukraine is in the final stages with Russia having achieved its goals through a successful strategy . The goal was to secure a relatively impenetrable fortress wall stretching from Kherson and Crimea eastward to Kharkiv in the north to stop any possible ground attack on Crimea and Russia . Who controls Crimea at least stalemates the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov , which now is completely encircled by Russian territory . <p> The strategy was to move as far westward towards Kyiv to scare NATO so as the European Union and the US would throw billions of dollars into the war effort with the Ukraine throwing away countless lives of its fighting age men . Putin had to go far enough to get Nato to invest treasure but not too far for the West to invest " blood .

First it halted all imports of Ukraine grain . In September , its prime minister , formerly Kyiv 's closest and most vocal ally , said it would " no longer transfer weapons to Ukraine . " <p> The current war between Hamas and Israel is best described for both sides by Hosea 8:7 : " For they have sown the wind , and they shall reap the whirlwind .

This military action has changed the region for the next five years at least , even assuming military action is contained where it is today . What this has done is damage all the proposed and under-construction oil/natural gas pipeline projects in the area directly affecting -- in no particular order -- Saudi Arabia , Greece , T ? rkiye , Syria , Iran , Iraq , Jordan , UAE , Bahrain , Kuwait , and Oman .

For comparison , the US has lost about 100,000 in all of its post-World War 2 wars . <p> The question then is what does China gain from a war with the US over Taiwan/what does it lose ? Simple risk/reward . <p> Beijing potentially gets the island after Taiwan 's $1.6 trillion PPP economy is utterly destroyed , 23 million totally very annoyed Taiwanese , probably $500 a barrel oil , and Kim Jong Un as its only friend .

Those people are the Philippines ' and the world 's most dangerous enemy . <p> China is being a total jackass to the Philippines , and we must be extremely cautious . Looking to other economic and financing partners makes critical good sense . But to tailor our economic and foreign policy based on the belief that China will go to war with the US is not smart and potentially dangerous .

The Roman Empire followed such a similar story from a global power to disintegration . <p> This is the grand theme of a newly released book entitled " Why Empires Fall : Rome , America , and the future of the West " by Peter Heather and John Rapley , published by the Yale University Press , 2023 .

His books include Understanding Development , Globalization and Inequality , and Twilight of the Money Gods : Economics as a Religion and How It All Went Wrong . <p> The book is divided into two parts . Part 1 uses Roman history as the background and framework for understanding the rise of the modern West . It shows the similarities between the economic and political evolution of the modern West and the Roman Empire . It illustrates the domination of the world economy of both periods and then analyzes why this domination can ebb and in fact , is doomed to do so . <p> The two authors in the book purportedly write that the challenge from a developing periphery is now at an early stage . They also write that it was the role of a rising periphery that undermined and caused the collapse of the Roman Empire . <p> Part 2 of the book examines more closely the key factors that caused the Roman collapse . The chapters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In Part 2 , the two authors arrive at conclusions that may not be acceptable to many other historians and political scientists . They write : " It is not possible to make the West great again in the sense of reasserting an unchallenged global dominion , but the necessary process of adjustment can either hardwire the best of Western civilization into an emerging new global order or undermine the best hopes for the continued prosperity of Western populations in a remade world . " <p> Presently , the rise of China is seen as a possible successor to Western dominance . However , this rise has been contested especially in view of the current economic and political problems in China . <p> According to the two authors , the decline of the West began in 2008 when the global economic recession was transformed into an economic stagnation for the West . According to them , the share of the West of global output declined from 80 percent to 60 percent and has continued to fall . Real wages have fallen , youth unemployment has soared , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question that the authors did not sufficiently tackle in my view is that these same factors are happening also in China . <p> Again , the two authors wrote that the self-confidence in the 1990s in the Western liberal democracy has been questioned even in Western democracies and has caused internal divisions . According to them , the authoritarian central planning of the Chinese state has become increasingly influential on the world stage . <p> However , I find authoritarianism has in fact undergone setbacks as several countries have veered away from populist leaders . <p> One of the most interesting topics discussed in the book is the question of the increase in inequality of wealth . The two authors have said that countries that want to reduce internal tensions must find ways for the top 10 percent who benefitted the most from globalization in the last few decades to contribute " ... more resources to build a new type of social-political model .

@@103581232 <h> It 's lonely at the top ( Part 2 ) <p> Yesterday , I presented the story of a lonely religious leader on his dying bed . Today , I will tell the story of a lonely pastor and his ongoing feud with his " music leader . " They can not get along . <p> In the first week , the pastor preached on listening to the will of God and following his will . The music leader led the song " I Shall Not Be Moved . " <p> In the second week , the pastor preached on giving to the Lord 's ministry . The music leader led " Jesus Paid It All . " <p> In the third week , the pastor talked about the sin of gossiping . The music leader led " I Love to Tell the Story . " The pastor became disgusted . The following Sunday , he announced that he was considering resigning the next week . The music leader led " Oh , Why Not Tonight . " <p> On the fifth Sunday , the pastor announced he would resign that day , saying , " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling me to leave . " The music leader led the song " What a Friend We Have in Jesus . " I am sure this pastor must have been a lonely leader . <p> You might be surprised that leaders naturally want to get away from people . It may seem weird to feel lonely because , after all , you 're surrounded by people all day . But being surrounded by people all day can make you feel like you 're in a community when , in reality , it 's not entirely the kind of community you need . <p> And , because leaders are not perfect , serving people in leadership triggers the very instinct inside you that makes you want to get away from people , which is not healthy . <p> One of the best things you can do is to fight your natural urge to resist people and instead seek out people who replenish you . Leadership expert John Townsend says : " Most leaders do n't have a very long list of people who replenish them , and if you end up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer list . " <p> What about social media ? It is a blessing in the sense that we 're more connected than we 've ever been . But relationally , social media creates a sense of false connection . Connecting with 100 people or more you barely know is like eating relational junk food . It feels good for 10 minutes but leaves you feeling defeated and exhausted later . And what that leaves you feeling in the end is alone . <p> Next , you spend all your energy at work . When you take your leadership seriously ( like I do ) , spending 100 percent of your energy at work is easy . Which , of course , means your family gets the leftovers . And it means they get the fumes . When you show up at home exhausted , it 's too easy to expect to be served rather than to serve . And when you give what little you have left to your family ( which is already , by definition , too little ) , you have zero time left over for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To counter that feeling of " It 's lonely at the top , " I need to bring energy home to my family and leave plenty of energy for friends and relationships that nourish me . <p> And what about health , recharging , and rest ? Carey Nieuwhof says : " Full schedules do n't lead to full lives . " The fact is that leaders at the top are never really on , and they are never really off . And it is much more difficult for leaders to get off because there 's always more to be done . You used to go to the office to work ; now , thanks to technology , you take the office wherever you go , so work goes to you and never leaves you . <p> Taking five minutes out of your family 's movie night to answer a few emails or return some texts will take its toll . Unless you guard against it , you live in a perpetual grey zone . The constant present/not present tension of technology leaves you feeling alone . <p> I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lonely at the Top " leadership syndrome , as I am confident that many of you may have already figured out how to deal with this . However , by understanding why there is a price to pay for leadership , we can learn to value the bonds we build , the support we offer , and the connections we nurture . By doing so , we conquer the solitude and fashion an inspiring legacy of compassionate , inclusive , and purposeful leadership that lights the path for others to follow . <p> ( Francis Kong 's podcast " Inspiring Excellence " is now available on Spotify , Apple , Google , or other podcast streaming platforms ) . <p> Red-hot La Salle beat reigning champion Ateneo , 72-69 , as it beefed up its twice-to-beat hopes and dragged its old rival to the brink in the UAAP Season 86 men 's basketball yesterday at the Smart Araneta Coliseum . <p> Gilas naturalized player Justin Brownlee is still in Los Angeles waiting for FIBA 's decision on the duration of his expected suspension after testing positive for a cannabis compound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's basketball gold in Hangzhou last month . <p> Everything has gone full circle for DLSU stars Mike Phillips and Kevin Quiambao after they helped lead the Green Archers to an 11-3 eliminations record in UAAP Season 86 .
