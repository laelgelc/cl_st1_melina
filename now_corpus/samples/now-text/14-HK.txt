The intensely vibrant colours juxtaposed with the striking male model images evoke strong feelings of desire and passion which belie artist Herman Wong Yee-tak 's commentary on the loneliness and pain felt by some gay men in modern society . " Within the hopelessness there is still desire , " says Wong of this painting , titled Relationships , before he adds that the piece represents the ' rather tenuous relationships ' and ' lack of spiritual connection ' between gay men . " Would n't you agree ? " he asks . " From the people I know and from my own friends , it seems there is an inescapable struggle . The red lake represents the pain and hurt while you can also see that all the men are by themselves and lonely . Yet there is still a colourful desire -- lust even . " <p> For Wong 's upcoming solo show , Come and Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kip Mei , he displays a provocative male series of paintings featuring half-naked Asian men , which have all been created by using only a special painting knife , as well as engaging in a technique that nods to the likes of Luican Freud . " It 's quite aggressive , " says Wong . " For this show I wanted to play on bold colours and exaggerated expressions . " Of course , there 's a strong homoerotic element in this series as well . Wong says he does n't want to be labelled as a ' gay artist ' -- but does admit that he has garnered interest in his homoerotic art due to the simple lack of it in Hong Kong 's galleries . " There is n't anyone really doing gay art or nudes in Hong Kong , " he says . " I felt that I should take this opportunity and do something that has n't been overdone here already . " <p> Wong is clearly hugely talented and skilled when it comes to painting . So it 's surprising to learn that the 44-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . His full-time occupation for the past 18 years has actually been as a flight attendant for Cathay Pacific . However , he admits to always being interested in the arts . He once studied at the Hong Kong Academy of Performing Arts , focusing on both clothing design and film production . After that , he pursued a career in film as a creative director all the way up until he was 26 -- but then was forced to change course . " By that time it was the mid-90s and finding projects to work on in film became difficult , " he says . " The Hong Kong film industry really tanked post-Stephen Chow . " As a result , Wong took to the air and confesses he has never looked back -- but he also admits to feeling ' unfulfilled ' at the same time . <p> But , since 2008 , Wong has been on the pursuit towards his dreams . He says he had always yearned to have his own solo exhibition , so , from that year , he started turning his hobby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a joint exhibition at the Des Montagnes Studio . In 2012 , he gained his first award nomination , when he was a finalist for the Art Award at the HK Contemporary Art Fair . Last year , he displayed his work at the Hong Kong Lesbian and Gay Film Festival opening gala . And now he 's ready to showcase his first collection . " The feelings and emotions that are felt in this collection are between two men , " says Wong . " Some of the pieces have a purposeful sex appeal and provocation . The men have pretty faces and bodies that people would want to worship -- so it 's meant to be eye-catching . " <p> There 's no doubt that the paintings will arouse a few onlookers . But they should also make the viewer stop and think too .

@@2409232 <h> Rentenbank 's Kangaroo bond volumes reach record <p> Head of treasury Stefan Goebel said increased volumes have been made possible by a strong offshore bid <p> German agricultural lender Rentenbank expects its Australian dollar bond programme to soon reach A$12 billion , cementing its position as the third-largest issuer of Kangaroo bonds behind KfW and the European Investment Bank . <p> The bank has been a consistent issuer in the market since 2002 and recorded its biggest volumes ever in 2013 when it issued A$2.85 billion in Australian dollar bonds . <p> Kangaroos now represent 21% of all Rentenbank 's medium- and long-term funding . <p> On a non-deal roadshow through Southeast Asia and Australia this week , the bank 's head of treasury Stefan Goebel and head of funding Leopold Olma said the market would remain attractive thanks to robust investor appetite and an ability to execute cross-currency swaps . <p> The increased volumes in recent years have been made possible by a strong offshore bid , predominately from Asia-based accounts . Order books are routinely split 80/20 in favour of offshore investors . <p> The sweet spot is in 10-year bonds , where Japanese life insurance companies are the biggest buyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tend to buy in the five-year space , " Goebel said . <p> Rentenbank still issues debt denominated in US dollars but favours the Australian dollar over other currencies such as the Japanese yen and Swiss franc . " We have n't issued in yen since 2007 and Swiss franc since 2011 , when the cost-over-swap for these currencies moved massively out of kilter and way beyond our target spreads versus six-month Euribor , " Goebel said . <p> He said Kangaroo bonds came close to being too expensive in 2007 and 2008 but the market has since recovered and there is nothing on the horizon to indicate a change in current conditions . <p> " The swap market is impacted by the Australian commercial banks and the size of their offshore fundraising programmes . While they continue to issue in foreign currencies and swap back into Aussie dollars , we can take advantage of the other side of the swap from Aussie into euro .

" We have 10 active lines that we increase by making regular taps . The more liquid each line gets , the more additional demand it triggers . " <p> Investors are attracted to this liquidity but they also like Rentenbank 's rock-solid credit standing , courtesy of a full government guarantee on its bonds introduced by German lawmakers last year . " We do n't get any questions about our credit quality on roadshows , " quipped Goebel . <p> Looking ahead , Rentenbank faces two heavy years of redemptions with A$1.2 billion worth of Kangaroo bonds due to mature in 2014 and another A$1.3 billion in 2015 . Goebel and Olma are confident these levels can be covered . " It would be nice to issue more than the A$1.2 billion that will redeem this year , and we might still achieve that , " Olma said . <p> Asked whether the bank intends to alter its bond maturities in the medium term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might consider a 10.5-year or 11-year deal . Beyond this , he has little interest in longer-dated paper , despite Australian government moves to extend the bond curve out to 20 years . <p> " Anything longer than 11 years does n't match our liability profile , " he said . " And it also becomes harder for the underwriting banks to crunch the numbers on the cross-currency swap . "
