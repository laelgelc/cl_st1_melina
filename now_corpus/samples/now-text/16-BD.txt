On Facebook , this is the person who will put up a long status message about how sad s/he is , and how close s/he was to the person . This is not to say that such people may not genuinely be sad at the death , but broadcasting it is more of an exercise in narcissism than it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , genuine tears aside , consider sticking to " I 'm sorry for your loss/praying for you " as opposed to " Oh , I have been depressed , sad , angry since I heard ....

" What time did he die ? How ? When ? Where ? " On comment threads on social media , even if the questions have been answered , you 'll find someone who has n't bothered reading the answers and has to ask them all over again .

Let the mourner know you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but do n't press for details . <p> The Fixer Admittedly , arranging a janaza is a chaotic process .

Having said that , you 're bound to encounter one loudmouth who will stomp in and start barking orders , snapping at people about how lousy the sound-system is , or how there are n't enough boxes of sweets , and interestingly enough , this person is usually someone who is n't actually responsible for doing any of those things .

The stoic grievers will be advised to " let it all out " , and the dry-eyed criticised in audible whispers for their lack of a display of sadness . On the flipside , there are actually people who will tell you to snap out of it , or narrow it down to adages such as " Death comes for us all " and expect the grief to magically disappear . When speaking with the mourners , it is perhaps best not to tell them how to feel . Just express your condolences and be there for them . It goes a long way . <p> The Blame Game Sometimes , death comes after illness or injury . It is natural to feel a certain amount of guilt and self doubt as to whether or not one has done all they could for the one that passed away .

@@10337231 <h> High-tech and the widening rich-poor gap <p> The global economy faced the tumultuous recession , sluggish capital markets and dead-slow recovery during the last few years that changed the economic and social scenarios in developed and developing economies alike . In trying to ride out the difficulties , business communities and the industrialists are adopting most advanced technologies in the fields of production , marketing and distribution . There are successes achieved by the stakeholders in increasing their net worth at national and international levels . This picture is one-side of the coin . The sleazy picture on the other side is the inequality of income and the ever-increasing gap between the rich and the poor . It should n't be a surprise that the economic super-powers like the USA have recorded sharp rise in poverty . Report of the Census Bureau says 46 million Americans-15 per cent of the population -- were living below the poverty line although the Americans have been using most of the advanced and sophisticated high-tech industries and businesses .

In turn , GDP ( gross domestic product ) would uplift due to the evolution of technology whilst average income and employment figures may indeed shrivel at the same time , breeding greater inequality between the fortune makers and unfortunate takers . It can be prudently said that high-tech is likely to drag on the gap between the richest and the poorest as wealthier individuals and nations will be presented with more prospects , that is more wealth , more net worth and more prosperity compared to those with the tiny salary and low wages . <p> A technological trauma will indeed deplete demand for low skilled workers , but it is likely that such workers will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depends on the flexibility of the labour force in regards to changes in technology .

Unemployment is on the upswing within sectors that are mainly based around administration and service works . However , at the same time employment opportunities are on the surge for labour whose skills are complementary to new technology , for instance , workers skilled and educated in IT and engineering related disciplines .

During the same period , inequality in China has been declining . <p> This poses a challenge for policymakers . Free market capitalism has proved itself to be the best system for driving income growth and creating a large economic surplus . And yet , when it comes to the distribution of income , it performs far less well . <p> Most democratic societies have attempted to address the problem through left-leaning redistributive policies or right-leaning supply-side approaches . But neither seems to be particularly effective . In the US , income inequality has steadily widened under both Democratic and Republican administrations .

Books on pure science , math , botany , zoology , engineering , astronomy , cosmology , environment and technology , including information and communication technology , are conspicuous by their absence . <p> If this is the measure of intellectual and creative output of a nation , there is indeed cause for serious concern . Admittedly , a handful of poetry or novels become so popular that they are sold like hot cake . But popularity is no measure of a masterpiece . Let alone the creations of the old masters , where are classics like Putul Nacher Itikatha , Chander Amabasya or even Chile Kothar Sepai ? <p> A kind of creative dementia has set in on the one hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lagging behind in accommodating the developments on the science and technology front . The result is a kind of stagnation of Bangla or at times vacuum because of the lack of appropriate expression . But Nature does not tolerate any such void , so aberration of language in the form of a hybrid kind fills up the vacuum . The best example of this is the language used for short message service ( SMS ) . <p> Bangla may be the seventh largest language in terms of people who use it as their mother tongue , but indications are that it is on a course of retrogression . The indifference shown to the language at the primary or secondary level is matched by lack of any organised effort to develop it to be equal to the subjects of higher studies in different branches of knowledge . <p> In fact , language is like a living animal . It survives because it has the capability to capture the core meaning of human minds and abstract ideas - be it in relation to philosophy , science , math or humanities . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the peoples of far smaller size than the Bangla-speaking people like the French , Italians and South Koreans have not found their mother tongue inadequate in pursuing higher studies or research . <p> A language does not receive its nourishment through literature alone . Even in that area , Bangla has to depend mostly on its past glories , not much to count in the new millennium . This is really troubling . If this trend continues , how can this language be a vehicle of carrying the meaning of intense and complex realities and subjects ? Books of poems and fiction - those too dealing with cheap feeling and emotion - alone can not guarantee the immortality of a language . <p> Language is like the current of water . It must flow in order to stay in health . But that process stops once its users lose their touch with the stream of human consciousness . The most robust languages are those that have been liberal enough in accepting words and concepts from different cultures and climes . Highly developed languages like Latin and Sanskrit have become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the changing circumstances all around . Until or unless , a language is simple as well as complex enough to meet the need of all segments of society , it finds itself out of context . <p> This does not mean that a standard dialect among their different variations will not be welcome to all . Here is a challenge to maintain the taste and sophistication , colour and images that a language has to capture the essence of a situation , feeling and emotion , geometric pattern and abstract ideas . Bangla is definitely losing out to foreign languages , particularly English . Literary luminaries of the past have left a rich legacy for their ancestors to build on . In the areas of science or technology the same is not true . <p> However , some brilliant products of this country have proved their talent by leading a few epoch-making researches on foreign soil , the United States of America in particular .

Albeit the 21st day of February , 1952 has now shaped into an abstract idea , the sacrifice made by the people for the love of language still continues to be the fountainhead of their ethnic identity . Ethnicity of a people has other ingredients but for the Bangalees , its most powerful one is their language . On that count , the language - as the medium of expression of the national ethos , custom , culture , social mores , collective hopes and aspiration - should have achieved more than what it has done . If the country 's independence owes to the language movement , a mass protest that brought the people together against the conspiracy of language colonialism , devotion and dedication to the mother tongue should have by now gone beyond the numerical status of seventh position in the world . <p> Much as the people here are prone to making protestation of love for Bangla , in reality it is not at all substantiated by a neutral analysis .

Woefully , the nation can not even boast enough text books required for higher studies in different subjects .

Has the nation done enough to absorb the currents and cross-currents of developments in various fields of human knowledge now undergoing a radical transformation ? The answer to this question will be a big ' No ' . The love for the language and the land has long disappeared to be replaced by narrow and selfish interests . Clearly , language was once synonymous with the nation 's identity . The nation has moved away from that central position of language and is paying a heavy prize for this in terms of aberration in so many forms .

I agree sensible commentary is the exception rather than the rule but if you can be bothered to plough through the pantomime villain stuff there is the odd gem . <p> Over time , I have found one or two posters to be knowledgable and able to provide insight or indeed new information that has been beneficial in evaluating a position .

I stopped using ADVFN after a year and cancelled after two . They make cancelling very hard ( it has to be done by letter ) which says a lot about ADVFN . I would urge any newbie to avoid ADVFN , III or LSE . <p> As for Blogs I read SCVR , JIC , John Kingham and when I remember ( he does not email or tweet ) Naked Trader .

For those that are wondering about LEAST discussed stocks , they tend to be those in the FTSE100 , regarded as boring and with more perfect information embedded in their shareprices . On the contrary , the most discussed tend to be small mid caps , as Ed points out - " Story " stocks . Its also because these shares are less well covered by City analysts , so the educated ( or even uneducated ) investor can find out a few facts that are others do nt know and can feel part of the debate . <p> Most of my investment and SIPP portfolios have core holidngs in large and mid cap companies , typically ' boring ' cash compounders with the odd smattering of interesting small cap growth or recovery positions added in . Like most I read SCVR to get a few ideas . You just have to have your antenna up for when you feel shares are over hyped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? It reminds me of the famous anecdote of Joe Kennedy ( or JP Morgan , no-one seems to know ) who sold their entire holdings of equities right before the 1929 crash after they received investment tips from the shoe shine boy . <p> I think a rules based portfolio is good for some investors as it makes the investor become more dispassionate / rational , however I try and combine the 2 approaches . I screen for cheap good quality shares with proven ' moats ' . But then , unlike a rules based approach , I investigate the companies and pick only c15 which I hold for the long term and do nt rebalance much as this involves frictional trading costs . These shares eg Imperial Brands , BAT , Sage etc have all compounded way ahead of the market . Occasionally they do get expensive but i tend to hold for years .

When I shorted Afren , after working out that the equity was toast , due to bond obligations , I amused myself by reading the utter garbage that bulls were writing about the shares on advfn . It soon became readily apparent that these people were completely unsophisticated , and had no idea what they were doing - they did n't understand the basics of investing , or company accounts . So it was easy money . <p> Same with Globo , and Quindell . The bulls were utterly clueless , which they amply demonstrated on bulletin boards . <p> Whereas a totally silent bulletin board is very often a wonderful confirmation that you 've found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it being a gem .

For the longest period of time , your country , The United States of America , stood tall . It stood as the champion of human rights , freedom of speech , freedom of religion , and a land of opportunity . <p> For a very long period in history and , mostly after the Second World War , the US was the light at the end of the tunnel for immigrants across the world . The world respected your system of democracy , social balance , and fair governance . Although your system had some flaws , it nonetheless provided a safe haven for many who were fleeing persecution , tyranny , and injustice . <p> Millions called the new land their new home .

When you said , " give me your tired , your poor , your huddled masses yearning to breathe free ... " a new conscience of humanity beaconed . <p> Dear Americans , now you have elected a man as your president who heralds racism , misogyny , and demagoguery . <p> He used every single trick in the book to use hate against each other and to conquer by inciting division . This marks a clear turning point in your history . This is a clear indication that most of you no longer believe in an open arm invitation to the rest of the world . <p> Actually , most of the countries around the world have much less tolerance for " foreigners .

So , all you Trump supporters , all you arrogant Hillary supporters , all of you in the liberal media who are completely detached from the reality , and all you social liberals spewing self-righteousness from your ivory towers and thumping your ideology onto everyone and calling Trump supporters " stupid " -- words can not express my ire for any of you . <p> None of those who chose Trump are from another country .

Chinese regulators can shut WWE 's operations down at any time if they deem them inconsistent with the country 's values . <p> Earlier this year , Chinese regulators unexpectedly forced Alibaba Group Holding to end its online streaming partnership with Walt Disney Co just months after it was launched , to comply with recent regulations limiting foreign content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down Apple Inc 's online book and movie sales in China . <p> WWE may also come to rue its close ties with US President-elect Donald Trump , a member of the WWE Hall of Fame who used to appear regularly at matches . <p> Trump used China as a regular punching bag during his campaign and caused ire in Beijing last week by taking a congratulatory call from Taiwan 's president , breaching decades of diplomatic practice . <p> Trump picked WWE co-founder Linda McMahon as head of the US Small Business Administration on Wednesday , deepening his connection with the company . Nevertheless , WWE is not concerned its ties with the Trump administration might affect its effort in China , according to a source familiar with the situation , who wished to remain anonymous . <p> WWE 's partnership with PPTV , which is owned by Chinese conglomerate Suning Holdings Group , may protect against any backlash because its parent has close ties to the Chinese government , industry experts said . <p> The Chinese government does not pre-approve scripts . WWE does post videos of Wang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can track his progress , said Paul " Triple H " Levesque , whose is WWE 's head of talent and live events . <p> Physical theatre <p> In June , Levesque went to Shanghai to audition Chinese athletes to come to Orlando for training . <p> " The biggest thing we look for is charisma , " Levesque said , on a recent visit to Orlando . WWE is also keen to find talent with a story that will resonate in China . <p> For example , one woman athlete from a rural village in northern China had not told her parents she was auditioning . When asked what she would do if she was accepted , she said she would have to disobey them and follow her dream . <p> Telling that story to young girls across China , where women are beginning to chart their own paths , is hugely powerful , Levesque said . That woman will arrive in Orlando in January . <p> WWE believes the underlying story line of good versus evil will translate to China , and it is a matter of helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertainment , Levesque said : " It 's physical theatre . " <p> At WWE 's performance centre in Orlando , there are two remote-controlled cameras beaming practice sessions to head office in Stamford . One live streams into WWE Chief Executive Vince McMahon 's office and the other into Levesque 's office , an indication of how important new talent is to WWE . <p> " I leave it on in my office all the time , " Levesque said . <p> Wang , who stands 6 feet 3 inches ( 1.9m ) , is one of the fighters hoping he will stand out and capture the bosses ' attention , and ultimately , that of his country . 
@@15817232 <h> Probe body finds ... negligence in preventing BB heist <h> A Bangladesh government-appointed panel investigating the cyber heist of $81 million from its central bank in February has found five officials at the bank guilty of negligence and carelessness , the head of the panel told Reuters on Thursday . <p> In his first detailed comments on the inquiry since a report was submitted to the government in May , former central bank governor Mohammed Farashuddin said the officials were low to mid-level and were not directly involved in the crime . <p> " They were negligent , careless and indirect accomplices , " he said in an interview in his office . " The committee came to the conclusion that the heist was essentially committed by external elements . " <p> Farashuddin did not name the officials he had found to be negligent , while Bangladesh Bank spokesman Subhankar Saha declined comment . <p> A senior central bank official , speaking on condition of anonymity , said no action had been taken against any employee since Bangladesh has so far refused to make the inquiry report public , preferring instead to deny perpetrators knowledge of the investigation into one of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known if Bangladesh had shared the report with the US Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) , the main agency investigating the crime . <h> Complex heist <p> Although over 10 months have passed since the heist , there have been no arrests and no word on who carried out the complex heist . <p> Hackers used stolen credentials to try to transfer nearly $1 billion from Bangladesh Bank 's account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York through the SWIFT transaction system . Many of the transfer orders were blocked or reversed but $81 million was sent to accounts in a branch of Rizal Commercial Banking Corp ( RCBC ) in the Philippines . <p> The money eventually went into the sprawling casino industry in the Philippines and most of it remains untraced . <p> Like Bangladesh police investigators , Farashuddin said the inquiry panel also found the hackers may have exploited loopholes in the bank 's online security when technicians hooked up the central bank 's local money transfer system with SWIFT 's international payments network late last year . <p> SWIFT has denied charges that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hackers . <h> Weaknesses exposed <p> Reuters has reported earlier that Bangladesh Bank had not protected its computer system with a firewall , and used second-hand $10 electronic switches to network computers linked to SWIFT , weaknesses that the hackers may also have exploited . <p> Farashuddin said that RCBC was responsible for allowing the stolen funds to be withdrawn and disbursed into the casino industry and that Bangladesh wants RCBC to compensate it for its losses . <p> RCBC , however , has said Bangladesh Bank was " negligent " in letting the initial security breach take place there , and hence the Manila-based bank need not pay any compensation . So far only about $15 million of the stolen funds have been recovered . <p> Farashuddin said his personal opinion was it would be better to make the inquiry report public , since it would make clear that some local officials were negligent but not responsible for the heist . <p> " If the government would publish , then Bangladesh Bank 's position would be strengthened , " he said . <p> Bangladesh 's law minister said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the inquiry with Philippine authorities .
