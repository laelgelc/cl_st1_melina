@@91290231 <p> FRANKSON ... we started with one machine and one mixing pot . The first order I got was for 200 gallons of furniture finishing . ( Photo : Joseph Wellington ) <p> IT 'S now 33 years since Doreen Frankson , a self-styled nationalist , started her paint company , EdgeChem Jamaica Limited , but the passion and drive which got her started in the first place still burn as bright , if not brighter now , than when she started . <p> But EdgeChem was not her first company . Frankson said when she left school , she was invited by a business partner to form her first company , Steinhol Chemicals , an entity which produced glues and adhesives . <p> During the interview for this piece , Frankson reflected on the highs and lows , her face beaming with pride as she told a story of joy and pain , but one she said which brought so much achievement , she would encourage anyone to experience it . <p> " As a young girl , I used to hang out with Carlton Alexander , Vin Henderson-Davis , Ray Hadeed , and those men were powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young miss to look at manufacturing because they lived and dreamed manufacturing , " she started . <p> " That was where I got my passion from . Making something , doing something . I would not be able to import and sell anything to save my life . I do n't know how to do that . But give me something to produce and I will produce it . So that 's what I did . " <p> She said she has never sought a job , working only at two companies in her life , and in both she was a co-owner . <p> " I left school and went straight into manufacturing after a friend of mine , who was majority shareholder , invited me to be part of the entity , " she said of her first foray into business in 1971 with Steinhol Chemicals . <p> Frankson said she spent about 20 years there before leaving in 1991 to start EdgeChem . But her leaving was due to her business partner dying . Not feeling like she wanted to continue , she said she sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EdgeChem products in the warehouse at its logistics centre ( Photo : Joseph Wellington ) <p> " We started with a seed capital of $1 million in 1991 , " she said . Though that was a lot of money then , Frankson said it was just about half of the $1.9 million the business plan required for the start-up , and so she raised additional capital through preference shares from the now-defunct Trafalgar Development Bank . <p> But raising capital was to be the least of her worries at the beginning . <p> " I rented a place in Olympic Gardens ( St Andrew ) and when I went there , the don man business started , " she said . <p> She recalled then that a man identifying himself as the don turned up at her fledgling start-up , a location which she had rented to produce furniture finishes for what was then a booming industry , and told her that she must pay him money every Friday to continue operating . But Frankson said that did n't faze her and she did n't accede to the request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ donmanship , so I informed them I 'm not paying any extortion money , " Frankson said . <p> But that stance was not overlooked by the don and his cronies . <p> Frankson said on the Friday of her first week of operation , she got a delivery of solvents to produce her furniture finishes and left it in stores over the weekend . Returning on Monday , she said it was discovered that the plug which caulked the drum holding the chemicals was released and all the raw material was leaked on the floor . The men who she refused to pay , she said , did it to get back at her . It was then that she was determined to leave Olympic Gardens rather than deal with the dons . She left in 1993 after buying her current location from the Urban Development Corporation ( UDC ) . <p> Still , in that first year , she said business was good , with sales reaching $10.8 million . <p> A display of some of the products from EdgeChem Jamaica Limited . ( Photo : Joseph Wellington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of good furniture . You know , they made mahogany furniture and we used to export them . So furniture finishes were heavily demanded . I did a survey and found that Sherwin Williams -- a paint producer -- was the only contender , and people felt that they did n't have any option and they just had to take whatever price or whatever they gave them . So I saw the gaps and then sought to fill them , " she told the Jamaica Observer . <p> In that year , Frankson said the company netted profits of $710,000 . <p> As she read the numbers from prepared notes , the EdgeChem CEO paused to reflect on her first day at the company . <p> " We started with one machine and one mixing pot , " she said . " The first order I got was for 200 gallons of furniture finishing . I slept on the pallet the night to get out that order , because it was only three of us at the time . That was a big order for us at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that now that would be a drop in the bucket for her company . <p> Doreen Frankson poses with her products . ( Photo : Joseph Wellington ) <p> But that dedication paid off despite challenges she faced operating in the tough St Andrew neighbourhood . Frankson said business picked up quickly , and in the following years , the company recorded sales growth of 25 per cent and 50 per cent in 1992 and 1993 . <p> " When we started with furniture finishes , people were coming in and asking for other products , such as body fillers , which we started to make . We also added automotive paints and industrial paints . We added decorative paints last , " she recalled . <p> But with issues with dons still lurking in the background , she said she moved quickly to build the first phase of the factory from which she operates now in less than 12 months and moved in 1995 . <p> " We were always very uncomfortable . And what it meant , we were n't able to work at night because you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we survived . " <p> When she moved , she said growth took off even more . Sales doubled in 1995 from the level it was in 1994 , the last year she produced from the facility in Olympic Gardens before levelling off in the mid-20 per cent growth a few years after . <p> Despite finding success , she said she had to face challenges because of her gender . <p> " I recognised it early . My partners were all men and that was for a specific reason , because they would front the business , right . And I remember going into a bank , it was Worker 's Bank , to get some working capital and the man was so disrespectful to me that I said to my partner that went with me , ' Let 's take our papers and get out of here . ' " <p> Still , she said those issues did n't daunt her . Growing up in St Mary and Portland , she said she was taught that she can achieve anything a man can , and that drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> One of those odds was accepting her products . Frankson said when she got into the consumer side of the business , having started first selling directly to other businesses , she was blocked . The large hardwares did not want to buy her products . <p> " So I said , ' Okay , when one door closes , another one opens . ' So I opened my first retail location at Hagley Park Road St Andrew and I have not looked back since . " <p> She said the success she saw in her own retail outlets pushed her to open more . Now EdgeChem has 25 retail stores across the island , with a store in every parish except St Thomas . <p> " I opened a store during COVID . I opened a branch on Molynes Road in the midst of COVID . " After that , she said another store was opened in Falmouth , and most recently a branch was opened in Fairfield in Montego Bay , St James . <p> EdgeChem now distributes about a half of its output through those stores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other half , including in the export markets in the Caribbean and Florida . <p> " We export our automotive and industrial lines to the United States , " Frankson said as she emphasised that going forward the company will be looking for more growth outside Jamaica . <p> " Our strategy is to do exactly what we have done in Jamaica to provide good quality products , good customer service , and reasonably priced products to the end user . " <p> " Now we are looking at Panama and other countries as we go along . " <p> But like most manufacturers , Frankson bemoans the cost of operating in Jamaica , applauding those who are able to export , given the circumstances . <p> " You know , we have a lot of international companies here . We are the only fully owned Jamaican paint company , and the Jamaican people have stayed with us and they have helped us to grow , and we are eternally grateful to them , " she said . <p> She said when she just started , the big international paint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're losing sight of is that not only is EdgeChem a company that was founded and grown by a woman , but one who took on the international companies like a Sherwin Williams , took on a Berger Paints , I took on all of them , " she said . Now she says they look at her differently and see her as a serious competitor . <p> But while starting with furniture finishes , Frankson has now grown the product line to more than 200 in four categories -- furniture finishes , automotive finishes , industrial paints , and decorative paints . <p> She said she is proud of the innovations her company has been credited for , name checking the Automel brand of automotive products which was " developed right downstairs by a young Jamaican chemist " . <p> " I 'm the pioneer of automotive clinics in Jamaica , getting all of the mechanics together and teaching them about the products and all of that . We pounded the pavement because , again , I ca n't take on the international boys with money , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of funding . We still do n't , and so we had to build market share through direct selling . " <p> Despite advancing years , Frankson said she has no desire to retire anytime soon and is planning the next phase of growth for EdgeChem . <p> " I enjoy and love what I do , and it is my passion . EdgeChem is my passion , so retirement is not on the cards right now , " she told the Business Observer . <p> " It has been a journey of a lot of success , with a lot of challenges , but it has been very satisfying , and I intend to leave my footprints for this , because I think we have a story and I think we are now a force to be reckoned with in the marketplace . " <p> " It has had its sacrifices , because during those long hours and long days , and time without pay , and all of those sacrifices , I did n't balance my time well to have a family of my own . So that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a lot of children , but I do n't have any biological children , " Frankson said as she counted her words , showing emotions for the first time during the interview . <p> " It has been a journey of pain , a journey of joy , a journey of accomplishment . I do n't have anything else to prove . I 've done it all , " she said . <p> For her , the staff has been wonderful and her interaction with them makes her " feel loved as a CEO " . <p> The dedication of her staff , she said , was on display during the COVID-19 pandemic , helping the company to rack up 20 per cent growth for each of the years when the economy was largely on lockdown . <p> " We have a lot of EdgeChem babies , where my staff bring them to work and put them in a basket at their feet while they work .

@@91373237 <p> A wedding and a funeral recently led to me and my five-year-old son visiting Jamaica from Japan for a whopping three days . <p> As we were about to get off the plane in Kingston , he said to me , " The Japanese flag looks like a grater cake , right ? " He had never actually seen the dessert , but he had read Jean Dacosta 's Jamaica In My Tummy , which mentions it . Maybe because I was doing some reckoning of worlds myself , I reasoned the child was saying in his own way , even if these two places are completely different , like I suspect they are , at least they have that one element of design in common . <p> There was no more guessing for the rest of the trip , though . His demands were straightforward : coconuts , fried dumplings , the Jamaican beach , frogs and , of course , grater cake . He very vocally wanted these things he associated with Jamaica , but I soon realised I had a Japanese child in Jamaica . Or , more accurately , a child in a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a trip four years ago long gone , he clung to me at every turn . <p> Taiyu plays with coconuts <p> On our previous trip , he delightfully ate mangoes . This time , he did , too , but seemed concerned about all the juice running down his hands . I was n't about to peel and cut . That 's not the Jamaican way . <p> Amid the shyness , he still managed to cross everything off his to-do list . He drank coconut water as soon as we came out of the airport ; climbed an apple tree , tried to climb a coconut tree ; played with coconuts ( did n't want to eat the flesh ) ; saw not one , but two brown frogs in a puddle made bright orange by the Manchester soil ; and went to the Jamaican beach twice . The grater cake , however , was a bit of a disappointment . What he had in mind was a white square with a pink dot in the middle . The one we found had two equal layers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square . Never mind the sugariness , which he 's usually overjoyed about , it did n't look how it was supposed to . The fried dumpling , he got on the morning we left . For the first time in the three days we were there , he finished all his food , and asked for more . <p> About a week later , in the departure lounge of an American airport while we waited for a flight back to Japan , bits of pieces of a language we had hardly heard in two weeks ( we spent some time in the US too ) , started flitting through the air . He accurately observed , " There are Japanese people here . " <p> Some questions he asked me after we had left Jamaica : " Is there mango in all countries where they speak patois ? " " Are there English-speaking people in Japan too ? " Several weeks later at the entrance of his nursery school : " Are there other Jamaican people here ?

Apparently feeling that I had n't given the reaction he was expecting , he said , " That was patois . " During the trip he did try some patois without noticing it , sometimes using " mi " to refer to himself , for example . <p> He might have been shy and overwhelmed but I think he picked up many things during the trip , including things I wo n't ever know . In a recent conversation he said , quite suddenly , " Victoria Town is in Jamaica , right ? Victoria Town is where I played with the coconuts and the mangoes at your house .

Among them , $100 million worth of assets to a businessman based in western Jamaica ; $100 million to the Jamaica Teachers ' Association ( JTA ) ; and nearly $60 million to local conglomerate Facey Commodity Limited . <p> And the FID has already gone to court and obtained an order freezing assets worth millions of dollars that have been traced to Andrea Gordon , the former National Commercial Bank ( NCB ) senior manager serving a seven-year prison sentence for defrauding the financial institution of some $34 million . <h> Headlines Delivered to Your Inbox <p> The court is to rule on an application for the assets to be forfeited and turned over to NCB . <p> In the case of the western Jamaica businessman , his company was reportedly defrauded through an elaborate petroleum-stealing racket and the money used to acquire several assets , including real estate , Keith Darien , principal director of the FID , told The Sunday Gleaner . <p> " At the end of the day , it was agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company , " Darien said . <p> The assets turned over to the JTA include three St Andrew homes , which the accused fraudster , former accounting clerk Marlon Francis , purchased in his name and the names of his mother and aunt . <p> A three-storey seven-bedroom mansion erected in Ewarton , St Catherine , was turned over to Facey Commodity Limited after investigations revealed that it was financed through the proceeds of a $50-million phonecard scam orchestrated by a former employee , Shauna Lee Tucker . <p> Tucker was convicted for money laundering and slapped with a $3 million fine . <p> Further , the FID said US authorities have obtained a forfeiture order for over US$5,000 as well as jewellery , which were seized from popular Jamaican disc-jockey ZJ Wah Wa , whose real name is Deon-ville O'Hara , after his arrest there on lottery scam-related charges .

The ultimatum expires on Friday , January 27 . Bolt has been doing business with SSL for 10 years and has one of the largest portfolios with the firm . <h> ONE OF THE LARGEST FINANCIAL FALLOUTS IN MODERN JAMAICAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high interest rates triggered an explosion in the number of unregulated investment schemes operating in Jamaica . <p> With a market share of about 46 per cent , Cash Plus was easily the largest of at least 16 such schemes that were in operation at the time , according to a 2008 study conducted by the Caribbean Policy Research Institute . <p> But their operations began crumbling under tighter monitoring by the Financial Services Commission ( FSC ) and pressure from commercial banks , triggering one of the largest financial fallouts in modern Jamaican history . <p> The Offices of the Government Trustee ( OGT ) , which is also the liquidator of assets owned by Cash Plus , acknowledged , in a public statement on July 6 , 2017 , that approximately J$827.5 million and US$1.16 million had been recovered mainly from rental income , the sale of properties and payments made to settle liabilities owed to the Cash Plus Group . <p> Those funds , the OGT said , were insufficient to cover day-to-day expenses such as payments to interim employees and priority statutory deductions which must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jamaicans , lost more than US$220 million in the failed OLINT scheme . And it is estimated that World Wise investors lost approximately $200 million . <p> The majority of the victims are yet to recover any of the funds . <p> Responding to questions submitted by The Sunday Gleaner on Friday , the OGT said there are various classes of creditors " and the depositors are one such class " . <p> " The liquidation advances with a view to declare a dividend to all classes of creditors . Moreover , the exercise of this liquidation is complex , multi-jurisdictional , extensive and resource extensive , " the agency noted . <p> By comparison , the United States Department of Justice announced last September that it commenced an eighth round of pay-outs to victims of the billion-dollar Ponzi scheme orchestrated by late American financier Bernard Madoff . <p> At the time of his arrest in December 2008 , the Bernard L Madoff Investment Scheme ( BLMIS ) had fleeced over 40,000 investors in 125 countries of over US$7 billion , according to US authorities . <p> A total of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest pay-out . <p> And in September 2021 , a court-appointed receiver for the US$7.2 billion Ponzi scheme orchestrated by Texas financier Allen Stanford announced that a total of US$1 billion had been recovered for distribution to victims . <p> Stanford is serving a 110-year prison sentence for the fraud , which was uncovered in 2009 and impacted approximately 18,000 investors . <h> OLINT , WORLD WISE , CASH PLUS <p> David Smith , the former OLINT boss , was never prosecuted in Jamaica , though he was convicted for money laundering and other criminal offences in the US and the Turks and Caicos Islands ( TCI ) . <p> Smith was released from a TCI prison in October 2020 after serving 10 years , authorities there confirmed . <p> World Wise founder Noel Strachan left Jamaica for the US after the scheme folded and has denied operating a Ponzi scheme . <p> In an exclusive interview with this newspaper in 2015 , Strachan laughed at claims that he used investors ' money to purchase a private jet , several luxury vehicles and pricey real estate , including a million-dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was charged with fraudulently inducing investors , but the disappearance of a key prosecution witness caused his trial to quickly collapse after years of delay . <p> Adley Duncan , a former prosecutor in the case , told The Sunday Gleaner last week that there was evidence to support a claim that Cash Plus was not solvent enough to fulfil the promised return on investment . <p> " The company was not in a position to fulfil what Mr Hill was promising and Mr Hill would have known that because of the meetings he had , what was told to him , and his acquaintance with the company 's financials , " claimed Duncan . <p> But he said an accountant and other technical employees who provided witness statements did not show up to give evidence in court . <p> " We had statements from investors , but those statements were helpful only up to a point because we had to prove not only that the promises were made , ... but that the promises could not be made good on and that the person making the promise knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , explaining the decision to set the former Cash Plus boss free in 2017 . <h> MULTIPLE LAYERS TO HIDE FUNDS <p> According to the FID principal director , low-level fraudsters typically use their ill-gotten gains to finance " normal household expenditures " , while those involved in high-stakes fraud generally seek to acquire assets , including real estate and motor vehicles . <p> Part of the challenge for financial investigators , he said , is that in most cases , these assets are registered jointly or solely in the names of relatives or associates . <p> " When they do that , it becomes extremely difficult to prove that they own the assets , " Darien said . <p> " Because they are stealing cash and passing the cash to persons who , in turn , make the purchases , you wo n't have any paper trail to show that monies flowed from the victim 's account directly to the vendor , " he added . <p> In more sophisticated cases , the FID principal director said , shell companies registered outside of Jamaica are used to hold assets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone accused of involving in small arms trafficking owning properties in Jamaica and using a shell company established elsewhere to own that property , " he said . <p> " We are looking at other cases involving the use of that technique . " <p> But Darien said as part of the efforts to stamp out this practice , the Companies Act is to be amended to mandate full disclosure of the " beneficial owners " of a foreign entity seeking to set up shop in Jamaica . <p> " So where you have multiple layers of companies involved -- Company A is owned by Company B , Company B is owned by Company C -- if you are registering Company A in Jamaica , it will no longer be sufficient to say it is owned by Company B , " he explained . <p> " The rules that will be promulgated under the new Companies Act will want to know the individuals that are ultimately behind these companies .

In fact , the current attention on ChatGPT ( chat generative pre-trained transformer ) is an opportunity for Jamaica to consider how it may adopt , and adapt , the latest generations of AI technologies for use in the country 's development . <p> Artificial intelligence is at the cutting edge of the Fourth Industrial Revolution , which , a year or two ago , was incessantly part of the lexicon of Prime Minister Andrew Holness . Jamaica has to work hard to catch up and grasp these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warned . <p> Many of these technologies have industrial applications . But fundamentally , it is about the capacity of machines to take on and execute tasks not only with precision , but with human-like characteristics that make them exciting The best of them have the capacity to ' learn ' , thereby consistently improving their ability to perform their jobs and the possibility of opening new frontiers . <p> Recently , for instance , a big concern was over the AI application called Stable Diffusion . It collects , collates and analyses images from across the Internet , which it applies to help it fashion art in styles that mimic artists whose work it surveyed . A development of this type raises questions about the rights of the people whose creative efforts and economic well-being may be compromised , which is why there is discussion in the United States about the regulatory environment within which such a technology should exist . <p> ChatGPT , developed by a US company called OpenAI and launched last November , raises even more profound and complex questions . <p> Artificial intelligence systems that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are those that write poetry , prose or other narratives with seeming human sentiences . What makes ChatGPT different is the consistent sophistication and fluidity with which it engages the topics on which it is asked to espouse . <p> Moreover , it is easy to use . And it is still learning . So , the more it interfaces with its clients , its engagements will produce fewer errors and are likely to become deeper and more nuanced . <h> HARNESSING TECHNOLOGIES <p> Understandably , educators worry that students can use a program like ChatGPT to leapfrog academic effort and cheat their way to high grades and undeserved degrees and accolades . Those , indeed , are dangers . But they are only one side of the coin . <p> On the other is the possibility , too , of harnessing technologies like these for teaching and learning to enhance educational outcomes . That would be of value to Jamaica . <p> In any event , these technologies are not going away . Others of the kind , even improved , are on the near horizon . Banning them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , must be in their approaches to pedagogy and assessment to preserve the integrity of education outcomes . <p> Indeed , as ChatGPT said when asked by this newspaper whether it should be banned by Jamaica 's education authorities : " The decision to ban or restrict access to ChatGPT in educational settings should be based on a careful and informed consideration of the potential benefits and risks , and should take into account the views of students , teachers , parents , and other stakeholders . " <p> But any such consideration should not merely be about ChatGPT . Rather , Prime Minister Holness should establish a broad-based task force on artificial intelligence and its potential for driving Jamaica 's development in the short , medium and long term . Part of this effort should be an addendum to Orlando Patterson 's report on reforming Jamaica 's education system , including how AI might interface with advancing skills and vocational training .

Their independence came at a time when most of their neighbours were still slave territories and colonies . This could be considered their first disadvantage . Allies were few , if any .

From 1822-1844 , under Haitian President Jean-Pierre Boyer , the island of Hispaniola was unified . That was unsuccessful and in a war of independence , Santo Domingo gained its independence from Haiti becoming the Dominican Republic . <p> The fifth disadvantage has been poor , unstable leadership .

@@96951232 <h> Barbara CarbyNo to proposed increase in allowable noise levels <p> The National Environment and Planning Agency ( NEPA ) has in limited circulation a presentation titled ' Review of the Draft Noise Planning Policy Guidelines ( NPPG ) ' . The presentation contains suggestions for consideration and decision by the Town and Country Planning Authority/National Resources Conservation Authority ( NRCA ) boards . <p> Citizens ' Rights to the City , a network of citizen associations and individuals of 29 communities , primarily in Kingston and St Andrew , had sight of the presentation and strongly objects to an increase to 90 decibels ( dB ) as a new limit for construction sites . The proposed 90dB would be a level that is well above the 70-75dB recommended by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) in its 1999 publication , Guidelines for Community Noise . <p> The potential effects of noise on human health that are outlined in the WHO guidelines include hearing impairment from prolonged exposure and sleep disturbance , resulting in fatigue , depressed mood and decreased performance . For a good night 's sleep , the WHO guidelines recommend background noise below 30dB and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affect performance of more complex cognitive tasks , particularly in children . <p> There is also concern that levels above 80dB may lead to a decrease in people 's helping behaviour and an increase in aggressive behaviour , a possibility we do not need in Jamaica . <h> Headlines Delivered to Your Inbox <p> Long-term exposure to noise may lead to permanent physiological damage . The WHO recommends that for noise guidelines , special consideration should be given to vulnerable groups , such as people with diseases or medical problems , in hospitals or rehabilitating at home , people dealing with complex cognitive tasks , the blind , foetuses , babies , young children and the elderly . <p> The recommendation for residential areas heavily polluted with noise is that the total adverse health impact of noise over a 24-hour period be considered and the precautionary principle be applied . <p> In considering the proposed 90dB noise allowance for construction sites , the following should also be taken into account : <p> Negative impacts on hearing start in the 85-90dB range , especially with continuous exposure . This has implications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NPPG , the Bureau of Standards recommends that mitigation measures be put in place for noise at 90dB over one or two hours . This would apply to construction workers , who should be given hearing protection . However , occupants of nearby residences would be exposed without any protection . <h> The trend of replacing single-family dwellings with large , multi-storey buildings means that many residences are in close proximity to construction sites , with little attenuation of noise . People at home during the day will likely be among the vulnerable - the elderly , children , babies , the ill and those recovering from illness . They will be exposed to construction noise continuously throughout the day . <p> Many construction sites are going beyond the currently allowable time limits , with noise , including heavy equipment noise , from early morning until well into the night on weekends , including Sundays and on public holidays . It is therefore alarming that in NEPA 's review of the draft NPPG , there is a proposal to extend allowable hours of work on construction sites to 10 p.m. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some residential areas work on construction sites now continues until midnight without any intervention from the authorities , there is no confidence in the willingness or ability of the State to enforce the " indoor , quiet work " stipulation made in the recommendation for extension of working hours . <p> The proposed change would likely only codify into policy what are now egregious breaches of relevant laws , and a source of distress for residents of communities . The proposed change could have the effect of diminishing the rights of citizens living in close proximity to construction sites to the peaceful enjoyment of their homes . The recommendation also seems to conflict with citizens ' right to a healthy environment , which is guaranteed in Article 13(3) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms in Jamaica 's Constitution . This constitutional provision guarantees to all persons in Jamaica the right to " enjoy a healthy and productive environment free from the threat of injury or damage from environmental abuse ... " . <p> Construction sites are but one of many sources of environmental threat from noise pollution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may also be exposed to loud noise from entertainment , traffic and other sources . The potential cumulative effect is a highly adverse health load . <p> The matter of acceptable noise levels for national policy and legislation should be the subject of broad public discussion and agreement . It is crucial that NEPA facilitates such broad consultation as part of the decision-making process on the matters outlined in the draft NPPG . The agency must take steps to engage communities ; representative groups , including vulnerable populations such as seniors ; relevant professionals , including the medical fraternity ; and allied professionals such as audiologists . <h> RECOMMENDATIONS <h> Some of the recommendations in the review document are noteworthy for support , including the conservative limits proposed by the UWI et al , which are in line with WHO guidelines , as well as recommendations for : <p> * The incorporation of more stringent conditions related to noise in the permit and licences conditions and planning permissions issued by NEPA . <p> * More rigid monitoring and enforcement of standards and conditions related to <p> noise . <p> * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the <p> policy guideline/plan-making process . <p> * The use of citizens and technological means to monitor noise levels , such as citizen noise groups , drones , and a noise quality network . <p> We also propose that the Government fund research by academic institutions on noise pollution and its impact on mental and physical health and the general well-being of citizens .

It was designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Support Staff . <p> Rationale <p> Traditionally , the Jamaica Defence Force 's ( JDF ) longstanding partnerships with militaries across the world has seen its OCdts being trained in academies in the following countries : United States , England , Canada , China and India . Upon the return of OCdts to the JDF , there is a requirement for doctrine and operating procedure standardization due to the varying concepts and differing contents of the training they had undergone . This is normally done at the Unit level and later , through a Young Officers ' Course . The advent of COVID-19 added a new level of complexity to travel , thus negatively affecting the process of sending OCdts overseas . Additionally , the ongoing expansion and restructuring of the Force to cauterize the ballooning threats to national security has caused an increased demand for newly commissioned Second Lieutenants . <p> Due to the carefully adapted military and academic curricula , IOTP serves as the course to treat with the aforementioned considerations .

The course focusses on developing military skills and command with a leadership ' golden thread ' . The course structure allows the Instructing Staff to educate , build , develop and scrutinize an OCdt 's ability to decide and communicate accurately and ethically while under pressure and or stress . The expectation is that on commissioning , an OCdt will be fully cognizant of the responsibilities and personal conditions that being an Officer imposes upon them . The product of the IOTP will be an ethical and robust Officer who has the knowledge , skills , attitudes and intellectual agility to adapt their decision-making process and approach to any environment . <p> Location <p> The home of IOTP is the Caribbean Military Academy ( CMA ) Newcastle , which is located at the Newcastle Hill Station , St Andrew , Jamaica . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and amidst beautiful trees , ferns , ground orchids , delicate wild flowers and a profusion of ginger lilies , is the Newcastle <p> Training Depot founded in 1841 by Major General Sir William Maynard Gomm ( later Field Marshall ) .

So far , the gripings , innuendoes , calumny and smatterings of real issues against the IC have taken place behind the backs of the commissioners at sessions of a joint parliamentary committee reviewing the Integrity Commission Act and meetings of the House oversight group commission , where Executive Director Mr Christie has largely been the one who has fielded questions . <h> Headlines Delivered to Your Inbox <p> Two things have emerged from these meetings , especially the most recent ones : there is a deep hostility towards the commission , especially among the government side of the Gordon House claques ; and great ignorance , real or feigned , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even among members of Mr Bartlett 's committee . That is a shortcoming that needs urgent attention . <p> Some of the matters that have arisen at that committee demand the presence and the authority of the full commission or its chair . <p> Further , it is painfully obvious that Everald Warmington , the notoriously rude governing party gadfly , ought n't to be a member of the oversight committee , unless he is there to be a deliberately disruptive force rather than to make serious contributions . Prime Minister Holness should have him removed . <p> The assault on the commission has become increasingly aggressive since its clumsy handling in February of a report into the award of contracts more than a decade ago to a friend and business partner of Prime Minister Holness . At the time Mr Holness was the education minister . <p> The IC 's director of investigation concluded that with respect to two contracts for work in Mr Holness ' constituency , he influenced their award to his friend 's company .

It was followed the next day by the prosecutor 's ruling that charges against Mr Holness would n't be sustainable . <h> BETTER HANDLED <p> Notwithstanding the IC 's insistence that the peculiarity of law required the sequential publication of the documents , this newspaper holds that the matter could have been better and more creatively handled .

Further , he proposes the removal of privilege from IC 's reports , thereby stripping the immunity from defamation enjoyed by the commissioners , the authors of the documents , and anyone who publishes or quotes from them .

We have a punitive concept of law and confuse vengeance with justice . Again , human rights are values in their own right . Given our history , the values of individual freedom are deeply ingrained . But we also have traditions of authoritarianism which threaten these hard-won freedoms . <p> The point of transforming our production systems is not to develop a materialistic society in which a minority enjoys ' prosperity ' and represses the majority . It is to free people from the daily hustle for basic necessities so that we can develop our better selves , with individuals enjoying the highest respect , whatever their colour , class , gender or sexual orientation . Tech transformation is utterly pointless if , in the process , these central values become sidelined in the name of ' discipline ' or ' law and order ' or any other such canard .

Our larger firms are medium-size by global standards and have a vital role to play in this area . Yet it 's striking how many are diversifying away from Jamaica . This ' diversification ' is more like decoupling . They ' link up ' to global value-chains but do n't ' link back ' to transform our own technological landscape in Jamaica . In so far as there is any innovativeness in their operations , these remain located outside of Jamaica . So , in addition to premature de-industrialisation we may also be experiencing ' premature decoupling ' . <p> Large firms need to be incentivised by government to do research and development ( R&amp;D ) in Jamaica so that we get the benefit of the value-added and strengthen our domestic tech capacity .

' <h> WEAK R&amp;D INFRASTRUCTURE <p> Jamaica and the Caribbean have a weak R&amp;D infrastructure . We must develop a strong one . The tertiary system needs to be approached strategically as a single integrated intellectual ecosystem with relatively specialised roles for University of Technology ( UTech ) , The University of the West Indies ( UWI ) , Northern Caribbean and other private institutions . There must be collaboration across institutional boundaries in particular interdisciplinary fields . We do not have the luxury of having standalone tertiary silos . <p> The UWI needs to do more basic research linked to the Scientific Research Council , with UTech more on the applied side . Both should be hubs for interdisciplinary research centres with close linkages to each other and to firms and the production process . <p> UTech MUST return to its original mission but even that wo n't be enough . It should be a centre for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions . All tertiary institutions must also ' link back ' to high schools ( especially our technical high schools ) which in turn should link with our primary schools and work with them to raise standards up and down the ecosystem . Northern Caribbean is already doing some of this with HEART programmes . We need to seriously consider developing a mass programme of skill upgrading -- a kind of JAMAL-HEART -- in which we try to upgrade the skills of hundreds of thousands of Jamaicans , including the thousands in the informal sector , in a relatively short period of time . <p> These measures which I am proposing will take time to bear fruit . We should n't fool ourselves that it will be easy as the decline in technical knowledge in the society has been broad and deep . But if pursued consistently and with determination they will offer us the chance to break out of our current stagnation . <p> n Don Robotham is professor of anthropology and founding director of the advanced research collaborative of the graduate centre , City University of New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research at UWI .

( 11:2 ) . <p> And the powerful argument thatinformed this decision includes the huge cost to the health sector , the increase in poverty when the breadwinner is injured or dies , and the ravaging of a country 's gross domestic product ( GDP ) by between two per cent and five per cent . <p> In the ' Cost of Care Study : The Burden of Violence Related Injuries and Road Traffic Crashes ' ( which needs to be updated ) , done in Jamaica in 2014 , at seven hospitals , the direct and indirect cost to the country was estimated to be $3.2 billion , with the direct cost of road traffic crashes coming out at eight per cent of the Hospital Budget . <h> Headlines Delivered to Your Inbox <p> It is significant to note here that in 2013 , the effective year under review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the figure was 488 , and projections from our expert analysts point to 470 for 2023 , making it still a very bad year . <p> Clearly , the quantum of the budget allocated to hospital care would have increased since then , but by 60 per cent , I would doubt it . And with 99 road deaths for 2023 , despite a promising start , versus 123 ( January to March ) for 2022 , we are , unless something dramatic happens , heading right back to another disastrous year of grief and pain , a significant loss to the workforce , ravaging of the health care budget and GDP , and long-term retardation of our country 's national development . <h> THE SAFE SYSTEMS APPROACH <p> The question then arises : What strategic measure can be instituted to make a dramatic change , or even a slowing down , of the effects of this , virtually and metaphorically , " runaway train " of road traffic injuries and deaths ? There is only one such tried-and-proven policy directive , and another one , which each country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directive is the Safe Systems Approach to reducing road traffic injuries recommended by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) . It is a policy that has been endorsed by the chairman of the National Road Safety Council , the Most Hon. Andrew Holness , prime minister of Jamaica , a chairman who has given of his time and energy to , with authority , address the international community on this vitally important issue , repeatedly , when so invited . <p> This strategic and systemic approach to this now pervasive international problem is supported by research carried out by many nations that have successfully employed it to reduce road traffic injuries . <p> It has five main pillars - Safe Speeds , Safe Roads , Safe Road Users , Safe Vehicles , and An Efficient Post-crash Response -- that can extract victims quickly and safely and transport them to a hospital that is capable of treating injuries successfully . <p> The New Road Traffic Act , together with an improved ticketing system , both of which consumed much of the time and energy of the National Road Safety Council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , and across administrations , form part of the essential ecosystem necessary to produce Safe Speeds and Safe Road Users . <p> We have much more to accomplish , but recent events constituted a significant step in extracting as much as possible from these two aspects of the Safe Systems Approach . For example , the now legally possible use of cameras for electronic enforcement and the sending of tickets when brought on board later this year , as promised , would be a major step in this regard . <p> So , too , is the review of the breathalyser programme to make it more efficient so that the experience in other jurisdictions , where up to 30 per cent of drivers involved in fatal crashes were found to be driving under the influence of alcohol , can be replicated in Jamaica and dealt with by a more aggressive use of this instrument . <p> And we can not overstate the critical importance of dealing effectively with distracted driving caused by the use of cell phones without the use of a hands-free instrument , and texting and driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes for the provision that mandates the use of seatbelts in the front and rear of the vehicle and the use of a child restraint system in private motor cars . <h> MINIMUM THREE-STAR QUALITY ROADS <p> Next in line will be the equally important issue of lobbying that attention be given to the provision Safe Roads . And the WHO has a very specific requirement , namely , that nations ought to aim to build out a road network that has at the very minimum three-star quality roads , with five being the highest and one the lowest and unacceptable in respect of road safety . <p> The importance of this recommendation , which is the mandate of the FIA Foundation-funded iRAP ( International Road Assessment Program ) , is fully captured in this quote from them : " Broadly speaking , every extra star rating results in a halving of crash cost in terms of the number of people who are killed and seriously injured . " <p> Transporting goods and services and people is a huge contributor to our GDP , hence the absolute need to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In fact , at one time , not sure if it is still a requirement , the World Bank mandated that 10 per cent of the cost of building roads should be set aside for ensuring safe roads . This includes of bike lanes , pedestrian refuge areas , proper street lighting , road markings and cat 's eyes , the presence of sidewalks -- often absent in rural areas . <p> This has been a topic under discussion recently as a result of multiple fatalities on the Winston Jones Highway in Manchester and aspects of the North Coast highways -- some of which are reportedly slippery , especially when wet -- and where many fatal crashes have occurred . In context then , the announcement of the multibillion project , over a three-year span , to provide resources to upgrade and construct new roads is a welcome one . <h> SAFER VEHICLES <p> The issue of Safe Vehicles is a hot topic in many countries . And we in Jamaica ought to be very aware of significant improvements that have taken place in the manufacturing of motor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more for the environment than for safety , also made changes to how bonnets are built ; making them less lethal when a pedestrian is hit . <p> Improvements in the structure of the vehicle in respect of side impact and the high tech , for bikes and cars , ESC ( electronic stability control ) , assist in stabilising the car and bike when taking sudden and evasive action . An improvement that has saved many lives worldwide . Especially motorcyclists ! <p> Airbags are now pretty much standard equipment for new cars , but because a significant part of our imports are used vehicles , and more importantly , used vehicles for the public transportation system , we need to ensure that these vehicles meet the safety standards . <p> And again , like Safe Roads , safety is measured by stars based on crash testing , the results of which ought to be available to local authorities . This from regional new-car assessment programmes ( NCAP ) or international ones . <h> AN EFFICIENT POST CRASH SYSTEM <p> Finally , the issue of ensuring that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all accept given often chaotic scenes we witness on television when a crash occurs . <p> What else ? Providing the increased capacity , dedicated funding , a board of management and additional personnel for the UN-designated " lead agency " , which is the Secretariat of the National Road Safety Council -- an organisation that works closely with all other agencies , public and private , to promote road safety in Jamaica . Matters have been placed on the table for discussion for years , and across administrations , but are yet to be properly addressed . <p> So that is the policy directive in part , not in full , as such an in-depth analysis is beyond the scope of this article . <h> ' TIME COME ' <p> The second issue is the galvanising of the entire " village " to bring up children and produce adults who drive with extreme care and obey the traffic laws , routinely and not because of enforcement alone . This , aside from the fact that we do n't have the resources to have a policeman on every corner or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ network , is the only way to ensure that driving safely is built into our psyche and our culture . <p> Thus the Church , the social media influencers -- like Julie Mango , et al , ( payback time for those who know the story ) -- the ' keepers ' of our culture , the private-sector leaders , the teachers and all the professionals , the media , the youths , the police in and out of uniform , the musicians ( from Ding Dong to Chronixx , from Spice to Ifrica ) , together with the politicians , on both sides , and so many other groups , need to come on board this " road safety train " as the very outspoken and loquacious Mr Hare from the Island Traffic Authority terms it . <p> ' Time come ' for island-wide sustainable action ! <p> ' Time come ' to combat the effects that road traffic injuries and deaths are having on our national development . <p> - Dr Lucien W.

@@97918235 <h> Alfred Dawes A new world order <p> While we squabble about racist terms and double downs versus apologies , a major shake-up in the balance of power in the world is taking place . Since World War II , the world reserve currency has been in the United States dollar , or as it is called , the petrodollar . <p> In the post-World War II era , shifting power centres saw the ascension of the US as the leading global superpower . Reconstruction loans to European countries were denominated in US dollars and with the breakup of the British empire , it was not the Pound Sterling , but the US dollar that was used as a primary instrument of trade . International trade revolved around the dollar , and with the global financial institutions , the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) firmly under the control of NATO allies , a new world order was born . <p> That post-war US dollar was backed by gold reserves . A printed a dollar was linked to a set amount of gold , limiting its supply and fixing its value to that of gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough for other countries to use as their own currency , or having their local currency pegged to it . As Saudi Arabia and other oil-producing gulf countries grew in influence with the world 's addiction to fossil fuels , an agreement was made that cemented the dollar as the primary global instrument of trade . The US guaranteed their security in a tumultuous Middle East , in exchange for the exclusive use of the dollar in oil transactions . Thus , the petrodollar was born . <h> HEGEMONY <p> The dollar 's hegemony over global trade meant that when an increased supply was needed to finance the Vietnam War , there was little resistance to the removal of the gold standard by President Richard Nixon . With no link to gold , America was free to print as many dollars as it needed to cover its debts . Whether through financing its deficit in international trade , or filling a hole in the government 's budget , the petrodollar gives the US an extraordinarily privileged place in the world . As the US prints money at will , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dollar . As more dollars are printed , their value must fall as with any other fiat currency . Other less privileged countries could not escape economic instability of printing money to finance government spending . Argentina and Zimbabwe learned painful lessons in hyperinflation that are fresh in the memories of their citizens today . <p> That the dollar is still the reserve currency of the world , however , meant that this fate did not fall on the world 's largest economy . Well , until now . The increasing of the US money supply by almost 40% over the last three years has been linked to the massive inflation the world has experienced during that time . Local experts warned against the Bank of Jamaica , BOJ 's rapid and significant increases in interest rates , advising that our local inflation was imported , and not domestic demand driven . This imported inflation was initially caused by the large increase in the US money supply and increasing US consumer demands that led to global shortages and rising prices . This has been combated with the Federal Reserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise their rates in tandem . In other words , the US monetary and fiscal policies determine those of the world , especially vulnerable economies like ours . <h> Headlines Delivered to Your Inbox <h> GLOBAL NEGATIVE <p> The other global negative of having a dominant reserve currency is that of the application of sanctions on any country that falls out of line with US foreign policy . The inability to access the US dollar or the US banking system has left many an unfriendly government with economic instability and chaos . The threat of sanctions has kept many more countries in line . This petrodollar diplomacy with the big stick of the greatest military on earth , means the US effectively controls the world . The word on the street is that Gaddafi was overthrown and murdered because he was advocating for the gold-backed African dinar as a means of trade on the continent . This would have disrupted the influence of not only the dollar , but the CFA Franc in francophone countries that still used that currency controlled by the Bank of France . Similarly , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sell oil in Euros that led to his regime 's end and his hanging . <p> The US dollar has been under attack of late with the Chinese yuan being increasingly used to settle trade with its partners . Russia has started what it says is the complete removal of dollar denominated assets from its sovereign wealth fund and already the dollar 's share of global currency reserves has fallen from 72 per cent to less than 60 per cent in the last two decades . And now , in a move that has surprisingly not been carried much by Western media outlets , the BRICS countries are working on establishing a new reserve currency based on a basket of currencies from the five-nation bloc . At the same time there are discussions under way to increase BRICS membership to include former enemies Saudi Arabia and Iran , thus strengthening its position as a counterforce to the US-European hegemonic alliance . Central banks are also buying up gold and repatriating their gold reserves at a quickening pace as if to secure their currencies ' value in a post-petrodollar world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taylor Another race clout <p> On Wednesday last while hosting Radio Jamaica 's Hotline on 94 FM , I firmly responded to and dismissed a narrative coming from the mouth of the Bobo Rastafari elder , Jah Lloyd . ' Selassie I liveth everytime ! ' <p> It was perhaps the first time that I so stridently disagreed with him and I still do . In attempting to build an argument , consistent with the doctrine of repatriation , African sovereignty and the glorious culture of Africans , whether born on the continent or on ' I land ' , this island , he sought to establish that the building hosting the Houses of Parliament , Gordon House , was named after a non-black man , and in particular the son of a slave master . <p> A well-respected ' bredrin ' of mine reproached me that I was unreasonably harsh in my dismissal and in particular my refusal to let him build an argument on the premise that Gordon was somehow not part of the black race . <p> There was no intention to offend the Ras , and insofar as my comments and course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my stance , but for the possibility that he took offence . An important lesson we learn as members of a society is that even when we are right , and our actions and speech are not intended to be harmful , there can still be offence . Truth is , one can never measure the impact one 's actions , whether good or bad , may have on others . For this reason a ' Christ-ian ' approach always requires that we take the place of the other , when mediating our actions . <h> DEFEND THE STANCE <p> Let me make it clear here . I defend the stance I took , because Gordon for me is perhaps the greatest of our national heroes . Doubtless , in terms of international impact and the way that he has influenced black thought and civilisation since the 20th century , Marcus Garvey as a black man , ranks second only to Jesus as a man with hair of wool and skin of bronze . <h> Headlines Delivered to Your Inbox <p> Nonetheless Gordon , true , was born the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything that comes from the womb of a black woman can be nothing but black . Indeed , Among the Ashanti the traditional lineage , called abusua , is the matriline , because we are always sure who our mother is . In fact , we did not trace lineage so much via the ntoro , the paternal seed . Even outside of the context of an enslaved or post-slavery population like Jamaica where misplaced fatherhood is a major phenomenon , this makes perfect sense . <p> Therefore , to say that an African woman 's child is not African is totally disrespectful to our heritage and African identity itself . Mark you , there are persons who choose to emphasise or de-emphasise certain elements of their biological origin . This is why in sociology and anthropology we recognise that race actually does not exist , but insofar as we think that it does , it is a set of identifiable biological features which are considered to be relevant in a particular social or cultural context . <p> Race is a fluid category . My Chinese friend who has very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tournament in China . It certainly did n't help that he did n't speak Chinese , but he came back realising that they saw him as black . Half-Indians might be Indians in Jamaica but Douglas in Trinidad . And a reality check here . Even if you look white , the ' one drop ' rule makes you black if you are in Britain , Europe , the US or Australia . Gordon might have been seen by some Jamaicans as not completely black . But he identified with us , took our fight into the House of Representatives , cursed out the colonial governor on our behalf and ultimately was murdered by the colonial administration . <h> PICKED US <p> Unlike Sam Sharpe , Paul Bogle and Garvey who , like most of us , do n't show the minor non-black tinges in our blood , and therefore fought for themselves ; Gordon had a choice and he picked us . <p> If we go back to when and where scientists agree that homo sapiens emerged ; the irrefutable evidence and consensus is that we all emerged from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they rose from the dust in the horn of Africa . There is little doubt , having followed the Human Genome Project over the past three decades , that even Missa Singh , Missa Chin and the Tainos , all made a long journey from Africa . <p> Still , the more recent arrivals would mean that we Jamaicans came mostly from Ghana . True , Ethiopia has great significance to me as a diaspora African . However , I was brought from Ghana , not Abyssinia <p> Thus , because I am ostensibly Ashanti and not Ethiopian , my standard for where I shall identify is West African ; not Ethiopian . <p> In Jamaica , with a black majority population , persons of mixed race often choose to identify with one over the other ; and he should be free to do so . However , when one , such as Gordon , took on a fight for his mother 's people and paid the ultimate sacrifice , no one should even try to besmirch his contribution . <p> So , in concluding , in a period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our political leaders , I apologise for roughing up the Ras .

" Many Christians also treat Easter more as a holiday than a holy day . Many are no longer aware that Easter has a season known as Eastertide , with 50 days leading to Pentecost . " <p> The controversial and outspoken minister said that many Christians are not even aware that Ash Wednesday is so named because Christians traditionally start the season of Lent with ashes on their foreheads in the shape of a cross as a reminder of their mortality and the need for repentance . <h> Headlines Delivered to Your Inbox <p> " Many are just preoccupied with pointing out how others are sinners and declaring themselves as blessed and highly favoured , " said Major-Campbell . <p> On the other hand , Reverend Alvin Bailey , presiding bishop of the Holiness Christian Church in Jamaica , and Reverend Astor Carlyle , head of the Webster Memorial Church , believe that many Jamaicans still observe the religious part of the season . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we 'll never lose the significance , especially with so many churches per square mile , the increasing involvement of the church , and the many denominations in the life of Jamaica . <p> " The unprecedented unity of the church in advancing the Christian way of life , in particular , and its engagement in every aspect of the Jamaican society would have caused the church to increase the significance , and so those holidays and religious ceremonies and days like Easter will never lose significance to commercialisation or any other activity , " Bailey argued . <p> He added , however , that the local bun and cheese custom remains a significant part of the observation , but noted that it will not detract from the religious significance . <p> Carlyle expressed concerns that the emerging generations seem not to hold as firmly to some of the spiritual disciplines associated with these seasons , namely , fasting , dedicated periods of prayer , self-denial , corporate worship for Holy Week , etc . <p> Like Major-Campbell , he shared the view that more Jamaicans were moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Whereas reflection , worship , and quiet constituted these seasons -- especially Holy Week and Good Friday -- there seems to be a move for greater promotion of parties , events , and outings . <p> " It seems as if we are being primed to focus more on the existential matters of life than the eternal things of life , an unfortunate and dangerous imbalance , " Carlyle reasoned as he spoke with The Gleaner on Good Friday . <p> According to him , the Church has a responsibility to teach the society the value of rest , reflection , and seeking renewal through relationship with God in Christ Jesus . <p> " We need to teach the meaning behind these seasons so that persons can benefit from the balance that they offer to life , " he added . <p> Similarly , Major-Campbell said , " It is members who must share Christ 's light in a world with plenty of darkness .

So , by no means the tradition is lost or anywhere near being lost , " he said . <p> Bailey stressed that the Easter holiday period , which surrounds the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ , symbolises hope and redemption . <p> " The real hope for change , transformation to a life , to our society , to our community is in the provision of God 's redemptive grace and power that is possible in the life of humanity to bring newness and a difference to the life of many , " he said .

" <p> She thanked the Digicel Foundation for its partnership in executing the project . <p> " Through your foundation , you have shown your corporate responsibility in embracing the vision of education for all , and we thank you for the significant investment that you have made in supporting our schools island-wide , " she said . <p> " We are reinforcing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Education Ministry , but it 's actually a national project and so there is a place for everyone to be involved , " she noted . <p> Miss Smith encouraged parents to not put limitations on their special needs children . <p> " When you have a special child , it is easy to think that the possibilities are limited but this centre right here is going to show you otherwise , " she said . <p> Miss Smith said she is looking forward to the start of a Parent Place at the centre in September which , she noted , " will offer support to our parents as they journey with our children to developing into the humans they need to be , and of course , become independent and resilient . " <p> For her part , Acting Chief Education Officer , Dr. Kasan Troupe , noted that the Ministry is " not just about mainstreaming ; we are about every single Jamaican child , so our education system was developed to ensure that our child can transform their socio-economic reality and in doing so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> She noted that the school is a symbol of hope and transformation " and we are relying on every single partner to keep it alive , to keep it successful , to make it a brand and centre of excellence as it is designed to be .

" <p> Chief Executive Officer of the Digicel Foundation , Charmaine Daniels , for her part , said the centre serves as a symbol of inclusivity , acceptance and equal opportunity , offering a holistic approach to education . <p> She noted that it provides special instruction in a nurturing environment that will empower students to reach their full potential . <p> Students at the Santa Cruz Special Education Centre will be exposed to a curriculum for students with moderate to severe intellectual disabilities and a modified Grade 7 -- 9 National Standards Curriculum covering functional literacy , functional mathematics , life skills , social studies , civics , character education , resources and technology . <p> To support the transition nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training in agriculture science , basic food preparation , craft and d ? cor , business basics . <h> Change Language <p> Initial Officer Training Programme ( IOTP ) provides basic military officer training to Officer Cadets ( OCdts ) and their equivalents from law enforcement and uniformed services . The programme falls within the tactical level of the Professional Military Education ( PME ) framework of armed forces and is modelled from the Royal Military Academy Sandhursts ' ( RMAS ) Commissioning Course . It was designed with the direct support and guidance of RMAS Instructing and Support Staff . <p> Rationale <p> Traditionally , the Jamaica Defence Force 's ( JDF ) longstanding partnerships with militaries across the world has seen its OCdts being trained in academies in the following countries : United States , England , Canada , China and India . Upon the return of OCdts to the JDF , there is a requirement for doctrine and operating procedure standardization due to the varying concepts and differing contents of the training they had undergone . This is normally done at the Unit level and later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID-19 added a new level of complexity to travel , thus negatively affecting the process of sending OCdts overseas . Additionally , the ongoing expansion and restructuring of the Force to cauterize the ballooning threats to national security has caused an increased demand for newly commissioned Second Lieutenants . <p> Due to the carefully adapted military and academic curricula , IOTP serves as the course to treat with the aforementioned considerations . The methodology used addresses each issue directly and the course , through the delivery of a bespoke training syllabus , is fit for the JDF and is also relevant to the militaries and organizations within the Caribbean region and in other parts of the world . <p> Concept <p> Having the RMAS approach to training at its core , IOTP is designed with a syllabus that sees male and female integration throughout training . The course focusses on developing military skills and command with a leadership ' golden thread ' . The course structure allows the Instructing Staff to educate , build , develop and scrutinize an OCdt 's ability to decide and communicate accurately and ethically while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on commissioning , an OCdt will be fully cognizant of the responsibilities and personal conditions that being an Officer imposes upon them . The product of the IOTP will be an ethical and robust Officer who has the knowledge , skills , attitudes and intellectual agility to adapt their decision-making process and approach to any environment . <p> Location <p> The home of IOTP is the Caribbean Military Academy ( CMA ) Newcastle , which is located at the Newcastle Hill Station , St Andrew , Jamaica . <p> Nestled in the cool hills of upper St Andrew and amidst beautiful trees , ferns , ground orchids , delicate wild flowers and a profusion of ginger lilies , is the Newcastle <p> Training Depot founded in 1841 by Major General Sir William Maynard Gomm ( later Field Marshall ) . Gomm , a veteran of the wars against revolutionary France and Lieutenant Governor of Jamaica from 1840 to 1841 , relentlessly badgered the War Office in London to establish a mountain station for British soldiers in Jamaica soon after taking up his post . <p> The idea of the hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April 7 , 1840 to Governor Sir Charles Metcalfe . Gomm pointed out that while Up Park Camp was an ideal location for a barracks , it was subject to the ravages of yellow fever . In Jamaica the <p> British garrison was stationed on the plain at Up Park Camp , Stony Hill , Fort Augusta and Port Royal . Here , on the average , 1 soldier died every 2 ? days . According to Russell , the year 1838 was considered a ' good ' year : only 91 men died . In 1839 , 110 men perished and in the following year 121 . Initially , the British government was conservative in approving a hill station for the troops in Jamaica . They were concerned about the expense of the venture . <p> In May 1841 , London finally sanctioned Gomm 's efforts to build what is thought to be the first permanent mountain station in the British West Indies at Newcastle . The site selected was a coffee plantation protruding from the southern face of the grand ridge of the Blue Mountains . The British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the outbreak of World War II ( 1939-1945 ) , life at Newcastle changed a little . The British regiment was replaced by Canadian regiments which remained at Newcastle for the duration of the war . With hostilities over in 1945 , the Canadians left and once again a British battalion was stationed there . <p> In 1958 , the West Indies Federation was founded and the infantry regiments of the various Caribbean islands were disbanded and reorganized into the West India Regiment . Newcastle became a training depot , training recruits from all over the West Indies as part of the <p> newly formed West Indies Federation . In 1962 when Federation was disbanded , the West India Regiment was also disbanded . Jamaica simultaneously sought her independence , which was achieved on August 6 , 1962 . With independence , Newcastle was given to the Jamaican government as part of a general settlement of all military lands in Jamaica .

The StJMC had previously announced that Montego Bay would be recognised as ' Sumfest City ' , with advertisers to promote that slogan from May 31 to July 23 . <h> ENTERTAINMENT ZONE <p> On the matter of Montego Bay as an entertainment hub , Ellis recommended that a structured entertainment zone should be established in Montego Bay in order to better secure the safety of patrons at social events . <p> " Suggestions have been made that we should look at something like an entertainment zone , because the entertainment aspect of things is very important . We are having the enhanced security measures , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen where , in other parishes , other major events are taking place and persons are being injured , " said Ellis . <p> " We are growing as a destination , the demand is there for it , and we should look at how security features can contend with what the people actually want , " Ellis added . <p> " You can not have these events thrown all over the place in the middle of some battle zones and in places where everybody wants to be going at each other , " he stated . " I think we should look at this zone as the future of the St James division .
