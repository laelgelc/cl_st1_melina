Globally if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say Bangladesh is probably second to India in terms of innovation . It made sense for the UN Technology Bank to tap into and see how we can leverage this experience to help other LDCs . <p> Our objective is to use the Bangladeshi experience of building networks to build networks between Bangladesh and the rest of the LDCs and between the LDCs and the rest of the global startup communities . In that case , we will have an excellent chance of ensuring that the full potential for innovation in the LDCs is realized . <p> Another point to consider , and this is also why financial inclusion is essential , is that Bangladesh has a vibrant history of micro-credit and micro-finance . This experience is very critical because when we look at the makeup of economies in most developing countries , if not all and particularly the LDCs , they are over 90% driven by SMEs . So , if we can innovate around enhancing access to finance for startups , access to finance for SMEs , they have a better chance of succeeding . It also offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of supporting startups . <p> On innovation and startups , Bangladesh is the right place to start . We are currently finalizing plans to initiate discussions with Qatar , Bangladesh , and Rwanda . Our intention is to establish a regional hub for innovation in Dhaka , Bangladesh , which will serve all LDCs in the Asia-Pacific region for precisely the same reasons as stated before . Bangladesh has a robust , viable , and active startup community , the right ecosystem , and a government fully committed to supporting innovation and startups . There are important lessons we can draw from this and locating the regional hub in Bangladesh is the right way to go about it . <p> What goals would you like to achieve from the startup competition in this area in Bangladesh ? <p> Our main objective is to use the SDG Impact Accelerator ( SDGia ) initiative to energize and support startups in LDCs . We will use this platform to encourage more startups and provide them with the initial support of $15,000 , which allows them to innovate around local challenges . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ startups to innovate around local problems rather than bring a startup or innovator from another part of the world to innovate for local solutions in Bangladesh . <p> We hope that the startup that will be awarded or selected will be a startup in Bangladesh because that means we would have succeeded in using this initiative to boost local innovation and use it to engage with local startups even beyond the SDGia call . <p> We want to use this to build a very vibrant engagement with the startup community in Bangladesh . We have already held discussions with , for example , the " Startup Bangladesh , " which is a very strong government initiative to support startups in Bangladesh . Our idea is to build partnerships that will help startups . We want to use this opportunity to engage and provide direct support to startups , and this is the main goal that we want to achieve with the SDGia call . <p> Can you please provide us with the outcome of previous SDGia activities ? <p> The first phase of the SDGia initiative was in Turkey and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the biggest host country for refugees globally , mainly from Syria and from other parts of the world . To better facilitate refugees ' integration in the local communities , the SDGia program was used as a platform in which innovations around certain challenges that were affecting the refugee communities could be pursued and realized . One such solution involved sanitation . <p> Through the SDGia program , Turkey was able to launch a call for innovations that would help address the sanitation issue . A startup identified a solution , which eased and reduced challenges that refugee communities were facing on matters related to sanitation . <p> As Bangladesh is at the final stage of transition from an LDC to a developing country , what 's the prospect for Bangladesh to get more cooperation and assistance from the UN Tech Bank in the future ? <p> The UN Technology Bank as part of the UN system and the broader group of development partners for Bangladesh is committed to supporting Bangladesh in its successful transition out of the LDC category and to provide this level of support or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our support for Bangladesh will not end with its graduation . This continued support is very important for sustainability . <p> We will continue to support Bangladesh for a minimum of five years . It is crucial that once Bangladesh graduates , it does not slide back into the LDC category . In this sense , it would be a missed opportunity to withdraw our support for Bangladesh immediately after its graduation . It will continue until we are satisfied that it is well and good on its solid ground and is a middle-income country . <p> As Bangladesh is at the final stage of transition from an LDC to a developing country , what 's the prospect for Bangladesh to get more cooperation and assistance from the UN Tech Bank in the future ? <p> The UN Technology Bank as part of the UN system and the broader group of development partners for Bangladesh is committed to supporting Bangladesh in its successful transition out of the LDC category and to provide this level of support or even increase it for the first five years after its graduation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

@@52476237 <h> Bangladesh in 2050 : Vision of a climate resilient society <p> What will Bangladesh look like in 2050 ? A layman 's projection allows us to draw a picture of its basic parameters . In terms of population , Bangladesh can reach a number of 230-240 million , with an average growth rate of 1.2 percent/year . The density of population will be around 1700/sq.km , the highest ever in the world . Considering a consistent economic growth rate of 8 percent/year , the size of our economy , i.e. GDP will be more than three times larger -- this means from its current volume of about USD 270 billion , it will shoot up to USD 2.5 trillion in 2050 . This will give a per capita GDP of over USD 12,000 in current prices . So , the vision of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina will come true by 2041 -- a developed Bangladesh . <p> Can such an uninterrupted trajectory of rapid growth be ensured , while maintaining environmental sustainability ? This is a hard question to answer . We already see not a single drop of fresh water in Bangladesh 's rivers and canals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen when the size of the economy trebles in the next three decades ? Based on global experience , we must say that Bangladesh can not afford to traverse the trajectory of environmental Kuznet 's curve , with bending the pollution curve after the now rich countries have reached a per capita income of 5-6 thousand US dollars . Ours is a small sized country with unprecedented biotic pressure , both from poverty and rapid economic growth on very limited natural resources . <p> So , we have to proceed with a strategy simultaneously of growth , equity and environmental protection , not growth first and environment later . We actually need more of development -- an improvement in quality of people 's lives , not just growth -- a physical expansion of the economy , which not always leads to development . The case of Dhaka city is an example . We must have the vision of liveable cities in Bangladesh by 2050 . Then comes the main challenge of the day -- the increasingly frequent climate events like floods , cyclones , tidal surge , sea-level rise and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The world has already crossed the one-degree temperature rise , compared to the pre-industrial level . For all practical purposes , the world can not meet the aspirational target of maximum rise of 1.50 degrees Celsius agreed under the Paris Agreement . According to IPCC report ( 2018 ) , global greenhouse gas emissions will need to be halved by 2030 and reach net zero by mid-century in order to have a good chance of holding temperature increase to 1.5 degrees C. Against this , there are estimates that given 100 percent compliance of the submitted NDC pledges of emissions reduction , the world will witness a rise of over 30C . And this is the average . <p> In tropical countries of Africa and Asia including in Bangladesh , the rise is likely to be more than the global average . Already extreme climate events with its higher frequency and severity have become the " new normal " . In this unfolding scenario , Bangladesh is recognised globally as one of the most vulnerable countries in the world . There is yet no authoritative national assessment of loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for adaptation and mitigation investments . However , a number of multilateral development agencies , few international think tanks and the Bangladesh government have many different cost estimations -- both current and future , which cover economy-wide , sectoral and disaster type-based climate impacts . The estimated loss to GDP ranges from 0.5 to 2 percent by 2050 . Overall , total costs vary between USD 3 billion to USD 5 billion a year up by 2050 , while the investment needs for adaptation in agriculture sector and infrastructure range from USD 1 billion to USD 10 billion a year . <p> During the next three decades , absolute costs to the economy will go higher and higher . In such circumstances , can Bangladesh , with its sandwiched geographical location between the Himalayas in the North and Bay of Bengal in the South , aspire to be a climate resilient society by 2050 ? We believe it can , given a well-planned strategy that we follow with total commitment . <p> We may recall that the 2041 Perspective Plan relies on four institutional pillars to be harnessed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transformation . These are : ( i ) democratisation ; ii ) decentralisation ; iii ) governance ; and ( iv ) capacity building . In this short space , we will focus on three pillars , beginning with decentralisation , then governance and capacity building . <p> With prioritisation of climate change adaptation as a central strategy of development , Bangladesh is already a recognised leader globally in adaptation and resilience . The former UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon calls Bangladesh a " teacher " in adaptation for the global community to learn from . By taking over the leadership of the Climate Vulnerable Forum ( CVF ) for the next two years , Bangladesh has the opportunity to represent vulnerable countries at global forums like COP26 , to lead the South-South sharing of knowledge and experience and in adaptation among the vulnerable countries . In the era of Covid-19 , this provides Bangladesh the space to show both national and global leadership how to tackle the climate change emergency . Bangladesh has a solid record of decentralised , successful community-based disaster management , which is acclaimed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Dhaka can be a hub of excellence , as an effective platform in this regard . The <p> The centre will have a focus on locally led adaptation which has proven its efficacy in many developing countries . We have the vision of Switzerland , a country truly locally-led . <p> As adaptation is inherently locale and region-specific , the challenge is to change the current top-down paradigm of targeting vulnerable communities by governments as well as global funds and agencies , to a bottom-up approach . This will warrant an inclusion of the local communities in the design , implementation and monitoring of the adaptation support to make them more effective . For example , for handling the increasing number of climate migrants particularly from coastal areas , we can prepare a bottom-up plan for their relocation , to settle them , not in Dhaka , but in nearby towns and growth centres which can be made migrant-friendly , with basic services and facilities at affordable cost . The on-going preparation of the National Adaptation Plan led by the Ministry of Environment , Forests and Climate Change can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implementation in Bangladesh . Therefore , the most fundamental way for change is to consider the Bangladesh NAP as an investment , rather than a short time-bound project , initiated and implemented by central authorities . <p> Next comes the pillar of governance . A process of transparent and accountable governance is another key to our 2050 vision of a resilient Bangladesh . Here the primary focus should be on allocation of investments for addressing climate change , particularly for adaptation actions and its transparent governance . The government already has initiated a budget line dedicated to climate investment and this year 's budget has allocated an amount of almost USD 3 billion , which equals to almost 8 percent of our annual budget . This compares with a measly amount of average USD 300 million a year that our country gets as international support to address climate change . So the challenge is -- how to make the best use of these investments . Also mobilising international support from the Green Climate Fund and other sources , particularly the grant part of climate finance is important for Bangladesh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entail a decline in grant part of foreign aid that we get each year . We must remember based on evidence that international public support for adaptation flows not to the most vulnerable , but to countries with best fiduciary management systems . Similar is the case with foreign direct investment , a vital element for rapid economic growth in any developing country , which flows to regions with transparent business environment . <p> For mobilisation and allocation of climate finance , we must follow the principles , such as people 's vulnerability-and livelihood-centred approach , polluter-pays principle , revenue neutral way of environmental taxation for the government as well as for the citizens and private sector , decentralisation of allocation and mobilisation of climate finance , and a programmatic approach for implementation of the plans and strategies . <p> Though environmental sustainability is typically a public good , public investments alone will not suffice to effectively address climate change . So innovative and appropriate fiscal , financial and charge systems , in light of experiences in other countries have to be worked out . This could be tax/levy ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , subsidies , grants , revolving funds , equity , introduction of green bond , insurance , CSR funds , etc . The Climate Fiscal Framework of Bangladesh outlines some possibilities for climate finance for Bangladesh . This needs to be operationalised in earnest . <p> Finally , the most important pillar of realising our vision 2050 is capacity building at all levels . In fact , a whole of society approach is needed -- from awareness to education and skill development of all types , to research and development , with delineation of specific needs of skills , expertise and policy research for tackling climate change . Also achieving climate resilience will dictate that all kinds of professionals , lower and higher , must undergo basic training on how to tackle climate change , from perspective of each profession and trade . <p> Unfortunately , Bangladesh is not doing well in this regard . In terms of the Human Development Index , our country ranks lower than 150 countries . The productivity in the garment sector , our number one export earner and women 's employer , is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a poor position , as is demonstrated by the publication of last year 's Global Knowledge Index , where Bangladesh ranked 112th out of 138 countries -- we were the lowest ranked in South Asia , with India ranking the highest in our region . This does not augur well for our vision of a developed country in the next three decades . <p> While Bangladesh is regarded poor in terms of natural resources , we can be rich through harnessing huge demographic dividend , potentially waiting to be exploited . The 2041 plan specifies , among others , some strategies for this , such as : i ) Institution of a knowledge-based economy ; ii ) Population with 100 percent literacy rate ; iii ) Universal free education for up to 12 years ; iv ) job-oriented skill development in vocational and training institutions , etc . This will require much higher investment than is currently available , which is perhaps the lowest in South Asia in terms of the share of our budget . <p> We believe our single greatest national asset are our young girls and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educating them better , we can indeed transition to a significant knowledge-based economy within the next decade . However , this will require a national consensus for us to make the necessary paradigm shift . <p> Dr Saleemul Huq is Director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development at the Independent University , Bangladesh .

" We in the US have not seen this new energy toward cycling since Lance Armstrong won the Tour de France . " <p> Credit the coronavirus pandemic , which has ignited bike sales of all stripes , but none so much as e-bikes . While retail unit sales of bicycles from January to October last year were up 46 percent from a year earlier , electric bikes were up 140 percent . Measured in dollars , regular bikes were up 67 percent and e-bikes 158 percent -- so do n't expect a discount . Those numbers , from the market researchers at NPD , do not include online-only retailers such as Rad Power Bikes , so sales may actually be higher still . <p> Ogden Bolton aside , there is a historical connection between bicycles and motorcycles .

Many car companies , including Ford , Audi , Maserati and BMW , have gotten into and out of e-bikes since . <p> " No car company has had any success selling an electric bicycle , " said Don DiCostanzo , chief executive of Pedego Electric Bikes , who in 2014 licensed a bike design to Ford . " It 's fool 's gold . It can never replace the profit on a car . " <p> Yet car and motorcycle makers are being drawn in .

" <p> However , changes in the way people get about , especially in Europe and Asia , are enticing motor vehicle companies that operate internationally . Overseas , in cities that manage pollution and overcrowded streets by restricting motor traffic , e-bikes often fill a gap . <p> " In Europe , the e-bike is more of a fundamental transportation tool , " said Dirk Sorenson , an analyst for NPD . London , Madrid , Oslo and Paris are among the growing number of cities restricting downtown traffic . <p> The pandemic has American cities testing similar restrictions . Boston , Minneapolis and a number of California cities have instituted Slow Streets programs , restricting motor traffic on side streets in favor of cycling and walking .

" <p> Price is n't the only hurdle . E-bikes confront a crippling hodgepodge of laws . Although the Consumer Product Safety Commission deemed " low speed " e-bikes ( with a motor equivalent to 1 horsepower or less ) a bicycle , states still decide where that bike can be ridden . <p> " It 's up to 50 states to define the use , and that 's been a big problem in the past , " said Claudia Wasko , general manager of Bosch eBike , a prominent manufacturer of drive systems . <p> The PeopleForBikes coalition drafted model state legislation to allow most e-bikes in bike lanes and parks .

@@52700237 <h> The State of Research in Bangladesh <p> Lately , the world university ranking systems , especially promoted by the private universities for attracting prospective students in Bangladesh , have brought attention to the state of research in local universities . The quality of higher education in the country is also under the microscope . Historically , most of our universities were focused on offering quality undergraduate degrees . Only few of them had reasonably strong graduate programmes . Most of the newer universities struggle to start graduate studies and end up having a second-tier programme to justify calling themselves a university instead of a college . So , the culture of research never really took off . <p> Evaluating faculty members for review , promotion and tenure is a challenging job that has evolved with time . In the early eighties , effective teaching was considered the principal task of a faculty member . Now , it is necessary but not sufficient . More emphasis is given on strong research and publication over excellence in teaching and services . The Times Higher Education ranking started in 2004 and The QS University Ranking started in 2011 . It takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sustained efforts from all stakeholders to develop a healthy and active research culture . <p> To create new knowledge , develop new products and services , or improve the old ones for human benefit requires research . The onus of doing research is not only on the universities . In 2016 , the global industry spent 15 percent of its revenue on Research and Development ( R&amp;D ) . Both academia and industry need to cooperate and collaborate closely for the advancement of the civilisation . The Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine development is an example of such cooperation that led to a great success . <p> In Bangladesh , no one talks about professional or industry research because it almost does not exist . There are a few private think tanks , non-profits and NGOs that are doing research on socio-economic issues , and a few government agencies like BRRI , BARI , BIDS , AEC , BCSIR , etc. in other sectors . Industry R&amp;D in science , engineering and technology is non-existent . No one expects much basic research in a low-income country , but none of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conducts applied research to solve local problems . Most importantly , industries rarely approach universities to solve such problems . It implies that either they do n't have any problem , or it is solved by local/overseas consultants . <p> The majority of the published research in Bangladesh are conducted by university faculty members and students . The quality of every faculty position is ensured by setting up qualifications in terms of academic results , publications and experience . Outside teaching experience , the publication requirement for assistant professor , associate professor and professor positions increases with the hierarchy from a minimum of three to fifteen publications . The quality of these publications varies and is judged differently in different universities . Generally , very few can attain associate or full professorship without a PhD degree . <p> The principal driving force for university research in Bangladesh is to attain qualification for the next higher position that substantially diminishes once one becomes a full professor . Of course , there are a number of faculty members in every university at every level who perform and produce high-quality research work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The question that needs to be asked is why Bangladeshi university faculty members lack the motivation to do research . Is it dearth of money , facilities or something else ? After an extensive literature review , a study published in The Social Science journal in 2016 identified six motivating factors for faculty research : achievement , enjoyment , work itself , recognition , rewards and pressure . <p> The last three -- recognition , reward and pressure -- are in the hands of the institutes . An organisational research environment can be established with institutional and individual leadership along with proper training and support . The greater challenge in Bangladesh is ensuring achievement , enjoyment and the work itself . STEM research in developing countries frequently follows issues and problems of high-income countries -- especially in basic research -- that do not have any local relevance . Seeing one 's work that is locally relevant being applied , appreciated and making a difference in society gives one the highest feelings of achievement and joy . That is only possible if the universities have an active interaction with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry and the government will generally involve foreign firms and consultants to resolve the critical problems . Despite that indifference , both agriculture and public health research have flourished in Bangladesh due to local relevancy . <p> In other sectors , sometimes even worthwhile findings of local custom research are not followed through , making the faculty members frustrated . As a result , they fall into the trap of doing research helping high-income countries for publication purposes , or producing lower-quality unpublishable work for the sake of churning out degrees . Finding a good graduate student interested in higher studies and research is another major hurdle for most of the faculty members in all universities in Bangladesh . <p> Why would a student go to a graduate school after completing the bachelor 's degree ? The student would weigh the worth of the extra time and money needed for the higher degree . It is not an easy decision to make even for a good student . In my 25 years of teaching graduate programmes , I would ask every student one question : why are you here ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fulfilling parents ' wishes , switching subject for a better job prospect , and a platform for studying abroad , etc. are some of the answers I received . A vast majority just kept quiet . They simply did n't know what they were doing in the graduate programme . None of them ever told me that they were interested in research . To be fair to the students , some said they wanted to learn the subject , but these were mostly from the industry . This could be different in other streams . <p> Surveys among graduate students find many reasons why they want to pursue a higher degree . One dominant thread shows the expectation of getting an edge in the job market , long-term financial benefits , more responsibility at the job , and promotions . Unfortunately , none of these conditions exist in Bangladesh . Apart from universities and a few research institutes , no other job encourages or rewards a higher degree . Outside the universities , there are very few jobs that require a PhD degree . Once , professionals in all public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a graduate degree ( master 's or PhD ) . That practice has been abolished a long time ago . It seems the job market ( at least public sector ) is discouraging higher studies by design . Even the universities ( both public and private ) prefer overseas degrees for faculty recruitment , discarding candidates with a local graduate degree . The academically inclined students tend to go overseas when they see no job prospect or reward for having a higher degree in the country . <p> Not only do graduate students help the faculty carry out their research work , but it is also an inherent part of their training . Research allows a student to learn solving problems individually or in a team environment . Without good graduate students , faculty research will be completely handicapped . To attract students in higher studies and research , a good job market with appropriate responsibility and compensation must be created by both industry and the government . At the same time , the University Grants Commission has to ensure honesty and ethics in the pursuit of knowledge as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The creation of a conducive research culture in the country is a multi-stakeholder task . Leaving the responsibility to the universities only will never resolve the issue . <p> Dr. M.

It wasn t made clear at Thursday s motions hearing who originally sought the change . <p> Chauvin , who was seen in widely viewed bystander video pressing his knee into Floyd s neck as the Black man said he couldn t breathe , was convicted in April of second-degree unintentional murder , third-degree murder and manslaughter . He s to be sentenced June 25 . <p> During Thursday s hearing , attorneys for the defense argued that prosecutors should be sanctioned after media reports that Chauvin had planned to plead guilty a year ago .

The Associated Press published a similar report the next day , citing two law enforcement officials with direct knowledge of the talks . Paule alleged that the leaks came from the state , and asked that anyone who did so be barred from participating in the trial .

Paule claimed that he Hennepin County medical examiner , Dr. Mark Baker , was coerced to include neck compression in his findings and that prosecutors knew of it . <p> In a brief letter to Cahill , Frank said The bizarre allegations offered in support of the motion are false and wrong and we intend to file a complete response .

But after talking twice to Dr. Roger Mitchell a former medical examiner in Washington , D.C. he amended his findings to include neck compression as a factor , according to Paule . <p> Paule said that in one of the conversations , Mitchell called Baker and told him he was going to submit an opinion piece critical of Baker s findings to the Washington Post . When Baker released final autopsy findings June 1 , they included neck compression , Paule wrote , and Mitchell never submitted his piece to the newspaper . <p> Mitchell , now chairman of the Department of Pathology at the Howard University College of Medicine , did not respond to a phone message left at the department Wednesday . A spokeswoman for Baker said they could not comment due to the pending case . <p> Paule also took aim at Mitchell s criticism of Dr. David Fowler , a key defense witness for Chauvin who testified that the former officer was not responsible for Floyd s death .

China is at the center of Biden 's assertion that democracies are in an existential confrontation with autocracies . <p> " The democratic values that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and externally , " the president told reporters Monday evening after the summit meeting . " Russia and China are both seeking to drive a wedge in our trans-Atlantic solidarity . " <p> In its communiqu ? , negotiated by consensus from all 30 members , NATO is cautious in its characterization of China . <p> Russia is repeatedly described as a " threat " to NATO in the document , with criticisms of the buildup in Russian weaponry , its hacking and disinformation assaults on Western countries , the 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine , and other aggressive acts . <p> By contrast , China is described as presenting " challenges . " But those challenges are considerable . The NATO secretary-general , Jens Stoltenberg , has said China now has the second-largest military budget after the United States and the world 's largest navy . Beijing is strengthening its nuclear stockpile and developing more sophisticated missiles and ships . <p> " China is not our adversary , but the balance of power is shifting , ' ' Stoltenberg said Monday . " And China is coming closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see China in Africa , but we also see China investing heavily in our own critical infrastructure , " he said . " We need to respond together as an alliance . " <p> China has sent ships into the Mediterranean and through the Arctic ; it has also conducted military exercises with Russia in NATO 's backyard , built bases in Africa , and owns significant infrastructure in Europe , including the Greek port of Piraeus . <p> China 's army has hacked computers to steal industrial and military secrets all over the globe and engaged in disinformation in NATO societies . And with its effort to deploy 5G networks across Africa , the Middle East and Europe , Huawei , the Chinese telecommunications giant , has created new anxiety that it could control the communications infrastructure needed by NATO . <p> President Joe Biden , right , meets with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey , second from left , at NATO headquarters in Brussels on Monday , June 14 , 2021 . NATO leaders expressed a new concern about China 's growing military might , signaling a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protecting Europe and North America -- not Asia . ( Doug Mills/The New York Times ) <p> In a discussion of " multifaceted threats " and " systemic competition from assertive and authoritarian powers " in the communiqu ? , NATO says that " Russia 's aggressive actions constitute a threat to Euro-Atlantic security . " While China is not called a threat , NATO states that " China 's growing influence and international policies can present challenges that we need to address together as an alliance . " <p> NATO promised to " engage China with a view to defending the security interests of the alliance ' ' and said it planned to increase partnerships with more countries in the Indo-Pacific . <p> Much further into the document , China comes up again , described as presenting " systemic challenges " to the " rules-based international order . " <p> In a gesture toward diplomacy and engagement , the alliance vows to maintain " a constructive dialogue with China where possible , " including on the issue of climate change , and calls for China to become more transparent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrine . " <p> Chinese officials reacted sharply to the NATO communiqu ? , as they have to other statements from G-7 leaders made in the previous days . The alliance 's characterization of the challenges posed by China was " a slander of China 's peaceful development , a misjudgment of the international situation and its own role , and a continuation of the Cold War mentality , " the country 's mission to the European Union in Brussels said in a post on Weibo . <p> NATO leaders on Monday also agreed to spend next year updating the alliance 's 2010 strategic concept , which 11 years ago viewed Russia as a potential partner and never mentioned China . <p> New challenges from cyberwarfare , artificial intelligence and disinformation , as well as new missile and warhead technologies , must be considered to preserve deterrence , the alliance said . And Article 5 of its founding treaty -- an attack on one is an attack on all -- will be " clarified " to include threats to satellites in space and coordinated cyberattacks . <p> This NATO meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrast to his predecessor has expressed deep belief in the alliance and in the importance of American participation in the multilateral institutions Washington established after the horrors of World War II . <p> The contrast to Trump 's May 2017 NATO summit was remarked on by many other leaders . Then , Trump was particularly angered by the expense and lavish use of glass in NATO 's new $1.2 billion headquarters . Trump also defied the expectations of even his own aides and refused to announce support for NATO 's Article 5 , a central tenet of collective defense . <p> Biden quickly declared Monday that the alliance is " critically important for US interests " and called Article 5 a " sacred obligation . " He added : " I just want all of Europe to know that the United States is there . " <p> Prime Minister Mario Draghi of Italy spoke for many when he connected this summit with the Group of 7 summit meeting just concluded in Britain and compared them unfavorably with the period of Trump . " This summit is part of the process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , " which were " weakened by the previous administration , " Draghi said . <p> And he pointed to Biden 's similarly important meetings on Tuesday with the leaders of the European Union , which Trump considered an economic competitor and even a foe . " We are here to reaffirm these alliances , but also to reaffirm the importance of the European Union , " Draghi said . <p> Another key element of Biden 's European tour , which will conclude on Wednesday in Geneva , where he meets President Vladimir Putin of Russia for a highly anticipated conversation , is how the democracies of Asia and the West can stand up to the authoritarian challenge . While Russia is a particular threat to NATO and the Euro-Atlantic world , it is not an economic rival . <p> Speaking Monday night , Biden called Putin " a worthy adversary " and said he would look for areas of cooperation with Russia , while laying down red lines about Russian efforts to disrupt democratic societies . <p> " I 'm going to make clear to President Putin that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chooses , " Biden said . " And if he chooses not to cooperate , and acts in a way that he has in the past , relative to cybersecurity and some other activities , then we will respond . We will respond in kind . " <p> It is the rise of a rich , aggressive , authoritarian China , however , that Biden identifies as a major challenge to the United States and its allies , and his intention in Europe is to solicit allied support for efforts to meet that challenge -- militarily , technologically and economically . <p> While NATO has a role to play , so does the European Union , the largest economic bloc in the world , with deep trading ties to China . The European Union has been hardening its views of China in the face of Beijing 's human rights behavior at home and trade and espionage practices abroad . But the Europeans do not see China as quite the threat perceived by Washington . <p> That disparity is also true in NATO , despite the new communiqu ? on China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia in Central and Eastern Europe and the Baltic nations , are anxious that the shift in focus to China does not divert resources and attention from the Russian threat . <p> Biden made a point of meeting the leaders of Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania and Poland in Brussels before his meeting with Putin . NATO troops are deployed in all four countries . <p> But even Britain , probably Washington 's closest ally , expressed some wariness about confrontation with China . Asked at the NATO meeting about China , Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned against a " new Cold War , " while acknowledging that China 's rise was a " gigantic fact in our lives . " <p> Similarly , Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said after the meeting : " If you look at the cyberthreats and the hybrid threats , if you look at the cooperation between Russia and China , you can not simply ignore China . ' ' But she also said : " One must not overrate it , either -- we need to find the right balance . "

Not even Marie herself , who had been bottling up feelings of loneliness and sadness for months without telling anyone . <p> Her relationships with some of her closest friends had started to suffer when school went online last year , and she worried about losing other people in her life , too . What if they moved away ? What if they died ? <p> One weekday afternoon , she put on her headphones and listened to music while taking a walk , and she began to get increasingly upset .

Marie is being identified by her middle name . ) <p> The next day , Marie told her mother that " in the past , not too long before that , she had brought scissors in her bedroom with the intention of hurting herself , but did n't know how to , " Jackie said . " I was completely blindsided . " <p> It was n't as though Jackie was unaware of the mental health crisis affecting adolescents . She works as a nurse at two different paediatric intensive care units on the East Coast , where she has treated many children who attempted suicide in the past year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' How did you get the idea to do this ? ' " Social media is their typical response , she said . " They do n't grasp that if they hurt themselves , it might not be something we can fix , and they might not get better . " <p> Interviews with mental health providers and data from hospitals across the country reveal that while providers are continuing to see a surge in teenagers visiting the emergency room for mental health problems , the number of children in crisis under the age of 13 is also on the rise , and has been for years . <p> The youngest patient under Jackie 's care who had recently attempted suicide was 8 years old . She survived , but another child , also under 13 , was not as fortunate , and became an organ donor . Jackie said that most of the children who come in after suicide attempts are girls who have overdosed on pain medication , like Tylenol . Some of them now face liver damage . Once , after a particularly difficult day at work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up all the Tylenol and Motrin in their home . <p> " I do n't want to ever think we 're immune to these things , " she said . <p> ' We will see this crisis grow in the fall . ' <p> Even before the pandemic , a mental health crisis was brewing among children struggling with bullying , abuse , eating disorders , racism or undiagnosed mental health conditions . But now , children are facing even more stressors , like the loss of a family member to COVID-19 , adjusting to remote school or the anxiety of returning to in-person school . <p> " It 's almost like the pandemic threw gasoline on embers that were already glowing , " said Heather C. Huszti , chief psychologist at Children 's Hospital of Orange County in Orange , California . " We 've never seen it this bad . " <p> For young children , the pain can feel endless . <p> " It 's like , ' This is my life now . Do I have anything to look forward to ? ' " Huszti said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> CHOC , where Huszti works , has the only inpatient psychiatric centre in Orange County that can take children under 12 . In order to be admitted to one of the centre 's 18 beds , a child must be a current or imminent threat to themselves or to others . When the centre first opened in 2018 , about 10% of the children were under the age of 12 . In 2020 , that number began to increase , and now has more than doubled , Huszti said . <p> " We have some days where every kid in the unit is under 12 , " she said . <p> National data shows a similar pattern . In November , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a study that compared how often children came to emergency rooms in the United States for mental health reasons versus other types of concerns . The agency found that between April and October of 2020 , there was a 24% increase in the proportion of mental health emergency department visits for kids ages 5 to 11 compared with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be particularly dire among girls . During 2019 and 2020 , the proportion of mental health-related emergency department visits was higher for girls under 18 than it was for boys of the same age , the CDC reported . <p> " I anticipate that we will see this crisis grow in the fall as kids return to school and are trying to adjust to making up for a year of lost development , " said Dr. Jenna Glover , a child psychologist at Children 's Hospital Colorado in Aurora . <p> Among children who die by suicide , there are stark racial disparities . The rate of suicide in Black children under 13 has been increasing over the last decade and is two times higher than among white children . In two editorials published on Monday in JAMA Paediatrics , the authors called on funding agencies and journals to prioritize research on Black youth suicide ; and emphasized the need for preventive efforts that target stigma and institutional racism . <p> ' The younger the child is , the longer they wait . ' <p> Children 's hospitals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beds for mental health patients , have begun to run out of room . <p> Some inpatient psychiatric units may not be able to admit kids under 12 , she added , because they often require more one-on-one monitoring than older kids , as well as age-specific therapy . <p> In April , 11-year-old Lu and her mother , Nicole ( their middle names ) , had to wait in an emergency room in Ohio " all day and all night " because the hospital 's 13 paediatric beds were full and two kids were in line ahead of her . They were eventually transferred to a behavioural health hospital nearby . Lu befriended other kids there who had their own mental health struggles , including some who were several years older . At one point , she saw someone get sedated and restrained . <p> " I was concerned , " Nicole said . " She was exposed to so much there that I would n't want her to be exposed to . " <p> During the pandemic , Lu underwent " a really big personality change " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hormones and genetics . ( Nicole was diagnosed with depression and anxiety when she was in her early 20s . ) Lu became immersed in social media , and appeared to be caught in an algorithm that kept showing her videos of sad kids , her mother said . <p> " I had to actually explain that to her , " Nicole said . " I was like , ' Hey did you know if I like a picture of a pair of tennis shoes , I 'm going to probably keep seeing pictures of tennis shoes ? ' And she looked at me , and she was like , ' Really ? ' " <p> A couple of months ago , Nicole had the sudden urge to check the text messages saved on her daughter 's tablet . That was when she discovered that Lu had been planning on harming herself and had also written a goodbye letter . <p> How did we get here ? <p> Even though the stigma surrounding mental health care has declined somewhat in recent years , " we have not yet given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to manage their mental health , how to prevent or how to respond to suicidal thoughts , " said Dr Christine Moutier , chief medical officer of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention . <p> Many children also have underlying psychological problems that simply are n't being addressed . A study published in JAMA Pediatrics found that in 2016 half of the estimated 7.7 million children in the United States with a treatable mental health disorder did not receive treatment from a mental health professional . <p> Finding a provider can be difficult . The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry reported that there is a severe shortage of child psychiatrists in nearly every state in the country . In California , for example , there are only 13 practising child and adolescent psychiatrists for every 100,000 children under 18 . <p> Insurance companies do n't reimburse mental health services as highly as they do medical services , which makes it far less profitable for providers to treat mental health patients , experts say . For example , in Connecticut , Medicaid reimburses hospitals $2,665 per day for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a paediatric psychiatric hospitalization , said Ryan Calhoun , the vice president of strategy and care integration at Connecticut Children 's . <p> Finally , the American Academy of Paediatrics recommends mental health screening for all children 12 and older during well-child visits , but it is not standard practice to screen children younger than that , said Dr Tami D Benton , psychiatrist-in-chief of child and adolescent psychiatry and behavioural sciences at Children 's Hospital of Philadelphia . <p> " Previously , the under-12 's were identified as a low-risk group , " she said . <p> That 's not the case anymore , she added . <p> Kate , who lives in Colorado , was in the third grade when she told her parents that she did n't want to live anymore . For much of her childhood , she has suffered from sensory processing disorder , attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and anxiety , and she was bullied in elementary school . <p> " I felt like I was just a waste of space , " Kate , who is now 12 , said in an interview . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Back when she was 8 , her parents took her to the emergency room , where they stayed for about 12 hours until it was determined that Kate would be safe at home . <p> " You just feel like , gosh , what have I done wrong as a parent ?

Instead , take a deep breath and call the paediatrician or a crisis line , Hope said , " so that you do n't feel alone . " <p> ' There 's no place to send them . ' <p> Connecticut Children 's hospital in Hartford does not have any inpatient beds for paediatric psychiatric patients . It takes an average of one week before kids in the emergency room can find a bed elsewhere , Dr Jennifer Downs , the division head of child and adolescent psychiatry at Connecticut Children 's , said during an interview in late May . <p> On that particular day , 10 of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons were under 13 . Some children wait for an inpatient bed for as long as a month , she added . <p> " There 's no place to send them , " said James E Shmerling , the president and chief executive at Connecticut Children 's . " Every existing resource in the community has a backlog . " <p> In Colorado , the situation is also critical . This year , at any given time , about half of the kids in the paediatric emergency department at Children 's Hospital Colorado are experiencing a mental health crisis , which prompted the institution to declare a state of emergency in May . <p> Not only are Colorado 's emergency rooms full , so are the long-term paediatric residential facilities . More than 70 children with severe mental illness had to go out of state to find a residential treatment program over the last year and a half , some travelling as far as South Carolina , Florida or New York , said Heidi Baskfield , the vice president of population health and advocacy at Children 's Hospital Colorado . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are grappling with too . <p> Searching for solutions . <p> Health care institutions have been scrambling to find ways to treat more children with acute mental health needs . CHOC , for example , is planning to open an intensive outpatient program in the next year for children in middle school who are suicidal as well as a program to offer specialised therapy to children who are 8 and under . <p> At Children 's Hospital of the King 's Daughters in Virginia , there was a 300% increase in mental health emergency department visits among 2- to 12-year-olds from 2015 to 2020 . The hospital is in the process of expanding its outpatient programme to include group therapy for nearly all children , which will allow them to be treated faster than they would have if they needed to wait for one-on-one therapy , said Dr Mary Margaret Gleason , a paediatrician and child and adolescent psychiatrist there . <p> " The emergency room situation is a crisis , but it will be fixed only if we look at the preventive efforts that come well before , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working with children under 6 . " When you get into the preschool age , the level of unmet needs is extraordinary .

He is hoping to add a medical psychiatric unit to the hospital -- with as many as 15 beds -- next year . <p> Some states , including Colorado , are starting to funnel more money toward mental health services , though providers say even more is needed . <p> " For now , we do need beds to meet the surge , " Baskfield said .

Moreover , meat has been an important component of the diet for centuries . However , the meat may become inedible due to several factors such as chemical or enzymatic composition , outside moisture , light , heat , germs , oxygen , etc . These can also create infection of microorganisms like bacteria , mold , which increases the risk of developing various food borne diseases . Read this article to know the ways how to preserve the meat properly to last longer , remain fresh , healthy , and suitable for eating in a bactericidal state . <h> The Main Purpose of Preserving Meat <p> The purpose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top reasons to preserve meat . <p> - Keep the taste and quality of the meat as intact as possible . <p> - Keep the meat sterile . <p> - To prevent rotting of meat . <p> - Reducing financial losses by controlling the transmission of food-borne diseases by meat <p> People have been using various techniques to preserve meat at home and commercially since ancient times , which has now become more advanced , simpler , and more up-to-date . Let 's talk about the ways to preserve meat ( beef/mutton ) for a long time . <h> Ways to Preserve Fresh Beef or Mutton in Refrigerator/Freezer <p> In food science , meat is included in the list of highly perishable foods . This means that if not stored properly , the meat will spoil very quickly . If the animal is left outside for a long time after slaughtering , the meat becomes very soft . This destroys both the taste and nutritional value of the meat . So , the meat should be stored in the fridge as soon as possible . <p> However , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fridge . If the fridge is unclean , the meat may smell bad . Or , if you put it with any other smelly food , the stench can come from the meat . <p> - First of all , you have to clean the fridge/ freezer well . Keeping the fridge clean is very important for storing meat for a long time . The fridge is more likely to smell because of previous fish and meat . <p> - The blood from the meat must be thoroughly washed and cleaned before storing it . After washing , it should be kept in a big basket to drain excess water . After the water is drained from the meat , keep it in a polythene or plastic packet and keep it in the fridge by wrapping or closing the packet . <p> - The meat remains hard for three to four hours after the slaughtering . It is better not to keep the meat in the fridge at this time . After this time , if the meat is a little soft , it should be preserved . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not get too big . It is better to preserve the meat in small pieces . <p> - Thick and good-quality polythene should be chosen for storage in the fridge . You can even use zip-lock plastic bags . <p> - Each packet of meat can be separated in the fridge with a piece of thick paper in between . Hence , there will be no risk of sticking a packet of meat with other packets . <p> - New and clean packets must be used to preserve the meat . Using old or previously used polythene can cause the smell . <p> - After keeping the meat in the fridge , the temperature should be reduced . The meat will freeze quickly . So , the meat should be stored in the fridge below zero-degree Fahrenheit temperature . Raw meat can be stored for 4-7 days at 40 degrees Fahrenheit . In addition , if you store the meat below zero-degree Fahrenheit temperature , raw beef/mutton will be good for 12 months . <p> Since Covid 19 pandemic is going , we have to be careful while storing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Covid 19 from food or even food packing . But , for safety , washing the refrigerator or freezer is enough . <p> Preserving beef/ mutton properly to maintain freshness for a long time <h> Ways to preserve fresh beef or mutton without Refrigerator/Freezer <p> Although a freezer is the easiest and safest way to preserve meat , there are many other ways to preserve meat without using the refrigerator . Let 's have a look . <h> Preserve by Cooking <p> The meat should be washed well , mixed with turmeric and salt , and then cooked with water . This meat will be good for several days if you warm it up at least twice a day . However , if the amount of fat in the meat is high , it will remain good for a long time . <h> Store by Drying in the Sun <p> As a result of drying the meat in this process , there is no water in it . Thus the meat can be stored for a long time . For this , the meat has to be cut into small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now the meat should be hooked by thin wire and dried in the sun . <p> If you are drying the meat on the roof , verandah , or yard , it should be wrapped in a thin cloth so that it will not get dust and dirt in the meat . The meat should be dried in the sun for five to six days in a row , and this will dry out all the water . <p> However , it is better not to follow this method if there is no sun because if not dried properly , the meat can be spoiled . Sun-dried meat should be soaked in mildly hot water before cooking . This will soften the meat . In this way , you can store the meat at normal temperature in a container or in a normal fridge for three months to one year . <h> Preserve the Meat with Lemon and Salt <p> For this , the meat should be cut into medium sizes .

High-resolution computer models suggest that slow-moving storms could become 14 times more common over land by the end of the century in a worst-case scenario . The slower a storm moves , the more rain it dumps on a small area and the greater the risk of serious flooding . Researchers already knew that the higher air temperatures caused by the climate crisis mean the atmosphere can hold more moisture , which in turn has led to more extreme downpours . The latest analysis , however , is the first to assess the role of slow-moving storms in causing extreme downpours in Europe . The storms projected in the new study move even more slowly than those which drenched Germany , the Netherlands and other countries in the past week and so would lead to even more extreme rainfall and flooding . The simulations give the idea that even worse can happen , said Abdullah Kahraman at Newcastle University in the UK , who led the research . Prof Lizzie Kendon at the UK Met Office said : This study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global warming , we can also expect a big increase in slow-moving storms . This is very relevant to the recent flooding seen in Germany and Belgium , which highlights the devastating impacts of slow-moving storms.Scientists think the rapidly warming Arctic may be the root cause of slowing weather systems , by decelerating high-level winds such as the jet stream . The phenomenon has already been linked to devastating heatwaves in Russia and floods in Pakistan . The study showed the biggest increase in slow-moving storms over land was in the summer . In the summertime , especially in August , the highest increase occurs over a large part of the European continent , said Kahraman . He was surprised the modelled impact extended to the colder northern regions of Europe : We found that the whole of Europe , including the UK and Scandinavia , experience such really slow extreme rainstorm potential , he said .

@@52967240 <h> Should vaccinated people start wearing masks again ? <p> Masked patrons visit the The Metropolitan Museum of Art on a Saturday in Manhattan , July 10 , 2021 . The New York Times <h> As the delta variant spreads among the unvaccinated , many fully vaccinated people are also beginning to worry . Is it time to mask up again ? <p> While there 's no one-size-fits-all answer to the question , most experts agree that masks remain a wise precaution in certain settings for both the vaccinated and unvaccinated . How often you use a mask will depend on your personal health tolerance and risk , the infection and vaccination rates in your community , and who you 're spending time with . <p> The bottom line is this : While being fully vaccinated protects against serious illness and hospitalisation from COVID-19 , no vaccine offers 100% protection . As long as large numbers of people remain unvaccinated and continue to spread coronavirus , vaccinated people will be exposed to the delta variant , and a small percentage of them will develop so-called breakthrough infections . Here are answers to common questions about how you can protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When should a vaccinated person wear a mask ? <p> To decide whether a mask is needed , first ask yourself these questions . <p> -- Are the people I 'm with also vaccinated ? <p> -- What 's the case rate and vaccination rate in my community ? <p> -- Will I be in a poorly ventilated indoor space , or outside ? Will the increased risk of exposure last for a few minutes or for hours ? <p> -- What 's my personal risk ( or the risk for those around me ) for complications from COVID-19 ? <p> Experts agree that if everyone you 're with is vaccinated and symptom-free , you do n't need to wear a mask . <p> " I do n't wear a mask hanging out with other vaccinated people , " said Dr Ashish K Jha , dean of the Brown University School of Public Health . " I do n't even think about it . I 'm going to the office with a bunch of people , and they 're all vaccinated . I 'm not worried about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public spaces where the chances of your encountering unvaccinated people are greater , a mask is probably a good idea . Being fully vaccinated remains the strongest protection against COVID-19 , but risk is cumulative . The more opportunities you give the virus to challenge the antibodies you 've built up from your vaccine , the higher your risk of coming into contact with a large enough exposure that the virus will break through the protective barrier generated by your vaccine . <p> For that reason , the case rate and vaccination rate of your community are among the most important factors influencing the need for masks . In Vermont , Massachusetts , Connecticut and Rhode Island , for instance , more than 70% of adults are fully vaccinated . In Alabama , Mississippi and Arkansas , fewer than 45% of adults are vaccinated . In some counties , overall vaccination rates are far lower . <p> " We 're two COVID nations right now , " said Dr Peter Hotez , dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine and co-director of the Center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harris County , Texas , where Hotez lives , case counts are rising , up by 114% in the past two weeks , and only 44% of the community is fully vaccinated . " I 'm wearing a mask indoors most of the time , " Hotez said . <p> Finally , masking is more important in poorly ventilated indoor spaces than outdoors , where risk of infection is extremely low . Jha notes that he recently dashed into a coffee shop , unmasked , because in his area of the country , infection rates are low and vaccination rates are high , and he was only there for a few minutes . <p> Your personal risk matters , too . If you are older or immune compromised , your antibody response to the vaccine may not be as strong as the response in a young person . Avoiding crowded spaces and wearing a mask when you 're indoors and do n't know the vaccination status of those around you is a good idea . <p> Why is the delta variant prompting experts to rethink mask guidance ? <p> When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccinated people could stop wearing masks , case counts were dropping , vaccinations were on the rise and the highly-infectious delta variant had not yet taken hold . Since then , delta has spread rapidly and now accounts for more than 83% of cases in the United States . <p> People infected with the delta variant are known to shed much higher levels of virus for longer periods of time compared with earlier lineages of the coronavirus . One preliminary study estimated the viral load is 1,000 times greater in people with the delta variant . These high viral loads give the virus more opportunities to challenge your antibodies and break through your vaccine 's protection . <p> " This is twice as transmissible as the original lineage of COVID , " Hotez said . " The reproductive number of the virus is around 6 , " he said , referring to the number of people a virus carrier is likely to infect . " That means 85% of the population needs to be vaccinated . Only a few areas of the country are reaching that . " <p> Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ museums , the movies , a wedding or other large gatherings ? <p> The answer depends on your personal risk tolerance and the level of vaccinations and COVID-19 cases in your community . The more time you spend with unvaccinated people in enclosed spaces for long periods of time , the higher your risk of crossing paths with the delta variant , or any other variants that may crop up . <p> Large gatherings , by definition , offer more opportunities to get infected with coronavirus , even if you 're vaccinated . Scientists have documented breakthrough infections at a recent wedding in Oklahoma and July 4 celebrations in Provincetown , Massachusetts . <p> But even with the delta variant , full vaccination appears to be about 90% effective at preventing serious illness and hospitalisation from COVID-19 . If you are at very high risk for complications from COVID-19 , however , you should consider avoiding risky situations and wearing a mask when the vaccination status of those around you is unknown . <p> Healthy vaccinated people who are at low risk of complications have to decide what level of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mask at larger indoor gatherings will lower their risk for infection . If you 're healthy and vaccinated but caring for an aging parent or spending time with others at high risk , you should consider their risk , too , when deciding whether to attend an event or wear a mask . <p> " If I go into a public area , I 'll generally wear a mask , " Hotez said . " Up until recently I took my son and his girlfriend out for dinner in a restaurant , and I would n't wear a mask because transmission was way down . Now I 'm not so sure . I may readjust my thinking about restaurants while delta is accelerating . " <p> If breakthrough infections are rare , why do I keep hearing about them ? <p> Breakthrough infections get a lot of attention because vaccinated people talk about them on social media . When clusters of breakthrough infections happen , they also are reported in science journals or the media . <p> But it 's important to remember that while breakthrough cases are relatively rare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get . <p> " No vaccines are 100% effective at preventing illness in vaccinated people , " the CDC states on its website . " There will be a small percentage of fully vaccinated people who still get sick , are hospitalised or die from COVID-19 . " <p> A breakthrough case does n't mean your vaccine is n't working . In fact , most cases of breakthrough infections result in no symptoms or only mild illness , which shows the vaccines are working well to prevent serious illness from COVID-19 . <p> As of July 12 , more than 159 million people in the United States had been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 . Of those , just 5,492 had breakthrough cases that resulted in serious illness , including 1,063 who died . That 's less than 0.0007% of the vaccinated population . Meanwhile , 99% of deaths from COVID-19 are among the unvaccinated . <p> Many infectious disease experts are frustrated that the CDC is only documenting cases in which a vaccinated person with COVID-19 is hospitalised or dies . But many breakthrough infections still are being detected in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players and Olympic athletes . Many of those people are traveling or spending extended periods of time in close quarters with others . <p> " Sports figures are different , " Jha said . " Part of the problem is they are also encountering a lot of unvaccinated people , including in their own little circle . " <p> I 'm vaccinated . How often should I be tested for COVID-19 ? <p> If you 're fully vaccinated and you know you 've been exposed to someone with COVID-19 , it 's a good idea to be tested , even if you do n't have symptoms . <p> And if you have cold symptoms or any other signs of infection , experts agree you should be tested . Many vaccinated people who are n't wearing masks have picked up summer colds that cause runny noses , fever and coughing . But it 's impossible to tell the difference between a summer cold and COVID-19 . Anyone with cough or cold symptoms should wear a mask to protect those around them and get tested to rule out COVID-19 . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on hand as well . <p> " If I woke up one morning and had cold symptoms , I would put on a mask at home , and I would get myself tested , " Jha said . " I do n't want to cause breakthrough infections for other members of my family , and I do n't want to give it to my 9-year-old kid . "

Reuters <h> Justice Samuel Alito on Friday temporarily paused a ruling from a federal judge in Texas that had required the Biden administration to reinstate a Trump-era immigration program forcing asylum-seekers arriving at the nation 's southern border to await approval in Mexico . <p> The judge 's ruling was to have gone into effect after midnight Friday . Alito instead granted the Biden administration an " administrative stay , " one meant to preserve the status quo " so that the full court can consider the application . " <p> The stay will expire , unless the court takes further action , at midnight Tuesday . Alito ordered the states challenging the program , Texas and Missouri , to respond to the Biden administration 's arguments by Tuesday evening . <p> On Thursday , a federal appeals panel in Texas denied the Biden administration 's attempt to stop the judge 's ruling , which mandated the reinstatement of the asylum policy , known commonly as Remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The stay offered at least a temporary reprieve for the Biden administration after a series of judicial setbacks in its effort to reverse President Donald Trump 's hard-line immigration policies . In a separate case , a federal judge in Texas temporarily blocked the administration 's short-term strategy to limit the arrests of immigrants who lack legal status by prioritising those who posed the greatest threats to national security and public safety . <p> A spokeswoman for the Justice Department said that the agency was reviewing the 160-page ruling in that second case from Judge Drew B. Tipton of the US District Court for the Southern District of Texas , and lawyers were weighing next steps . <p> Taken together , the lower-court actions threaten two of the Biden administration 's earliest efforts to reshape the nation 's immigration system . Another blow came in July , when a federal judge ruled that an Obama-era program that has protected hundreds of thousands of young immigrants from deportation was unlawful . <p> The rapid-fire string of decisions underscored the role of the courts as the primary venue for shaping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- a strategy that immigration advocates honed during the Trump administration . <p> " Those who are opposed to the Biden administration 's immigration agenda are taking every and any opportunity to take policy questions and have them answered in favorable courts , " Tom K. Wong , director of the US Immigration Policy Center at the University of California , San Diego , said . <p> The order stating that the Biden administration must reinstate the Trump policy that forced asylum-seekers to wait in Mexico while their cases were considered in the United States came from Judge Matthew J. Kacsmaryk , of the US District Court for the Northern District of Texas . <p> He and Tipton were both appointed by President Donald Trump . Of the three judges on the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals who rejected the administration 's request to stop the " Remain in Mexico " ruling on Thursday , two were Trump appointees ; the third was appointed by President George W. Bush . <p> In their appeal to the Supreme Court , government lawyers said reinstating the asylum policy on Saturday would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Critics said it would place asylum-seekers in dangerous congregate settings at a time when the highly contagious delta variant was fueling a surge in coronavirus cases . <p> It was not immediately clear what exactly would have been set into motion on Saturday as a result of the order , or whether Mexico would permit the reinstatement of the program . <p> The program was litigated during the Trump administration as well . <p> " You will likely see , with future Biden administration policies , that those opposed will use the courts to stunt further progress , which just amplifies the importance of congressional action , " Wong said . <p> The latest example is the effort to stop the administration from prioritising which unauthorised immigrants to arrest . <p> In February , the Biden administration issued its temporary arrest priorities for Immigration and Customs Enforcement , a stark change from the Trump administration 's policy of arresting immigrants for any suspected immigration violation . The Biden team ordered ICE officers to prioritise arresting people lacking legal status who pose national security and public safety risks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Obama administration set similar enforcement priorities . <p> Texas is a party in both cases and has borne the brunt of the unusually high number of illegal border crossings this year , with many migrant families and children from Central America arriving in the state 's Rio Grande Valley and overwhelming border officials . The state has taken several actions to challenge the Biden administration 's immigration policies ; earlier this summer , Gov . Greg Abbott , a Republican , directed state law enforcement officials to start arresting migrants for trespassing to address illegal immigration -- because , he said , the Biden administration was not . <p> Alejandro N. Mayorkas , the homeland security secretary , has been working to draft permanent arrest priorities for ICE , which would replace the interim ones currently being challenged . It was not immediately clear if the judge 's ruling would also apply to any final arrest priorities the administration imposed . <p> If the Biden administration is not able to continue its strategy for immigration arrests , the shift will likely further strain an immigration detention system that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by more than half so far this year , compared to the same period in 2020 , according to immigration statistics -- in part because of pandemic-driven rules about limiting the number of people in congregate settings and the temporary arrest priorities . <p> Wong said that even if Republicans succeeded in challenging the arrest priorities , it would not change the reality that there was not sufficient detention space . <p> " And so policies of ' enforcement en masse ' do n't take into account the finite resources , " he said , " including limited detention capacity . " <p> The administration is also waiting for a judge to rule on a lawsuit that would prevent it from continuing a public health rule that the Trump administration put in place early in the pandemic to turn away many asylum-seeking families arriving at the border . Immigration advocates filed the lawsuit last year , and at the time , Vice President Kamala Harris , then a senator from California and presidential candidate , argued against the rule . <p> Lawyers for the plaintiffs hoped a settlement could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last month when the White House decided it would not lift the public health rule any time soon because of the overwhelming number of migrants arriving at the southern border and the risk of more COVID-19 infections . <p> If the courts ultimately order the administration to lift the public health rule , it will stretch the federal government 's enforcement capabilities even more .

@@53073233 <p> Draw-cards aside , the tourism industry needs to create and aggressively market new products that focus solely on the expatriate market , as there are a tremendous number of expatriates who rarely leave Dhaka , and so their perception of Bangladesh is based solely on their impressions of the capital city . Not only is this a serious and grave error , these are the impressions that expatriates take to other countries around the world . The fact is that expatriates are the springboard for accessing new tourist markets as one can never underestimate the power of the word of mouth . It is very rare to meet short-term visitors to Bangladesh , and the ones that do visit for less than a month are usually here as guests of people that already live here . Currently , this same expatriate market generates a section of people who mostly choose to take their holidays outside Bangladesh instead of inside , which once again demonstrates the terrible lack of linkages between Bangladesh 's professional operators and the proposed target market .

The goal of these initiatives is to create a buzz that will generate new visitor arrivals in the country and eventually drive the tourism market forward .

Opportunities for exploration abound , the countryside is beautiful and Bangladesh 's economy is plodding forward despite some unfathomable hindrances .

@@53073236 <h> 27 Years of Jeff Buckley 's Amazing " Grace " <p> On this day in 1994 , a then little-known singer-songwriter based in New York would release his first and only studio album in his lifetime . Back then , Jeff Buckley was 27 years old . This year , his resplendent debut , Grace , turns 27 as well . <p> 1994 was the peak of the grunge era when mainstream rock was abrasive , and the voices raspier and deeper . Think Cobain , Cornell , and Vedder . Soft , high-pitched male voices and melodic alt-rock were starting to go out of fashion . Yet , Buckley 's ethereal vocals inspired the likes of Thom Yorke and Chris Martin to embrace their upper registers . <p> Unfortunately , Buckley would n't live to see the impact Grace would leave on future generations of artists , having to contend himself with lukewarm sales and mixed reviews . <p> In the years after Buckley 's untimely death , Grace would rank higher and higher in greatest album polls , although not as high as I 'd like it to be . His heartbreaking cover of Leonard Cohen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometime around Grace 's 25th anniversary , I would fall in love with it , a love that has yet to reach its limits . <p> My introduction to Jeff Buckley , like many others , was the aforementioned cover of " Hallelujah " . Then , sometime in my late teens , I started venturing out of just that one song everyone knows , an overrated song by an underrated singer . By the time longtime devotees were celebrating Grace 's silver jubilee , I was a convert . I understood why David Bowie would choose to take this record on a desert island . Because I would , too . <p> On the surface , the songs of Grace heavily explore love like most music in all of history . It has one of the most beautiful ballads I 've ever heard , " Lover , You Should 've Come Over . " But something in Jeff Buckley 's otherworldly voice and moving lyrics is more transcendental than love , which is difficult to put into words . Brad Pitt agrees , too . " There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's something you ca n't pinpoint . " You have to listen to the haunting " Dream Brother , " the angelic " Corpus Christi Carol , " or the hypnotic " Lilac Wine " to understand what I mean . The latter two are covers , which goes to show how he could make any song his own with his unique musical talent . Brace yourselves , though , for you might get overwhelmed by the beauty of it all . <p> As heart-wrenching as Grace can be , it has proven to be cathartic on many a sleepless , depressed night as I listened to the album on repeat . It kept me company like an old , trusted friend , weathering me through internal storms . In many instances , the title track itself would act as a soothing salve on my soul , even though the scream at the end takes my breath away every time . " Grace , " I believe , is Buckley 's best song because it encapsulates the pinnacle of his artistry . In every other song , his heavenly voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ailing your heart and embrace you in a warm cocoon , even in the grungy , politically charged " Eternal Life . " That 's among the many reasons Grace is my favourite album . <p> And so , at the beginning of the pandemic , when I was yet to get used to lockdowns , I found myself returning to old favourites , things to ground me in these strange times . Once again , Grace came to the rescue . I found myself falling in love again , perhaps even deeper this time . I went down the Jeff Buckley rabbit hole , listening to live shows and other official posthumous releases . I marvelled at how his voice moulded to cover his musical influences , from Led Zeppelin to Henry Purcell to Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan to ? dith Piaf . Yes , he could even sing opera and qawwali . All of this made me mourn the unrealised music Buckley could have gifted the world had he lived to this day . <p> " Grace is what matters , in anything , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun too quickly . It keeps you from destroying things too foolishly . It sort of keeps you alive ; and it keeps you open for more understanding . " There is no better description for Grace and what it means to me . It has provided me with graceful respite during difficult times . I know I can fall back on it whenever I need comfort , whether it is to nurse future heartbreaks , or just whenever life and the world get too overwhelming . And for that , I 'll be eternally grateful to Jeff Buckley . <p> Adhora Ahmed listens to too many " sad white boy " songs , including this album , of course .

( Kenny Holston/The New York Times ) <h> President Joe Biden , confronting a worrisome new coronavirus variant and a potential winter surge , laid out a pandemic strategy Thursday that includes hundreds of vaccination sites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international travellers and free at-home tests . <p> After nearly a year of pushing vaccination as the way out of the pandemic , Biden has been unable to overcome resistance to the shots in red states and rural areas . His new strategy shifts away from a near-singular focus on vaccination and places a fresh emphasis on testing -- a tacit acknowledgment by the White House that vaccination is not enough to end the worst public health crisis in a century . <p> Biden 's announcement came as several new cases of the omicron variant were reported in the United States , including five people in New York state , a Minnesota resident who had recently traveled to New York City and a Colorado resident who had recently returned from southern Africa . Hawaii also reported its first known case , and California its second . <p> Biden 's remarks at the National Institutes of Health were the second time this week that he had addressed the nation on the pandemic ; on Monday , he spoke about new travel restrictions he imposed last week on eight African nations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science and speed , not chaos and confusion , " Biden said Thursday . <p> Conquering the pandemic -- or at least bringing it under control -- is by far Biden 's most daunting task as president , and it is all the more complicated because it has become so divisive . Biden struck a theme of unity in his remarks , urging Americans to come together around his plan . <p> Yet even as the president spoke , Republicans on Capitol Hill threatened to shut down the government over his vaccine rules for large employers . Vaccine mandates have been held up in court , and Biden emphasized that his current plan does not " expand or add to those mandates " and " does n't include shutdowns or lockdowns . " <p> Experts agree that widespread vaccination is critical to controlling the pandemic . But they also argue that masks and testing are essential and say that the testing will become even more urgent if the omicron variant is found to evade protection from vaccines , which has not yet been established . Biden , they say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ban your way out of this pandemic , and at the same time you have to have a response , " said Michael T. Osterholm , an infectious disease expert at the University of Minnesota , referring to the travel restrictions . " This virus has not dealt us a very good hand , and we 've got to play the cards we 've been given . " <p> The president is also imposing new testing rules on international travellers to the United States ; beginning early next week , White House officials said , such travellers will be required to present evidence of a negative test within a day before departure . He said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was studying alternatives to quarantining in schools , including " test-to-stay " policies , in which exposed students wear masks and keep testing to remain in school . <p> Much of what Biden announced was fairly modest . He steered clear of the contentious topic of mask mandates , except to announce that he was extending the current mandate for people on airplanes , trains and buses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was originally set to expire Jan. 18 . <p> " They should have highlighted the importance of masking , " said Dr. Carlos del Rio , an infectious disease expert at Emory University , adding , " This virus has proved to be a formidable enemy , and we need to require multiple strategies . " <p> White House officials , and the president himself , have said the plan is aimed at keeping the economy and schools open . Yet it remains unclear how the strategy , and the administration 's new policies , will affect an economic recovery that faces new waves of uncertainty from omicron . <p> Analysts on Wall Street and elsewhere have issued a range of forecast warnings for growth and inflation in recent days as concern over the new variant has increased , predicting it could prove to be a relatively small setback for a still-healing global economy -- or a major hit to it , if it produces widespread infection and death . <p> Some warn that new restrictions , like those on travel that Biden and European nations have begun to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their incomes on goods , as opposed to travel or dining out , adding new strains to global supply chains and potentially fueling even faster price increases for items like furniture and electronics . And they could discourage virus-wary Americans from returning to the workforce in droves in January , as White House officials had hoped would be the case . <p> White House economists are analyzing those possibilities , along with the chance that omicron does not materially hurt growth -- or that it could help tame inflation by easing demand for gasoline and other items . <p> A big part of Biden 's plan is a renewed push to get people vaccinated -- including the latest group to become eligible , children ages 5 to 11 . After winding down mass vaccination sites this year , the administration plans to open " hundreds of family vaccination clinics " that will offer vaccinations and boosters for people of all eligible ages , according to a fact sheet provided by the White House . <p> The plan also includes a national campaign to reach the 100 million Americans who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign will include paid advertising and free rides to vaccination sites coordinated by AARP , the advocacy group for older Americans . And the Federal Emergency Management Agency will start what the administration is calling family mobile vaccination clinics , beginning with deployments to Washington and New Mexico . The goal is for states and localities to replicate the model " with full federal funding and support , " officials said . <p> Biden also called on employers to provide paid time off for their workers to get boosters and said his administration would do the same for federal employees . <p> Many experts predict a winter surge in the United States , regardless of whether omicron spreads widely here . The nation has been reporting an average of more than 80,000 new cases a day over the past few weeks , according to a New York Times database ; six months ago , the average was roughly 12,000 new cases a day . <p> Much remains unknown about omicron , which was spotted by scientists in southern Africa last week and is now known to be present in more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may allow it to spread more quickly and cause more breakthrough infections in vaccinated or previously infected people , though neither characteristic has yet been confirmed . <p> Experts welcomed Biden 's new emphasis on testing .

" But for unknown reasons , we still have considered it primarily as a medical device .

@@53417240 <h> Mandar the mother tree <p> A Pata Bulbuli ( golden-fronted chloropsis ) is about to enjoy nectar from Mandar flowers in Habiganj 's Satchhari National Park . Bellow , a Mandar tree in full bloom there . Photo : Dr Reza Khan <p> During the first week of this March there was unexpected weather in the country . Forest was no exception . When I tried to hit the famous watch tower in the Satchhari National Park under the Habiganj district my vision was blurred by tiny droplets of the thick mist . I could see a six-storey tall tree that was of the height of the tower . During the spring of 2015 to present time hundreds of Bangladeshi bird photographers swarmed to the top tier of this watch tower just to shoot pictures of birds that get attracted to the flowers crowding at the canopy of the tree . It 's Mandar tree , serving as the mother of all trees as maximum number of wildlife visit these flowers , pollinate them and in the process collect nectar and pollen from the large , showy flowers . <p> Mandar is an indigenous tree with thorny body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In our childhood we used its branches for fencing crop fields to deter cattle , goats and sheep from fields and damaging grains and vegetables . I think people are still continuing the practice as I had seen its practice in the Narikel Jinjira Dwip earlier this year . <p> There are two species of Mandar in the country . Its common name is Coral Tree , from the coral red flowers that resemble the flowers of Pea or Motorshuti and Palash as these are boat-shaped . Most of these flowers are laden with nectar and are a readymade store of pollens that are relished by insects such as ants , bees , butterflies , some birds and mammals like the bats , squirrels , civets , and small primates . <p> Naturally , species such as Erythirna ovalifolia or fusca and E variegate or indica are present in our moist deciduous Shal forest and mixed-evergreen or Misrochirosabuj or Chirohorit Bon . These two types of forests used to occur in the central parts of Bangladesh and in northeast to southeast Bangladesh . From time immemorial , people collected seeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the villages more for their showy vermillion red and large flowers . Later , these trees had gone wild and usually grew on the banks of ponds , dighis and some wetlands . There is virtually no value for their timber either for furniture making or as fuel wood but are of ornamental , aesthetic and crop protection use . <p> Mandar is a tall , seven to 15 metres , deciduous tree , seasonally the plant becomes completely barren when they all are in flowers . Once the flowers mature and turn to fruits the tree starts getting new shoots that may last almost for nine months or so . The bark is covered with numerous spiky thorns . Its trifoliate , means leaf is divided into three leaflets born on a long petiole . Midribs of leaves often bear soft thorns . The flowers grow in branch or twig tips forming a cluster of several to over a dozen showy crimson , red , orange-red , scarlet or vermillion colours . The tree is usually without any branch in the first few metres of the trunk from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two to three metres in height and more than 10 metres in circumference . <p> During spring all trees get brilliantly coloured flowers that last for 2 to 3 months . Also , all buds in one tree do not flower at a time . They do so , rather progressively . This is the reason nectivorous birds and other wildlife of a forest or a village could get ready supply of sweet sugary and powdery meals from the bloom of this tree . <p> In most forests the flowers are in the canopy level of the forest that make them very showy and attractive to the nectar seekers who often fly past the canopies and land there to enjoy a meal . <p> In the lone tree by the tower in Satchhari , over 50 species of birds , many species of ants , bees , butterflies , monkeys and squirrels have been seen . During my second day of sojourn in the tower I could see almost all species of Mynas or Shaliks , Bulbuls , Moutushis or Sunbirds , Fuljhuri or Flowerpeckers , Orioles , Kokil or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Drongos , Bashonto Bouri or Barbets , Harichacha or Treepie , Shetakkhi or White-eye , Towfik or Common Iora , Pata Bulbuli or Leafbird or Chloropsis etc . Woodpeckers visited the tree both for nectar and chiselling out insect larvae from the old barks and foliages . And even a Roktochusha or Garden Lizard was found basking in the tree top and later on found it swooping on insects visiting the tree at a height of 10 metres or so ! That was very unusual for a garden lizard to be basking in a forest canopy . <p> So , a lone tree laden with showy flowers could prove to be a mother of all trees as this attracts most nectar , pollen and insect eating birds and other wildlife to such a tree . Such a tree should never be cut from any forest and government property in the country . Also , we should encourage public representatives from village to the town levels to plant not only Mandar but also all indigenous trees and shrubs with showy flowers and soft fleshy fruits . These are bound to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mammals to visit such plants . At the same time these will increase the beauty of the road sides and bridal paths , market places , compounds of educational institutions , premises of offices and play grounds . In addition , these will provide shade to the people , fix nitrogen to the soil and nesting sites for many birds .

Abdul says his business has been able to survive largely because of significantly discounted rent from landlords . ( OK McCausland/The New York Times ) <h> For two decades , 99 Cent Fresh Pizza , a New York City chain , has charged $1 for a slice of cheese pizza , luring anyone who needed to fill up for cheap in a notoriously expensive city , from construction workers to students to late-night partiers . <p> But the pandemic has thrown its business model , which relies on heavy foot traffic in office districts and tourist hubs , into an existential crisis . With inflation rising at its fastest pace in a generation , prices for just about everything -- from pizza boxes to pepperoni , flour and oil -- have skyrocketed . <p> The chain 's owner , Mohammad Abdul , is now agonising over whether to raise prices for the first time since opening in 2001 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " Some customers do n't have the money to buy the pizza . I 'm thinking how low can I sell it and help the customer . " <p> Abdul is one of the last holdouts in New York City 's fiercely competitive dollar-slice pizza scene , where a growing number of chains have raised prices or closed locations permanently , in part because some can no longer pay their rent . No other city in the US has a dollar-slice culture quite like New York , which took off in popularity after the 2008 recession . <p> Pizza businesses nationwide were hugely successful during the pandemic , well positioned to handle takeout and delivery . But inflation , pervading nearly every aspect of the economy , has been especially threatening to dollar-slice operators in New York , which maintained razor-thin profit margins by depending entirely on customer volume and cost efficiency . <p> Many owners of dollar-slice businesses , including those who raised prices , said their revenues are half of what they were in 2019 , before the pandemic . <p> In November @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decades , fuelled in part by a 6.8% increase in food prices , according to the most recent Labor Department report . <p> Restaurant prices in the New York area last month had their largest year-over-year increase since 1987 , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics . <p> In a potential bellwether for the universe of $1 goods , Dollar Tree also announced last month that it would raise prices of most items to $1.25 by the end of April to offset wage increases and higher distribution costs . <p> For pizzerias , each ingredient has become more expensive for its own reasons , economists say . <p> A severe drought in parts of the US and Canada decimated wheat crops , driving up flour prices . Worker shortages at meat-processing plants led to higher prices for pepperoni .

Kull sells primarily to pizzerias in Manhattan , including dollar-slice chains . <p> Some deliveries that used to arrive to customers at 9 am now come at 7 pm , Kull said . And when trucks fail to show up in the morning , restaurant owners scramble to find emergency supplies for the day , paying much higher prices . <p> In the cutthroat world of cheap pizza , owners have also accused rivals of paying illegally low wages and topping pizzas with fake cheese products . <p> The mere concept of charging $1 a slice is controversial in pizza circles .

Everybody I talk to , they are thinking of moving out , " Batin said , referring to the community of pizzeria owners from Bangladesh . " Nobody can do it for a dollar a slice anymore . " <p> He said his business was hurt by the large number of regular customers who are still working from home . <p> Outside Batin 's store in Downtown Brooklyn , there are both " help wanted " and " space for rent " signs .

Reuters <h> Iranian scientist Kaveh Madani 's career was in full bloom as he settled into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bangkok to Tehran . <p> Though raised in the Iranian capital , the civil engineer had left the country at 22 to continue his studies abroad , earning renown for his research into how climate change affects water supplies . About six months earlier , however , the Iranian government had wooed the 36-year-old away from a prestigious professorship in London to a cabinet-level post as deputy environment minister . <p> On this day , he was finishing up a four-country trip representing Tehran at meetings on water resources and other environmental issues . After takeoff , he connected to the Wi-Fi and checked his Twitter feed . <p> Several Twitter accounts had posted old pictures of him at a party dancing with women -- considered a grave breach of decorum by ultra-conservatives in Iran 's cleric-dominated government . The more he scrolled , the more alarmed he grew . <p> " Kaveh Madani , deputy head of the department of environment , gets drunk and dances in a building that belongs to the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran in Malaysia , " read one Tweet , written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation . " <p> Madani suspected that Islamist hard-liners were behind the post , and he worried that intelligence officers might be waiting to arrest him at the Tehran airport . It was n't idle speculation . A feud was playing out between ultraconservatives and the relatively moderate government of his boss , President Hassan Rouhani , and Madani had already been caught up in it . <p> Agents had arrested him when he landed in Tehran to take the job as a cabinet official the year before , and had subjected him to several days of interrogation on suspicion of being a Western spy -- a common slur against internationalists . In the next few months , he was questioned and sometimes detained several more times . <p> This time , however , it felt different . This time , they had attacked him publicly . This time , he feared , he would n't be freed . <p> " The way the Islamic Republic intelligence works , they do n't manage risk , " he said . " They remove risk . " <p> Kaveh Madani is photographed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2019 . Reuters <p> On that day , however , fortune favoured Madani : He 'd missed his direct flight to Tehran because of an unplanned meeting and was booked on a connection through Istanbul . When he landed in Turkey , he never boarded the plane to Tehran , and instead went into hiding . <p> Kaveh Madani 's career path , though tinged with perilous intrigue , speaks to the particular challenges faced by scientists and environmentalists in the developing world -- both politically and practically . <p> Climate science has been politicised in rich nations , too , of course , including the United States and Australia . In Iran , climate change is political , but not in the same way . Iranian officials do n't reject climate change . Instead , they blame the country 's chronic water shortages and desertification on the Western industrial nations that have caused the lion 's share of carbon emissions . Yes , that 's a problem , Madani says , but he also believes it 's a fig leaf . He says his research has found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be overused by developers and farmers and diverting it away from its source to cities . <p> There 's another difference between Iran and countries such as America and Australia : They do n't put scientists and policymakers in jail . <p> An even more fundamental problem for scientists in the developing world is a paucity of funding for all sorts of basic research . That 's clear from the rankings of the Hot List , a Reuters tally of the world 's 1,000 most influential climate scientists . Although the developing world accounts for about 70% of the world 's population , scientists working in those countries make up just one in 20 of the Hot List 's membership . <p> To win research opportunities , many bright young researchers go abroad to more affluent nations . That 's what Madani did , leaving for Sweden and then California for graduate school . Some never return . <p> " There 's very , very little opportunity to get funded , " said Saleemul Huq , a climate-adaptation researcher from Bangladesh whose son studied under Madani at Imperial College London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time teaching and very little of our time doing research because the potential for getting funding to do that is very limited . " <p> Madani 's political troubles have had another impact . He took refuge in Toronto , disrupting his research . He was still occasionally publishing , but his output went down and he fell off the Hot List . <p> Reuters made numerous attempts to contact the Iranian government for this story . Reporters contacted officials at the Iranian mission to the United Nations in New York and attempted to reach officials in Tehran by telephone and email from Dubai . No one with the Iranian government responded . <p> Several of Madani 's friends and colleagues , in both the United States and in Iran , corroborated much of his version of events . Reuters also reviewed and translated tweets from the period immediately before he went into hiding , which confirmed he was a target of intimidation , as well as contemporaneous news reports of his detentions . <p> " WATER IS A BIG DEAL " <p> Madani , now 39 , was born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with parents who lectured him on the importance of managing and preserving water . They both worked for a government agency that manages water resources in Iran , a nation that includes arid and dusty grasslands , snowy mountains , hot and humid coastal plains and lush , rainy forests . <p> He took their passion with him to university , making it his focus while other students were still trying to find their path . <p> " He was always explaining to people that ... water is a big deal , " said Ali Mirchi , a fellow civil engineering student at the University of Tabriz who now teaches at Oklahoma State University . " And it 's already a big deal " in Iran . " It 's going to be a big deal around the world . " <p> Residents salvage their belongings from the rubble of a damaged house in the aftermath of Cyclone Amphan , in South 24 Parganas district in the eastern state of West Bengal , India , May 22 , 2020 . Reuters <p> After earning his undergraduate civil engineering degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Sweden . From there , Madani went to America , where he earned a doctorate at the University of California , Davis . He later joined Imperial College London , teaching water management and game theory -- a method of analysing problems based on the available choices that each participant in the game has . <p> In several papers , Madani has taken those principles and applied them to water use problems . A simple example would be a farmer who needs water for irrigation and a developer who needs water for new homes . Both have water needs , and there 's enough for both if they take moderate steps to reduce their use . But if they distrust each other , they 'll grab more water than they need , depleting the supply for everyone . <p> Madani says these are the type of problems that governments are most qualified to equitably resolve by ensuring everyone keeps to the deal . And it 's this type of work where he feels he can make the biggest difference , bridging the gap between science , communities , government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not a hammer for all nails . But it is a technique that helps him find solutions . <p> " It 's the mathematics of cooperation and conflict , " he said . " You can use it to either project the likely outcomes of conflict situations or decision-making situations , or to consult and advise and come up with strategies to get the result that you want . " <p> His primary area of study is managing freshwater , without which most life on land could n't exist . But as the planet warms with climate change , some parts of the Earth are seeing less rainfall , and water has become more precious . Iran is one of those places . <p> Water resources are a tricky subject in Iran given the government 's role in their management . But Madani has not been shy about publicly criticising the government . <p> In 2016 , before his return , he and his old roommate at the University of Tabriz , Mirchi , and another scientist wrote a paper -- a follow-up to one Madani published in 2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agencies for what they described as " water bankruptcy . " Mismanagement had caused lakes , rivers and wetlands to dry up and resulted in desertification and more frequent dust storms , they said . Madani says the Iranian government hides those failures behind the excuse of climate change , which has indeed led to hotter summers and less rainfall . <p> " This makes the problem very tricky , especially for people like me who work in developing countries , " Madani said . " Because we have to warn about climate change and make sure climate change is recognised as a serious threat , but at the same time make sure that governments do n't misuse climate change . " <p> The 2016 paper was a direct challenge to the government . But some reform-minded officials at the Department of the Environment still wanted him to return to the fold , despite objections from hard-liners , he said . In September 2017 , he left his burgeoning academic career behind and returned home to take the job as deputy vice president with responsibilities that included international affairs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one of the most visible members of the Iranian diaspora to return to work with the government . It was a big deal . Here was a Western-educated , YouTube-posting , Twitter-cognoscenti member of the post-revolution generation coming home to help the country . <p> He was appointed as Iran 's delegate to various climate negotiations and was given a diplomatic passport . In November 2017 , he represented Iran at the COP23 climate-change implementation meetings in Bonn , Germany . The next month , he traveled to Paris for the anniversary of the 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change . Many countries were represented by prime ministers and presidents at both gatherings . Madani represented Iran . <p> At home , Madani quickly made an impact , said a water specialist colleague in Iran . He used social media to recruit actors , politicians and even some clerics to environmental causes , most notably to discourage single-use plastic containers . <p> People make their way to a safer place before the cyclone Amphan makes its landfall in Gabura outskirts of Satkhira district , Bangladesh May 20 , 2020 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials over projects that moved water from one area of the country to another , which Madani says was damaging the environment where the water was drawn . <p> " In conferences , as a speaker , he was very outspoken , " said the specialist , who spoke on the condition of anonymity . " He criticised people and officials . He tried to change their behaviour . " <p> At the time , the colleague was hopeful that Madani 's return signalled that Iran was ready to deal with some of its chronic water problems . Madani and his associates , he said , had plans to create a centre for monitoring water resources and forecasting droughts . <p> But trouble was brewing . " The system had not handled a case like me , " Madani said . " There were so many stories about reversing the brain drain and bringing the young generation back that they had a hard time getting rid of me or fully trusting me . " <p> When he first arrived in Iran , intelligence officers with the Revolutionary Guard detained and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accused him of conspiring with other countries , including Israel , he said . The officers also confiscated his computer and phone , Madani said . <p> He suspects they hacked into his Gmail account and downloaded 14 years of emails -- later using them on the day of his flight to Istanbul . Reuters was unable to determine who hacked Madani 's photographs and posted the denunciations on Twitter . Madani said he knows it was them because he could n't get into his email and had to ask his interrogators for his new password . <p> There was another arrest and several interrogations in the intervening months between his return to Iran in September 2017 and his decision to flee , but he was released each time . When he was last arrested , in February 2018 , authorities also detained eight Iranian environmentalists working to protect the endangered Asiatic cheetah . One of the eight died in custody . Iranian officials said Kavous Seyed Emami , a Canadian-Iranian who was one of the founders of the Persian Wildlife Heritage Foundation , had killed himself . His family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been sentenced to prison on charges of conspiring with a foreign country or spying . <p> On his flight to Istanbul a little later that same year , Madani decided that his patrons had lost the internal battle . His colleagues in Iran were crushed . Their plans for a water-resources centre were scrapped when Madani left . " The day he went from Iran , it was so dark a day for me , " the water specialist said . <p> Suzanne Maloney , an Iran scholar now at the Brookings Institution , was at the US State Department when Madani worked for the Iranian government and followed his efforts and difficulties through news accounts and other sources . Like Madani , Emami and others , expatriate Iranians have returned to Iran to serve their country only to find themselves locked up , she said . <p> " I think Kaveh Madani was very lucky to get out of Iran without a worse outcome than he suffered , " she said . " And I 'm sure it was a very harrowing experience . " <p> Bangladesh scientist Huq @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he and Madani had seen each other episodically through the years . Still , Huq did n't know what happened to Madani in Iran until September 2019 , 18 months after Madani went into hiding , when the two bumped into each other at a UN summit on climate change in New York . <p> Madani 's fate , he said , was n't surprising , given the limits on criticism of the government . <p> " If the space for critics is very limited , it 's almost impossible for us to function . " <p> CHALLENGES IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD <p> Huq said a bigger problem for climate scientists in the developing world is the lack of funding for research . <p> For example , the 2014 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessment report mentioned Bangladesh more than 100 times , citing scores of academic papers , Huq said . But only a quarter of the lead authors of those papers were working in his country . <p> Climate change causes acute problems for those living in the developing world , whether water shortages or failed crops . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by digging new , deeper wells , limiting irrigation or reusing sewerage to make potable water . <p> After all , Madani argues , most of those countries can do little to meaningfully reduce emissions anyway . With the exception of richer developing countries , including India , Saudi Arabia and even Iran , most developing nations are tiny emitters of greenhouse gases , so even if they eliminated all fossil fuels , it would do little to help deal with the consequences of climate change . <p> In Iran , Madani says that combating the effects of climate change and other environmental problems is complicated by Iran 's volatile relationship with the United States and some of its neighbours , such as archrival Saudi Arabia . <p> Consider the international sanctions against Iran , put in place at various times by the United States , its allies and the United Nations to punish Iran for shipping attacks in the Persian Gulf , supporting international terrorism and its pursuit of nuclear weapons . In November , Madani published a paper examining how the sanctions are hitting the Iranian environment particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the MacMillan Center for International and Area Studies , walks through campus at Yale University in New Haven , Connecticut , US , January 28 , 2020 . Reuters <p> For example , exporting refined petroleum products to Iran has been illegal for decades . So , Iran developed its own crude oil refineries . The result is dirty , polluting fuels that run dirty , polluting electrical power plants . <p> Likewise , exporting cars to Iran is also illegal . So , Iran developed its own car industry . The result is inefficient cars . <p> The sanctions also allow the Iranian government to blame the West reflexively for Iran 's problems , said Maloney , the Iran scholar , when internal factors such as corruption or mismanagement are at play . <p> " I think that 's symptomatic of the Islamic Republic 's approach to all of its internal problems , to find some external party to blame for them , " she said . <p> RICH VS . POOR <p> Like Madani , Huq studied and taught overseas . Today , he heads up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University in Dhaka , Bangladesh . <p> He says there 's a distinct difference between climate change research in Europe and North America and the work being done in developing countries , such as Bangladesh . <p> Scientists in the West are good at working on technological solutions to climate change , such as solar technology or carbon-dioxide scrubbing systems . <p> He said scientists in poor countries such as Bangladesh rarely have enough money or expertise to do that kind of research . Besides , some of the worst effects of climate change , including longer droughts , dangerous heat waves , rising sea levels and more dangerous tropical cyclones , will almost certainly hit the developing world harder . <p> " The richer countries have the ability to develop and then bring hardware to countries like ours and install it with just a screwdriver , " he said , referring to devices such as modern windmills and solar panels . And that 's all well and good , he said , " but I would argue that the poor actually know a lot more about how to deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . " <p> Bangladesh , for example , has adapted to the growing threat of tropical cyclones . <p> " In the past decades , we have had super cyclones which have killed hundreds of thousands . We had one in 1970 that killed half a million people . " <p> Last year , Super Cyclone Amphan developed over the Bay of Bengal and rapidly developed into one of the region 's largest recorded storms . But when it struck the Indian and Bangladeshi coast on May 20 , only 128 people died , including 26 in Bangladesh . <p> " In the last decade , we have built the world 's best cyclone warning and shelter system , " he said . " Instead of hundreds of thousands of people dying , the number was in the dozens . <p> " The cyclone still happened . It still did a lot of damage . Houses , infrastructure , people lost their homes and their farms . But they did n't die . " <p> It happened that way because scientists persuaded the nation 's leaders that the threat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , evacuation and shelter plan , based on the best available research . <p> Lives were also saved by children knocking on doors . <p> " Kids went to different households and brought the widows and the mothers who do n't have anybody to help them , " Huq said . " The kids made sure that their own grandparents go to the shelter . " <p> Sometimes so-called solutions to climate change are less effective -- and can even exacerbate the problem , Madani said . <p> When he was in Florida , Madani teamed up with one of his students , Saeed Hadian , a fellow Iranian , to examine the consequences of using alternative energy sources as demand for electricity increases and countries move away from fossil fuels . <p> Where there is plenty of unused land , acres of solar panels might make sense . In other places , where agriculture needs the land , nuclear power or offshore wind farms might be a better solution , Hadian argued . <p> California , for example , gets nearly a fifth of its power from hydroelectric dams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evaporation that could otherwise be used for farming and drinking . By comparison , less water is used or polluted when extracting natural gas and coal from the ground and used in power plants than is lost to evaporation . <p> Madani is n't advocating the burning of coal , of course ; his point is that some low- or zero-carbon choices -- such as dams -- can have unintended consequences for climate change , the environment and ecosystems . For some countries , the threat to water supplies posed by a hydroelectric dam might mean a natural-gas or nuclear power plant makes more sense . <p> Madani says it 's worse in North Africa and the Middle East , where governments have been building dams for decades as a cheap and clean source of electricity . <p> " Hydropower is not a good idea , but most politicians love it , " he said . " You sell it as renewable ; you sell it as clean . And it comes with a lot of concrete . And it 's really good for the local economy , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast amounts of water are lost to evaporation . Demand for water around the dam almost always increases , and in regions seeing less rain because of climate change , it also starves downstream farmers , sometimes thousands of miles away in different countries , of water needed for irrigation . <p> " Beware of unintended consequences , " Madani said . <p> DROPPING OFF THE HOT LIST <p> In the months after he stepped off that plane in Istanbul , Madani was officially listed as a visiting professor at Imperial College London . In reality , he had gone into hiding . <p> Relying on old friends for help , he made his way from Turkey through Europe to North America . But even after Madani made it across the Atlantic , he did n't feel safe . He spent about eight months bouncing between the United States , where he 's a permanent resident , and Toronto , where his wife had lived before they married . He did interviews and spoke at conferences , but no place was home . <p> In January 2020 , he felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Yale University 's MacMillan Center for International and Area Studies and split his time between the New Haven campus and Toronto . <p> Madani ranked 684th on the Reuters Hot List in mid-2019 . By December 2020 , however , he had dropped off the list . That 's because he was publishing less as he sought a haven . Even since joining Yale , he has n't published as much as he once did . <p> " There have been a lot of papers and invitations to join teams that I 've said no to , because I was doing other things or I thought that what they 're saying is too theoretical and has no major policy implications or impact , " he said . <p> Madani plans to stay in academia but wants to do more in the lay world , where he can talk to the public , both in the West and Iran . He remains a prolific Farsi tweeter , sometimes criticising , sometimes defending Iran . He 's also published opinion pieces , on subjects including smog in his hometown of Tehran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journals . <p> The COVID-19 pandemic has clipped his wings too . He was already worried about traveling because of threats from Iran , but his travel is now nonexistent , and he 's reduced to streaming video presentations . He keeps in touch with his aging parents back in Iran , now in their 70s , via WhatsApp . His father recently suffered serious health problems , and the separation is particularly hard to bear . <p> So his mother was excited when UCLA 's Center for Near East Studies streamed a conversation in Farsi with Madani in October on how Iran struggles with drought , water shortages and other environmental problems resulting from climate change , mismanagement , development and politics . <p> But during the presentation , which was carried on an Instagram live feed , his mother scrolled through the comments . The organised Madani haters were back , some of them attacking him by crudely insulting her . 
@@87998233 <h> 20 years on , the war on terror grinds along with no end in sight <p> FILE -- Opposition soldiers and volunteers stand on the streets and fire into the air in Brega , eastern Libya , on March 12 , 2011 . The Libyan conflict is one of the success stories of the war on terror . ( Lynsey Addario/The New York Times ) <h> When President Joe Biden told an exhausted nation on Aug 31 that the last C-17 cargo plane had left Taliban-controlled Kabul , ending two decades of American military misadventure in Afghanistan , he defended the frantic , bloodstained exit with a simple statement : " I was not going to extend this forever war . " <p> And yet the war grinds on . <p> As Biden drew the curtain on Afghanistan , the CIA was quietly expanding a secret base deep in the Sahara , from which it runs drone flights to monitor al-Qaida and Islamic State group militants in Libya , as well as extremists in Niger , Chad and Mali . The military 's Africa Command resumed drone strikes against the Shabab , an al-Qaida-linked group in Somalia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forces trainers back to Somalia to help local troops fight militants . <p> Even in Kabul itself , a fiery drone strike on men believed to be Islamic State plotters targeting the airport portended a future of military operations there . The attack , which the Pentagon called a " righteous strike " to avert another deadly suicide bombing , showcased America 's " over-the-horizon " capabilities , to use a phrase favoured by Biden . Family members denied that the men being targeted were militants and said the strike killed 10 people , seven of them children . <p> Twenty years after 9/11 , the so-called war on terror shows no sign of winding down . It waxes and wanes , largely in the shadows and out of the headlines -- less an epochal clash than a low-grade condition , one that flares up occasionally , as in 2017 , when Islamic State group militants ambushed American and local soldiers outside a village in Niger , killing four Americans . <p> Taking stock of this war is difficult because it is inseparable from the twin calamities of Afghanistan and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the tactics of counterterrorism for a more ambitious , ill-fated project to remake fractured , tribal societies into American-style democracies . <p> Those failures are etched in the shameful images of prisoners at Abu Ghraib in Iraq or of desperate Afghans falling from the belly of an American plane . They are documented in the deaths of more than 7,000 American service members , hundreds of thousands of civilians and trillions of squandered American dollars . <p> The counterterrorism war , much of it waged covertly , defies such metrics . More and more of it involves partners . Large parts of it occur in distant places such as the Sahel or the Horn of Africa . American casualties , for the most part , are limited . And success is measured not by capturing a capital or destroying an enemy 's army , but by breaking up groups before they have a chance to strike the American homeland or overseas assets such as embassies and military bases . <p> By that yardstick , say counterterrorism experts , the war on terror has been an undisputed success . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have only 100 people killed by jihadi terrorism and only one foreign terrorist attack in the United States over the next 20 years , you 'd have been laughed out of the room , " said Daniel Benjamin , the State Department 's coordinator for counterterrorism in the Obama administration . <p> " The fact that it had to be accompanied by two wars makes it hard for people to disaggregate how successful counterterrorism policies have been , " said Benjamin , now president of the American Academy in Berlin . <p> There are other explanations for the lack of a major foreign attack : tighter border security and the ubiquity of the internet , which has made it easier to track and disrupt jihadi movements ; or the upheavals of the Arab Spring , which shifted the sights of extremists to their own societies . <p> Nor is it accurate to say that the West has been shielded from the scourge of terrorism .

Between 2018 and 2020 , the United States was engaged in some form of counterterrorism activity in 85 countries , according to the Costs of War Project at Brown University . <p> American forces were involved in combat , either directly or through proxies , in 12 countries , including Iraq , Kenya , Mali , Nigeria , Somalia , Syria , Yemen and Afghanistan . The United States has had the legal authority to conduct special operations in Cameroon , Libya , Niger and Tunisia . It carried out air or drone strikes in seven countries : Afghanistan , Iraq , Libya , Pakistan , Somalia , Syria and Yemen . <p> US troops have conducted counterterrorism training exercises in 41 countries . And the United States has trained the military , police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Stephanie Savell , co-director of the project , at Brown 's Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs . <p> While the pace of some activities slowed during the pandemic , she said , " Biden is doubling down on these far-flung operations . " <p> The melting away of the American-trained Afghan army in the face of the Taliban 's advance has cast a shadow over the concept of working with local partners , as did the wholesale retreat of Iraqi troops from Islamic State fighters , who briefly succeeded in establishing a caliphate over much of Iraq and Syria in 2014 and organised terror networks in Europe . <p> But there are other examples where the United States , with more realistic ambitions and limited goals , has been able to forge fruitful partnerships with local militias . Syrian Kurdish fighters , aided by US troops , evicted the Islamic State group from Syria , while Libyan militias , helped by US airstrikes , uprooted Islamic State fighters from their base in the Libyan city of Sirte . <p> " These were urban strongholds where you had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cragin , a senior research fellow in counterterrorism at the National Defense University . " And these were not 20-year missions ; more like six-month missions . " <p> Between law enforcement cooperation , military training and the sharing of intelligence , the war on terror has been one of the better examples of multilateralism in recent decades . Unlike , say , the economic competition with China , the United States and its allies have stayed remarkably in sync about the imperative of fighting terrorism since the week after 9/11 , when NATO invoked Article 5 , the principle of collective self-defence , for the first and only time in its history . <p> " One of the biggest successes in the war on terror is the one we take the most for granted -- the close bonds with our allies , " said Bruce Hoffman , a counterterrorism expert at Georgetown University . " We could always count on being on the same page with them on counterterrorism . " <p> How America 's chaotic departure from Afghanistan will affect those relationships is anybody 's guess . Hoffman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of consultation with European allies , which has angered political leaders , would filter down into the intelligence ranks . <p> For all the efforts to portray the US mission as humane and morally just , the long years of bloodshed disillusioned allies and hardened adversaries . Some American operations , such as those in the West African country of Burkina Faso , not only failed to stamp out extremism but may have inadvertently worsened it . <p> The flip side of collaboration is that the United States lashed itself to unsavoury players , from Saudi Arabia , with its heavy-handed intervention in Yemen , to Egypt , which has carried out a brutal crackdown on its domestic opponents in the name of fighting extremism . <p> At home , the political consensus that undergirded the war on terror is fracturing , a casualty of America 's extreme polarisation . Some Republicans called for Biden to be impeached after the suicide attack at Kabul 's airport that killed 13 service members -- something that would have been impossible to imagine happening to George W Bush after 9/11 . <p> Trump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have been scathing in their criticism of Biden , never mind that they negotiated the deal with the Taliban that pressured the Afghan government to release 5,000 prisoners of war and set the clock ticking for the US withdrawal in 2021 . <p> " Counterterrorism was always a bipartisan issue , " Hoffman said . " But both major parties now have deep internal divisions over it . Leaders are playing to the constituency that they believe is the strongest . " <p> Biden 's Shifting Positions <p> Biden was present at the creation of the war on terror . In January 2002 , weeks after the United States ousted the Taliban , he became the highest-ranking American politician to visit the battlefield . After touring a bombed-out Kabul , he said the United States should take part in a multinational military force to restore order . <p> " I 'm talking about a multilateral force with orders to shoot to kill , " said Biden , who was then chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee . " Absent that , I do n't see any hope for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Biden became disenchanted with the corruption of its pro-Western leaders and sceptical that the United States could ever unify its warring tribes . He became the administration 's leading naysayer on the use of military force , opposing the troop surge in Afghanistan and the NATO intervention in Libya , and even advising against the commando raid that killed Osama bin Laden . <p> Now , having fulfilled his promise to leave Afghanistan , it falls to Biden to articulate the next chapter of the war on terror to a country that has tired of the subject . Americans are far more preoccupied with the coronavirus or the wildfires and flash floods that are a byproduct of climate change . <p> " My biggest concern is that the FDA has not approved vaccines for kids under 12 , " said Cragin , referring to the US Food and Drug Administration . " The fact that my mom 's biggest concern when she goes to a movie theatre is not a terrorist attack is a good thing . " <p> Biden has indicated he is open to updating one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorised the president to wage war on those responsible for the attacks . It has been stretched beyond recognition to justify military action against all sorts of new enemies . Biden has also imposed limits on drone strikes and commando operations , pending a review . <p> The president 's matter-of-fact language is not unlike that of his old boss , Obama . He speaks of diffuse threats from al-Shabab in Somalia ; al-Qaida affiliates in Syria and Yemen ; and Islamic State spinoffs in Africa and Asia . America 's " over-the-horizon " capabilities , he said , would enable it " to strike terrorists and targets without American boots on the ground -- or very few , if needed . " <p> It is a stark contrast to Bush , who coined the phrase " global war on terror . " In the feverish aftermath of 9/11 , he framed the battle in Manichaean terms , not just as a law enforcement or counterterrorism challenge , but as a twilight struggle between good and evil . <p> " Why do they hate us ? " Bush asked a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see right here in this chamber : a democratically elected government . Their leaders are self-appointed . They hate our freedoms : our freedom of religion , our freedom of speech , our freedom to vote and assemble . " <p> As the war on terror enters its third decade -- some have taken to calling it the post-post-9/11 era -- American presidents no longer cast the battle in existential terms . The defining contest of 2021 , Biden has said , is between open societies and the autocrats in Moscow and Beijing . <p> The question is whether a divided , distracted United States will have the resources or patience to maintain an effective counterterrorism policy . The White House still has not appointed a counterterrorism coordinator in the State Department , an important post for an administration keen on nonmilitary solutions . <p> If the war on terror helped prevent another deadly foreign attack on American soil , it utterly failed to prevent the proliferation of terrorist groups . With the triumph of the Taliban , these new fighters have fresh inspiration to fix their sights on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We ca n't have another 9/11 because our security is so much better , ' " Hoffman said . " But terrorists are the ultimate opportunists . They 're always looking for opportunities . "
