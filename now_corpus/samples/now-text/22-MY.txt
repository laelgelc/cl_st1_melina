Three hundred and sixty-five days waiting for us to fill and fulfil their promise . <p> Time , then , for a sweet start to 2022 . <p> I 'm not thinking about desserts , however . Certainly not bread , not yet . ( I 've overdosed on baked goods in 2021 , that 's for sure . ) <p> No , it 's still something savoury I long for . A main dish , rather than a side . Something we can enjoy with our family and friends or enjoy alone . ( If there 's anything the past two years of the pandemic have taught us , it 's that staying safe is worth celebrating ; being solitary does n't equal solitude . ) <p> New Year always reminds me of noodles . Perhaps it 's the longevity noodles we have during the Lunar New Year or on our birthdays . Either way , it 's a symbol of a long life ; hopefully one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves are n't enough . Let our lives be long and let them be sweet , full of love and kindness . Brimming with joy . <p> A new year also means another batch of resolutions , typically to be healthier -- to hit the gym and to eat clean . Less sugar , then . <p> There are other ways to add sweetness to your food -- and your life . <p> Ripe , juicy mango adds a fruity sweetness to your noodles . <p> Here , I 've decided on a bolognese or rag ? base . To sweeten the meat-and-tomato sauce , instead of adding sugar or cloying honey , how about some ripe mangoes and roasted garlic ? The first offers a fruity sweetness ; the latter a deeper , more caramelised flavour . <p> You can make your own roasted garlic ahead of time . <p> Cooked down with the minced meat and chopped tomatoes , it will look just like any other rag ? . Till you take your first bite , that is . <p> A startled look , your eyes widening , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> You take a second bite , then another . Before you know it , you have polished your plate . Could you have another plate , you wonder . <p> That 's the sweetest life ; when you find yourself asking for seconds .

Partly for a change -- the mouthfeel of pasta , its inherent al dente nature when cooked correctly , suggest firmer footing in the coming months -- and partly because dry pasta was what I had in the pantry . <p> In lieu of traditional Chinese noodles , you may use Italian dried pasta such as tagliatelle and pappardelle . <p> If the legend of Marco Polo has any truth to it , the Italians got their pasta from the adventurer 's return with Chinese noodles from his journey to the Far East anyway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I could n't speak to , I 'm sure . <p> Aside from the noodles or pasta , other ingredients are there for a reason : to add sweetness to this long , happy life . <p> Chinese sausage ( left ) .

A few cubes of Chinese sausage contribute a nice chew to the sauce . <p> Ginger ( left ) . Shallots ( right ) . <p> The mangoes and the roasted garlic for the unexpected notes of sweetness , of course , but also other aromatics such as shallots and ginger give the sauce more depth .

Because one tends to reject or remain ignorant of the least desirable aspects of one 's personality , the shadow is largely negative . <p> " Everyone carries a shadow and the less it is embodied in the individual 's conscious life , the blacker and denser it is , " wrote Carl Jung , the Swiss psychiatrist and psychoanalyst who founded analytical psychology . <p> Since the shadow is the unknown dark side of the personality , it can be instinctive and irrational . Therefore , it is prone to psychological projection , in which perceived personal inferiority is recognised as a perceived moral deficiency in someone else . <p> Facing the shadow <p> According to the book Meeting the Shadow : The Hidden Power of the Dark Side of Human Nature by Connie Zweig and Jeremiah Abrams , shadow work involves facing your lost self , false self , and disowned self @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your being that you had to repress because of the demands of society , the ' false self ' is the facade you created in order to fill the void created by repression and lack of adequate nurturing , while the ' disowned self ' is the negative parts of your false self that met with disapproval and were therefore denied . <p> One way or another , our shadow side will find its way to the surface . If we keep attempting to postpone sitting with our feelings , they will barge in , uninvited , and at random for a sense of relief from the internal pressure of keeping it all in . <p> It can range from us blowing up on someone who does n't deserve it , to shelving ideas for our dream project because we never address the underlying notion that we do n't think we 're good enough . <p> By confronting our fear , we consciously make a safe space for our inner havoc and it will be one of the most liberating experiences we could hope for when we feel the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triggered us with grace and composure . <p> When we learn to sit with our demons instead of shaming them into hiding , we have a more gentle and effective approach to our life . <p> Instead of being at the mercy of others ' projections , we need to become aware .

Everyone now is designing with nature , reducing cutting of trees , but we are still building on top of floodwater retention ponds , " she said . <p> Shuhana was referring to recent news reports where Segambut MP Hannah Yeoh brought up an issue of six flood water retention ponds in Kuala Lumpur that had received approval from the Kuala Lumpur City Hall ( DBKL ) for development . <p> This was cited in the Auditor-General 's ( A-G ) Report 2019 Series 2 which revealed that the KL mayor had approved 943 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Kuala Lumpur City Plan . <p> The A-G 's report also stated that the change in zoning of land use and density had an impact on the environment which led to reduction of open space , flash floods and traffic congestion . <p> How to design better ? <p> " Now we have flooding as a problem for the city , before we had Covid-19 where it showed us that we need more open space to prevent crowding . <p> " Now we need open space to help divert excess water from heavy downpour and at the same time , the current trend all over the world is that people are going for water-sensitive urban design , " she said . <p> Shuhana explained that water sensitive urban design means that cities are designed with the consideration of creating spaces that can actually absorb excess water from the rain , acting like sponges for the city for the extra water that comes from the rain . <p> " When there is more open space , this will minimise the amount of tarmac that is blocking the water from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could also consider other methods of stormwater management , such as canal systems which can receive the extra water , " she said adding that , this is what the government is not doing in the country because they are focused on maximising use of land for buildings . <p> She pointed out that there are studies which indicate that Malaysia is actually made of cities which are surrounded by either the river or sea . <p> " Malaysia is actually a country with many waterfront cities .

@@43826240 <h> After pandemic and floods , is Malaysia prepared for a cyber attack ? <h> Share this article <p> LOOKING at the response of the government agencies tasked to handle the outbreak of Covid and the floods that devastated the country , it appears that if there was a cyber attack against Malaysia , the people will again suffer from the incompetence of the government agencies tasked to identify , monitor and manage such a threat . <p> For hackers , Malaysia and other Asean countries are low-hanging fruit and testing grounds , unlike developed countries , which generally have more advanced defences against hacking . <p> The government should not deny the poor state of the Malaysian cyberspace . The agencies tasked to monitor , investigate and maintain the country 's cyber preparedness will no doubt argue that the cyber security level in the country is above average and in many instances better that that of developed countries .

There is nothing wrong with public servants dabbling in the stock market . <p> But , here we have you saying RM330,000 worth of shares , which is still RM230,000 above what a public servant is allowed to have , and you seem okay with this . <p> You have terrible math skills .

I also remember that Malaysia hosted a soir ? e one evening where typical Malaysian dishes and delicacies were served , and some cultural performances presented . <p> The soir ? e proved to be a huge success with many attendees coming for the event .

@@43999238 <p> THE Year of the Tiger roared in with increased tiger sightings , yet our Malayan tiger numbers are reportedly fewer than 150 . The recent appearance of tigers roaming outside forest fringes indicates that human-tiger conflict issues need to be addressed urgently . What we do now will determine the survival of tigers in the wild in Malaysia and globally . <p> On a positive development , the World Wide Fund 's ( WWF ) latest report on tiger conservation has shown a reversal in the centuries-long trend of wild tiger decline . This marked a rare and hard-fought conservation success story for several tiger-range countries in Asia . <p> The report entitled , " WWF 's Impact on Tiger Recovery 2010-2022 " , highlights the efforts of tiger-range countries , including Malaysia , in preventing the decline of their wild tiger population since the Global Tiger Summit in 2010 . Notably , it was during this summit that these nations pledged to double their tiger population by 2022 -- a pledge known as " TX2 " . <p> How countries worked to restore tigers over the last 12 years : <p> 1 . Tackling snaring crisis <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Project Stampede , which drastically increased the number of patrol teams formed by people from the local indigenous communities . These teams carried out patrols , removed snares and collated data on poaching . They have reduced active snares in the Belum-Temengor Forest Complex by an incredible 94% . Increased funding and patrol teams are a positive step towards conserving Malaysia 's tigers but more needs to be done to prevent this glimmer of hope from fading . <p> 2 . Connecting tigers across borders <p> In the Russian Far East lies the Land of the Leopard National Park , a protected area and wildlife corridor that secures the main route for tigers moving across the border to China 's Northeast China Amur Tiger and Leopard National Park . Not only have tiger numbers tripled in this national park after a decade of conservation efforts , but the connectivity is enabling tigers to move between both countries . <p> 3 . Community-based conservation <p> WWF partners with local people in Nepal to become resource managers , beneficiaries and stewards of the forests in which they live . Nepal 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts of the local community . The functional corridor is also home to tigers , which are free to roam between the forests of Nepal and India . <p> 4 . Tackling illegal trade <p> WWF and TRAFFIC ( Wildlife Trade Monitoring Network ) have worked to facilitate government-led cooperation to break the India-China-Nepal tiger trade chain through improved transboundary wildlife law enforcement and coordination . Nepal 's National Wildlife Crime Control Coordination Committee was created to facilitate national multi-agency cooperation across police , customs and intelligence departments , with a similar model to India 's National Wildlife Crime Control bureau . <p> 5 . Expanding range <p> As tiger populations have recovered , researchers have started seeing them in new areas . In 2020 , the high altitude record of a tiger sighting was broken twice in Nepal -- creating excitement about the prospect of tigers claiming new ground . The second high altitude sighting in Ilam increased the known tiger range in Nepal east by an incredible 200km . This is credit to the remarkable efforts of the government and communities in tiger landscapes over the last decade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little hope for tigers in the west of India 's Rajaji Tiger Reserve until a translocation bringing tigers back to the area launched in 2020 . There had been no signs of breeding in the reserve since 2006 and the reintroduction of new tigers aims to change this . The process to translocate tigers requires a long time commitment with extensive planning that also relies on strong political will and social support . <p> 7 . Rewilding <p> Kazakhstan 's story on the other hand is very different . Tigers became extinct in the country over 70 years ago and a landmark effort is under way to return this iconic big cat to the country by 2025 . It will take at least 15 years , and include three key stages : First , habitat preparation which started in 2018 , and will last until 2024 . Second is the tiger reintroduction phase which will last another nine years , until 2033 . And finally monitoring will start in 2025 and continue for at least 15 years . At least 10 tigers will be translocated in this period and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support 120 tigers . <p> 8 . Supporting rangers <p> The " SMART Patrol " approach is used worldwide and supports rangers in their efforts to protect wildlife from poachers and other threats . Data such as wildlife sightings and illegal activity are logged through the SMART app and are then used to help rangers adapt their patrols based on the location of threats . Since 2012 , thanks to the help of SMART and other conservation measures , tiger numbers in Bhutan 's Royal Manas National Park have doubled -- an incredible and hard fought conservation success . <p> 9 . Human-tiger coeixtence <p> In India 's Pilibhit Tiger Reserve Bagh Mitras -- volunteer community response teams -- have been trained to provide support in human-tiger conflict situations , understanding tiger behaviour , and pugmark identification . Their role is to provide support to local authorities and communities in preventing or responding to conflict situations when they arise . <p> 10 . Restoring habitat <p> Thailand is a leader in the Southeast Asia region for effectively managing its tiger sites . WWF-Thailand has partnered with the Thai Department of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to support the long-term recovery of both tiger and prey populations . Together , they are restoring important grazing areas and setting up artificial salt licks to supply wildlife with vital minerals . Three different tiger prey species have already benefited from these interventions -- muntjac , sambar deer , and gaur -- an important step towards tiger recovery . <p> 11 . Conservation tools <p> Another piece of innovation that is supporting countries in their efforts to protect tigers is the Conservation Assured Tiger Standards ( CATS ) . Being CATS approved shows that effectively managing a site according to best practices enables tiger conservation and where possible , population recovery . In 2020 , the Indian government adopted CATS across the country 's 50 Tiger Reserves , which contain over 60% of the world 's tiger population . <p> 12 . Sustainable finance <p> Through the Bhutan for Life project , the government , supported by WWF-Bhutan , has been securing a network of effectively managed and sustainably financed protected areas across the country . This is protecting tiger movement corridors but also key high-biodiversity and climate resilient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sept 5 , tiger range countries will converge at the second Global Tiger Summit in Vladivostok , Russia where it will be revealed whether the TX2 goal has been achieved . The countries will renew their commitment to protecting tigers as governments set their goals for the next 12 years . <p> While there have been major conservation successes over the last 12 years in tiger range countries , the work is far from over . <p> At the national level , WWF-Malaysia has relentlessly supported the establishment of the National Tiger Task Force , Tigers Working Group and Wildlife Crime Bureau . Now that they have been set up , we will continue pushing for the implementation of the next phase of tiger conservation . <p> Tiger conservation in Malaysia may seem like an uphill battle with our wild tiger numbers down to fewer than 150 .

I count that as 15 " Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DAP winners ) . This is to say that the Chinese reps / Chinese parties make up 26% of the 56 member Johor State Assembly . 26% is slightly higher than the percentage of Chinese in the population .

Hence the following stats : <p> The voter turnout was indeed low . About 50+% . Only 599,999 voted for the BN or 42% of the turnout . Or 23% of the total voters . So just one quarter of the total registered voters can determine the future of Johor . <p> Lucky shot : The other Malay votes were split among the circus of Malay opposition parties . Macam Melayu baru belajar buat parti . Amanah , Bersatu , Pejuang , Pas and to an extent PKR and Muda . Pas , PKR , Amanah and Muda won one seat each -- which I term as lucky .

@@44154231 <p> What 's wrong with Pakatan Harapan ? This is one question that can beg dozens of answers , some complementary while others contradictory . Here is mine , for your consideration alongside those that put heavy emphasis on personalities and communalism . <p> As this is not answering " what 's right with Harapan " , I will not list its achievements . Do n't misconstrue that Harapan has achieved nothing or complain that this does not do it justice . <p> In hindsight , nearly four years after GE14 , Harapan 's fundamental failure is its inability to understand , steer , and adapt to political transformation . <p> This failure contributed to its fall in the Sheraton Move but more damagingly , disables it from making a comeback after Sheraton . <p> Handicaps as a product of history <p> Many are disappointed with Harapan 's performance in its brief 22 months in power but such disappointment , while legitimate , must be examined against this question : how likely can any first non-Umno government do better ? <p> Could Harapan appoint a better cabinet with more experienced and competent ministers ? Difficult . A parliamentary system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party hierarchy matters . <p> Unless our Parliament had many parliamentary committees for opposition MPs ( and for that matter , backbenchers ) and the opposition had a shadow cabinet for its senior MPs to develop policy expertise , how do you expect most first-time ministers to perform excellently ? <p> ( The same applies to some incompetent first-term ministers under ex-premier Muhyiddin Yassin and current premier Ismail Sabri Yaakob . ) <p> Could Harapan avoid over-promising in its manifesto ? Difficult . Without actual experience in the federal government and shadow ministers to think through policy solutions , how could the opposition produce a manifesto that is both exciting and realistic ? <p> Could Dr Mahathir Mohamad , Anwar Ibrahim , and Azmin Ali not engage in a power struggle ? Yes but only if they were angels or saints . <p> Could Harapan not pick Mahathir as its prime minister candidate to avoid the subsequent fallout ? Yes , but then it might not have won enough Malay votes to oust Umno . Just look at how Harapan lost in Malacca and Johor to grasp this point . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tact , humility , and caution ? Yes . Would that be enough to stop Umno and PAS from playing up Malay anxiety ? No . <p> Asking the above questions is important because we need to separate what might be inevitable for any first non-Umno government from what Harapan could have done better . <p> Harapan is a product of history with its handicaps and limitations . To demand perfection is to say BN-Umno 's excesses should be tolerated no matter what . But this is not a blank cheque to excuse Harapan 's mistakes both in and out of power . <p> Mistake 1 : Nasty opposition could be broken up and eliminated <p> In GE14 , Harapan-Warisan won only 48 percent of votes , as the remaining 51 percent largely split between BN ( 33 percent ) and PAS ( 17 percent ) . <p> The victory was made possible by two factors , the Umno-PAS split of Malay votes and the record-high Chinese turnout . As both might not repeat in GE15 , many Harapan politicians feared that they would be only a " one-term government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger ? <p> The first was to break up and eliminate the nasty opposition . Since BN had built up excessive incumbent advantages -- in constituency allocation , parliamentary business , selective prosecution/impunity -- against the opposition , use them on the new opposition to weaken their base and induce their collapse . <p> The second would be the exact opposite -- levelling the playing field through parliamentary reform , equal constituency allocation , decentralisation , electoral system reform , and reform of the Attorney-General 's Chambers and MACC . <p> These reforms -- some were later implemented under the MOU -- would allow the opposition to survive and compete healthily on bread-and-butter issues and integrity , without necessarily playing up ethno-religious issues . <p> By reducing incumbent advantages , the second option was at least insurance . If Harapan loses Putrajaya in GE15 , it may still retain many states and Umno can not rebuild a corrupt one-party state . <p> Of course , the second option was not pursued , perhaps never seriously contemplated . Many Harapan leaders and supporters simply saw BN-Umno and PAS as corrupt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be winner-takes-all . Incentivising the opposition to behave benignly is simply na ? ve and stupid . <p> What 's the outcome of Option 1 ? Harapan increased its parliamentary seats from 121 to 139 ( despite losing the Tanjung Piai seat in a by-election ) , just nine seats short of a two-thirds parliamentary majority . <p> Harapan gained a total of 15 MPs from BN , 13 of them Umno defectors who ended up in Bersatu . In addition , BN also lost Sarawak BN ( now GPS ) and PBS which went independent with 19 and one seat respectively . <p> However , without the constraint of East Malaysians , Umno 's natural response was to team up with PAS in Muafakat Nasional , which constantly accused Harapan as the enemy and traitor of Malays . <p> This , and the bourgeoning relationship between Bersatu with Umno defectors that exacerbated the Mahathir-Anwar conflict , ended Harapan . <p> As executive dominance , centralisation , and patronage politics remained intact , Harapan subsequently lost six state governments through defection . <p> Mistake 2 : ' Counter-coups ' by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without incumbent advantages led Harapan to obsessively chase after any chance of regaining power by a ' counter-coup ' with government MP defections . <p> While Anwar 's " strong , formidable , and convincing " majority has become a defining joke of his desperation , the obsession was shared throughout all Harapan-plus parties . <p> In fact , many blamed Anwar , not for pursuing ' counter-coups ' , but for failing to deliver . <p> Realistically , how could the " counter-coups " be successful and sustainable ? Why would Umno parliamentarians topple a non-Umno PM from Bersatu to install a non-Umno PM from Harapan , as they would bound to be punished by Umno grassroots in GE15 ? <p> In Warisan president Mohd Shafie Apdal 's case , why would GPS install a prime minister from Sabah and miss their own chance ? <p> And if a Harapan 2.0 government counts on the support of Umno 's court cluster , would it not be punished by its own base , who are more reformist and independent-minded ? <p> What kind of " realists " would fantasise that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polls ? <p> Haunted by the fear of losing GE15 and possessed by an addiction to incumbent advantages , Harapan wasted every day post-Sheraton . <p> It refused to focus on governance and form a shadow cabinet to ' mark ' ( as in football ) ministers . Most tellingly , they could not table a shadow budget in 2020 after losing power , which it successfully did for seven years before winning power in 2018 . <p> In a crisis is danger and opportunity , but a directionless Harapan failed to turn the government 's crises into its own opportunities . <p> When the Muhyiddin government failed on the pandemic , no one saw a successful alternative in Harapan . When Ismail Sabri 's federal government failed on the floods , no one said Harapan 's Selangor state government was a success . <p> Mistake 3 : Voters can still be mobilised by anger <p> Harapan 's failure to offer superior and workable alternatives is caused by its addiction to both incumbent advantages and anger mobilisation . <p> The " Anything but Umno " ( ABU ) anger -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest since 1990 -- was simply resurrected as a rejection of " backdoor governments " after Sheraton . <p> The latest resurfaced label is " big tent " , the strategy that brought Harapan and Mahathir together for GE14 . <p> What Harapan failed to realise is that for many voters , anger has simply been disabled by fatigue . They may remain angry and distrustful of BN and Perikatan Nasional ( PN ) , but they have joined the largest party in town -- Parti Aku Tak Undi ( Patu ) . <p> Increasingly , voters will not respond to anger mobilisation for three reasons . <p> First , it makes them feel stupid when leaders realign rapidly . In Malacca , Harapan simply had no qualms taking Umno frogs after claiming victim to party-hopping . <p> Second , after Harapan 's 22 months , voters get realistic on what a new government can offer .

Even Perikatan Nasional did better ( 24.04% ) . As PKR 's Rafizi Ramli wryly noted , PH has become " the least preferred choice " for Malay voters . Even among non-Malay voters , support has slumped to new lows . It is not hard to fathom why . <p> Pakatan Harapan -- once a credible party with a credible agenda -- has lost its way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and agenda . It is no secret that both the DAP and Amanah have grown increasingly frustrated with Anwar Ibrahim 's leadership . Indeed , many , even in his own party , feel that it is time for him to step down but no one is willing to bell the cat . Lim Guan Eng 's cryptic remarks recently suggesting that Rafizi should challenge Anwar for the PKR presidency is as close as any PH leader has come to asking him to step down . <p> The distinct lack of loyalty to the common PH logo has also not gone down well . The DAP ditched the PH logo in the Sarawak state elections last December while Anwar opted to use his party logo in Johor . It is differences such as these that strengthen the impression that PH is in disarray . <p> As well , PH seems to be out of sync with the voters . In Johor , PH made Najib and stopping the court cluster the main issue ; voters were clearly more concerned with jobs , the rising cost of living , financial support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skilfully spoke to those concerns . His slick and savvy social media machine ran circles around PH . His demand that EPF contributors be allowed a further withdrawal of their savings was so widely popular ( if ill-advised ) that Anwar himself was forced to play catch-up . <p> Differences have also arisen on issues like naming a shadow cabinet , economic policy and the response to a number of pressing national issues . Now another argument has broken out on the issue of whether the opposition should quickly form a broad coalition with Perikatan Nasional ( PPBM , PAS and Gerakan ) . Anwar is thought to favour the idea while both DAP and Amanah are adamantly against it . Even Rafizi , who finally felt compelled to come out of retirement , has dismissed the idea as morally repugnant given that PPBM played a central role in bringing down the PH administration via the infamous Sheraton Move . <p> Unsurprisingly , Anwar 's call for the opposition to regroup following the debacle in Johor has fallen on deaf ears . Regroup around who and what ? A leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the public ? A coalition that is now heavily encumbered by past baggage , bad memories and poor performance ? An agenda that is so muddled that no one really knows what the coalition stands for anymore ? Surely , regrouping around a failed leader who is unwilling to change and a failed strategy can not be a winning formula . All it will accomplish is give the court cluster an easy ride to Putrajaya . <p> PH must now take ownership of its own poor leadership , its muddled messaging and its unappealing platform and act quickly and decisively . There 's no point complaining about low voter turnout , restrictions on campaigning or pointing fingers at each other . Only a drastic makeover -- new leaders , an electoral pact with Muda and other select independent candidates , a platform that appeals to Malay voters as much as it does to non-Malay voters , one that will energise and inspire all Malaysians -- will suffice . It may even be time for a name change to shed all the negativity associated with PH . <p> Time is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The tide is shifting towards UMNO but there is still time if the opposition can get their act together . Can they put aside their egos and their ambitions and build a winning coalition ? If they ca n't or wo n't , history will blame them as much as the court cluster for Malaysia 's descent into the gutter .

They need to ensure a straight fight in the next election and have an electoral pact like what Muda had with DAP and Amanah , " said Hisommudin . <p> Dr Mazlan Ali from Universiti Teknologi Malaysia agreed , and said there have been several precedents where opposing parties worked together despite years of hostility . <p> " Muhyiddin has no other choice but to accept PH 's olive branch , " Mazlan said . <p> " Dr Mahathir Mohamad and Anwar Ibrahim had 20 years of enmity but they let go of the past and worked together to defeat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things about DAP too and DAP did the same to Dr Mahathir . <p> " Muhyiddin or Bersatu or PN has no other choice but to accept PH as a partner .

It made its debut in the March 12 Johor polls , winning one out of seven state seats it contested . <p> Amira , who is the party 's sole assemblyman in the 56-seat Johor legislative assembly , said Muda 's main aim is to extend voter education and political awareness to the youth and rural voters . <p> Even after all the publicity about Undi18 , the court cases and effort put into getting the voting age lowered from 21 to 18 , she said many young people still do not know they can vote and need to be educated about their rights . <p> " In urban areas , there are no issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas , we find low awareness among youth of their democratic right to vote , " she told The Malaysian Insight . <p> " Many of them did n't know they could vote .

The crisis has left the European Union at the mercy of the weather and Russian President Vladimir Putin 's wiles , both notoriously difficult to predict . <p> " The energy crisis hit the bloc when security of supply was not on the menu of EU policymakers , " says Maximo Miccinilli , head of energy and climate at consultants FleishmanHillard EU . He expects the energy crunch to keep prices volatile and also trigger more political tension between regulators in Brussels and the leaders of the bloc 's 27 member states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's been years in the making . Europe is in the midst of an energy transition , shutting down coal-fired electricity plants and increasing its reliance on renewables . Wind and solar are cleaner but sometimes fickle , as illustrated by the sudden drop in turbine-generated power the continent recorded last year . <p> Moscow 's increased leverage over its neighbours became apparent at the tail end of the last winter , an unusually cold and long one that depleted Europe 's inventories of gas , just as its economies were emerging from the pandemic-induced recession . <p> Over the summer , state-controlled Gazprom PJSC began capping flows to the continent , aggravating shortages caused by deferred maintenance at oil and gas fields in the North Sea and raising the stakes on a costly and long-delayed pipeline project championed by the Kremlin . <p> At the same time , countries from Japan to China were boosting their imports of liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) in preparation for the coming winter . All of this left Europe struggling to replenish its dwindling stockpiles during the warm months , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's leaders betrayed no alarm . On July 14 , the European Commission unveiled the world 's most ambitious package to eliminate fossil fuels in a bid to avert the worst consequences of climate change . With their eyes trained on longer-term goals , such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions at least 55% by 2030 from 1990 levels , the politicians did not sufficiently appreciate some of the potential pitfalls that lay immediately ahead on the road to decarbonisation . <p> Europe 's natural gas production has been in decline for years , which has left it more reliant on imports . Now , Russia stands poised to further cement its position as the bloc 's top supplier . Gazprom and its European partners have plowed US$11 billion into Nord Stream 2 , a 1,230-kilometer ( 764-mile ) pipeline running beneath the Baltic Sea from Russia to Germany . <p> Repeatedly delayed by US sanctions , the decade-long project hit another roadblock this fall , when a new coalition government took power in Germany and the country 's energy regulator put final approval on hold . The move further roiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records day after day since July . Putin , in a televised speech delivered on Dec 24 , touted the benefits of the controversial conduit , saying " the additional volumes of gas on the European market would undoubtedly lower the price on the spot . " <p> A recent bump in LNG imports from the US has provided some relief , but it 's temporary at best . France needs to take several of its reactors offline for maintenance and repairs , resulting in a 30% reduction in nuclear capacity in early January , while Germany is moving ahead with plans to shut down all of its nuclear plants . With the two coldest months of winter still ahead , the fear is that Europe may run out of gas . <p> Storage sites are only 56% full , more than 15 percentage points below the 10-year average .

And that 's assuming normal weather conditions . <p> With energy policy largely in the hands of member states , EU officials lack the authority to compel national governments to replenish gas inventories more quickly . To make matters worse , Russia is building troops on the border with Ukraine , a move US intelligence sources say presages a possible invasion . <p> About a third of Russian gas flowing to Europe crosses Ukraine , and though shipments were n't disrupted during Russia 's 2014 annexation of Crimea , there 's no guarantee that would remain the case if a war were to break out this year . <p> The energy situation limits the scope of actions Western powers can take to counter Russian aggression , says Jason Bordoff , director of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University . " The ability of Europe and the US to respond to a Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe 's energy crisis by sanctioning Russian energy exports and , more broadly , by the threat that Russia could retaliate to any confrontation by restricting gas flows into Europe , as Russia did in 2006 and 2009 , " says Bordoff , a former energy and climate adviser in the Obama administration . <p> Traders are already preparing for the worst , with prices for gas delivered from spring through 2023 surging about 40% over the past month . Some say the crunch could last until 2025 , when the next wave of LNG projects in the US starts supplying the world market . <p> " It 's hard to see how a decent level of gas storage can be achieved without additional Russian exports via Nord Stream 2 or existing routes , " says Massimo Di-Odoardo , vice president for gas and LNG research at Wood Mackenzie .

This is thanks to the improved financials and job confidence recovery . <p> The overall optimistic mood is also reflected in the real estate market performance . <p> According to the Property Market Review 2021/2022 report by Rahim &amp; Co International Sdn Bhd , which was officially launched on Jan 27 , in the first nine months of 2021 , Malaysia recorded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slight drop of 1.8% year on year in volume . However , there was a notable increase of 21.4% y-o-y in value . <p> Rahim &amp; Co director of research Sulaiman Sahed says that after property market transactions fell in 2020 ( -9.9% in volume and -15.8% in value ) from 2019 's pre-Covid environment , the first half of 2021 saw a significant rebound as the economy and market gradually adjusted to a pandemic environment with a 21% jump in volume and 32.1% in value . However , the overall performance was dragged down in 3Q2021 , when the FMCO kicked in . Among others , the residential sector has seen the most significant slowdown in terms of transactions . <p> " Residential property transaction activities showed growth in the first half but slowed down in the third quarter , resulting in an overall growth of 2.6% for the first nine months of the year . On the supply side , new launches in the primary market had dropped , as developers were still adjusting and affected by the pandemic and the country 's containment measures , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the report , adding that sporadic quick sales were observed for owner-occupier and domestic-focused markets . <p> It is also worth noting that several states in Malaysia have recorded encouraging residential property transaction performance , such as Kuala Lumpur ( +10.1% ) , Selangor ( +11.5% ) , Penang ( +18.8% ) and Sabah ( +8.4% ) . Overall , residential property transactions in Malaysia grew 2.6% in the first nine months of 2021 . <p> " The residential market recovery efforts were further supported by the extended HOC ( Home Ownership Campaign ) till the end of 2021 , the exemption of RPGT ( real property gains tax ) and the initiatives provided under Budget 2022 . A more holistic support was also given by the economic stimulus introduced throughout the year that aimed to restore the livelihoods of ? Malaysians and revive the business sectors , " Sulaiman explains . <p> Sulaiman : The overhang units seen across all price segments signify that the root cause is not just property absolute selling prices ( Photo by Shahril Basri/The Edge ) <h> More overhang property <p> As at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serviced apartments and small office/home office SoHo units ) worth RM41.59 billion in Malaysia , the majority of which comprised high-rise dwellings . <p> " The overhang units seen across all price segments signify that the root cause is not just the properties ' absolute selling prices , but also the size , psf price , type , location as well as buyers ' personal preference and considerations when making a purchase decision , " Sulaiman says . <p> According to the report , residential property priced between RM500,001 and RM700,000 is the category with the most unsold units in 3Q2021 , at 14,061 units , or 24.8% . It is worth noting that 83.2% of the properties in this category are high-rise residential properties . <p> Meanwhile , property priced between RM300,001 and RM500,000 came in second , with a total of 12,229 units , or 21.6% . Similar to the above category , the majority ( 87.8% ) of the property in this category are high-rises . <p> Despite the country 's overhang easing slightly quarter on quarter ( q-o-q ) in 3Q2021 , the overall number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not yet constructed ) , which stood at 205,217 units , is the highest since 2016 . <p> " One of the reasons is the buying incentives have not made enough impact , as disposable income levels remain low and economic uncertainty persists . This brings forth a problem of completed units rivalling newer incoming units , and the longer a dwelling remains unsold after completion , the less appeal it holds for buyers , " Sulaiman explains . <p> Citing Rahim &amp; Co 's Capital Cities ? Average House Prices report , he says the current key challenge of overhang property is that income levels in the past year have fluctuated because of the pandemic , which has worsened the ongoing issue of housing affordability . <p> According to the report , it takes an average of 6.9 years for a household to save up enough money to afford a property in Kuala Lumpur . In Penang , it takes 6.4 years ; Johor , 5.8 years ; and Selangor , 5.7 years . <p> Looking ahead , Rahim &amp; Co expects residential property prices to undergo a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The firm also urges the government to consider reviewing and revamping the HOC , which just ended in 2021 , to put more focus on the secondary market . <p> " The secondary residential market accounts for 70% to 80% of total property transactions in the country , and it will continue to dominate the market . The government should introduce something for the secondary market to help purchasers make faster decisions , thus driving the entire property market forward , " Sulaiman says . <h> Commercial segment challenging <p> On the other hand , the commercial property sectors remain mostly under pressure , especially in the tenancy performance and rental levels , a trend that Rahim &amp; Co expects will carry on into 2022 as the incoming supply continues even though demand is still being shaken up by the pandemic . <p> According to the report , transactions for the office and retail segments in the first nine months of 2021 declined 3.2% and 0.9% y-o-y respectively , where Kuala Lumpur was the biggest loser . It saw the number of office transactions decline 5.4% and retail drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation 's supply of purpose-built office space , the Klang Valley has seen its supply surpass 150 million sq ft in total existing office space , with the completion of several new buildings . This has heightened the level of concern about the sustainability of such market capacity when placed alongside a demand pace that has slowly declined over the years , " Sulaiman notes . <p> As at 1H2021 , the office occupancy rate in the Klang Valley was at 72.1% after a further fall from 75.4% in 1H2020 . He pointed out that at this tenancy level , the Klang Valley 's office market has a vacancy of 41.9 million sq ft . <p> " Factors that contribute to the challenging situation faced by office building owners include new workplace practices that focus more on remote working for social- ? distancing purposes and staying relevant to the current trend in demand by new and existing tenants against a highly competitive supply market , " Sulaiman says . <p> He believes the market will take time to reach a new equilibrium , as demand is still struggling to cope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its pace to enter the market . <p> Moreover , the traditional purpose-built office segment is also facing the challenge of the rise of co-working spaces . <p> New co-working spaces have been mushrooming in the past few years . In November 2021 , for instance , Switzerland-based ? International Workplace Group plc announced two new luxury flexible workspace locations in Kuala Lumpur -- Spaces Exchange 106 and Regus Bukit Bintang City Centre ( BBCC ) . <p> Located on the 23rd floor of The Exchange 106 at Tun Razak Exchange , Space Exchange 106 offers 38,309 sq ft of workplace solutions with a 360-degree panoramic view of the city skyline . Meanwhile , Regus Bukit Bintang City Centre is located in The Stride at BBCC and will be officially launched in 1Q2022 . <p> Similar challenging sentiment and conditions were also seen for the retail sector , which had been heavily affected by the pandemic because of the significant loss of foot traffic from strict local MCOs and international border controls . The national occupancy rate declined 2% y-o-y to 76.6% in 1H2021 . Of the existing retail complex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the total of 73.6 million sq ft was vacant . <p> Asked about the retail sector 's outlook , Sulaiman says there may have been several more closures of retail brand outlets in 2021 but new openings and expansions were also observed , signalling a resilient market that is adapting to a new business environment . <p> " While the Covid-19 containment measures in 2021 had been a dampener at certain points of the year , 2022 is projected to have a better growth trajectory as high vaccination rates allow physical visitor traffic movement . As such , seasonal sales periods are viewed as having better prospects . And while e-commerce has established its position as the new way to shop , physical shopping malls and retail outlets have maintained their relevance , as evidenced by the returning footfall during looser movement restrictions . " <p> He also believes that , at present , industrial properties will continue to attract more attention than others . <p> " Viewed as one of the more stable sectors in a pandemic environment , it is especially so owing to the logistics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the overwhelming demand for e-commerce transactions , which will continue to hold the spotlight moving forward .

@@89560233 <p> LETTER As Thomas Paine , an English-born American philosopher and revolutionist said , " Those who want to reap the benefits of this great nation must bear the fatigue of supporting it " . <p> Taking the cue from Thomas Paine , the euphoria in 2018 with the change in government has slowly worn off and the fatigue set in with people through a dismal turnout of voters as seen during the Malacca and Johor state elections respectively . <p> Is this a good sign of progress or regress ? Your judgment is good as mine . But if we continue this notion of no-show during GE15 due to the so-called " politics fatigue " , then we should forget about reaping the benefits of this great nation . <p> I believe that a strong potion to keep a great nation up to a high standard of civilization is to have superior characters that hold the balance of power . However , the very moment such a balance of power gets into the hands of second-rate men and women , then surely a nation will inevitably see a decline . Is Malaysia heading in that direction ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the occasion of his majesty 's recent official birthday , has decreed that any deficit of confidence in the country 's ability must be addressed soon to enable the country to rise again on the world stage . <p> Nations do not succumb to lost wars , but rather through racial decay and the destruction of their internal order by compromising them one after the other , which Malaysia is now facing . Look around and observe : we have already compromised the systems of governance , education , etc . <p> Remember , our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter . Continuously being silent , thereafter , will surely spell disaster . <p> According to the ancient Chinese philosopher Laozi , " A great nation is like a great man : When he makes a mistake , he realises it . Having realised it , he admits it . Having admitted it , he corrects it . He considers those who point out his faults as his most benevolent teachers . He thinks of his enemy as the shadow that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the nation for a strong potion to regain our strength ? Due to space constraints , let me just state a few , but there are many more that we could sight . <p> 1 . Nurturing true governance <p> As Malaysians , we need to take a notion to cast our vote during general and by-elections instead of avoiding them . Now , more than ever , we must be responsible and held accountable for choosing the character that represents us in Parliament . <p> If Parliament becomes ignorant , reckless and corrupt , it is because we as a nation tolerate ignorance , recklessness and corruption . If Parliament is transformed into an intelligent , brave and pure institution , it is because we as a nation demand these high qualities to represent us . <p> If by the next two decades we do not rise as a great nation , it will be because we failed to have those who represent us in the institution with the character to nurture true governance . If we condone , then we are condemned . <p> We need a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to inspire and build the dreams of the nation . <p> 2 ) Elect representatives with character , competence <p> I have had enough of hearing the need for an " Anti-Hopping Law " . The last thing I wish to have is a representative transforming from a lawmaker to a troublemaker for the constituents by changing allegiance instead of serving the people . <p> If any of these representatives are devoid of any credibility or a moral compass , then we as a nation must adopt the notion to have recall elections to disallow such representatives from continuing to represent us . <p> A strong potion will be for the Election Commission ( EC ) to accept a petition from the constituents stating reasons why the said elected representative should be replaced by a recall election . How and what criteria are required for setting the petition will be left for the EC 's deliberation . <p> Remember that as a nation , we have to choose our representative with character and calibre in our August House . I repeat , in our August House . <p> 3 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former president of India , the late and revered APJ Abdul Kalam aptly puts it , " If a country is to be corruption free and become a nation of beautiful minds , I strongly feel there are three key societal members who can make a difference . They are the father , mother and teacher . " <p> In my upbringing , I was told the sequence is mother , father , guru and God in raising ornamental citizens for great nations . <p> In revitalising the role of parents and teachers , the family institution will be strengthened and the school , as a place to build character and academic excellence for nation-building , will help to fortify future leaders with great foresight and upholding governance . <p> 4 ) Quality through unity <p> Our coat of arms states " Bersekutu Bertambah Mutu " , where all states , including the federal territories , are directed to stay united . Although used in all dealings of the government , sadly its meaning , characteristics and values are not reflected and emulated . We still see states exerting their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control . <p> A classic example is the issue of floods . I ca n't understand why we are unable to work as a nation , right from the federal level to each state government having a concerted effort to tackle and resolve the flood issues . <p> If addressing the inflow and outflow of rivers , drainage and etc of each state is the national solution to arrest flooding , then cohesively erase the line of control for the betterment of this nation . <p> We should not compete among the states but complement one another so that " Bersekutu Bertambah Mutu " becomes a reality . Our competing spirit should be channelled towards outside Malaysia in placing our country in the global arena . <p> 5 ) Uniting all races , ethnicities <p> Let 's wake up and stand united as postulated in our Rukun Negara . At this crucial juncture , we do n't need divisive policies but policies that are inclusive in building upon the strength of our ethnicities to strive and thrive . <p> A strong potion will be to adopt national values that add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the aspirations of the Rukun Negara , we will start to embrace one another in charting our growth towards nation-building . A classic example is Indonesia with its creed to succeed in emulating their Pancasila . <p> I leave you with a quote borrowed from Abraham Lincoln : " Let the people on both sides keep their self-possession , and just as other clouds have cleared away in due time , so will this , and this great nation shall continue to prosper as before . " <p> Hence , I hope at such times of difficulty , we as a nation , display the whole energy of our character strengths and regain admiration to posterity by reflecting our real strength in becoming a USA nation - United Strength of Asia . <p> I like to share the philosophy of " Ubuntu " as lived by the Zulus . Ubuntu literally means rising in humanity , where " I am because we are " , or " I am because you are " , with a firm belief in a universal bond of sharing that connects all of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the form of the word " muhibbah " , but it has been grossly eroded over the last four to five decades . We need to recalibrate our emotions and subscribe to the notion that " I am who I am because of my nation and country " . <p> Let 's stop whining and start to live as a winning nation , where we stop complaining and start complementing one another . Remember , we fight a global race by ace on our diverse strengths . <p> If in the olden days , our parents could have made instant noodles shared by a large family , school shoes and clothing passed on from one child to the other , why ca n't we pass the baton of a strong nation to the next generation ? <p> Although life was tough then , living and growing were enthralling . Ask anyone from that generation , they would vouch for the same . However , can we say the same now in Malaysia ? Are we really living well , having better wellbeing , lifestyle , etc ? <p> My late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meagre salary , could provide shelter , food and clothing for us in a family of six . However , today , even with a small family , we can not meet the ever-rising costs of living . <p> After 65 years of independence , survival should not be a question . Thriving and striving should be natural . Our neighbouring countries are growing leaps and bounds , but we are still saddled with heaps of issues and finding it difficult to rebound . <p> The US took 300 years of development to get to where it is today , with many of us calling it a superpower . Singapore took 50 years to be where it is today , even without many resources . Japan and Germany were devastated after World War II but they thrived by having a value-creation mindset . <p> However , we , with a set mind before creating value , such as creating employment opportunities , economic growth , environment , etc , from our rich and vast resources bestowed by the Almighty , decided to scrape the bottom and concentrated our efforts on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great nation will not want someone to give them a fish a day , but instead to teach them how to catch fish to sustain their daily living . <p> We need to reset these notions so that we could have a concoction to produce a potion that is potent enough in building this nation . What we lost all these years could be regained to allow us to make gains in the long run . <p> The views expressed here are those of the author/contributor and do not necessarily represent the views of Malaysiakini.

I took like a duck to water when I could first understand what was playing on the radio at a very young age , by about 6 or 7 years old in the mid-1950s . <p> A big Telefunken set had commandeered a prime space in Grandpa 's huge living room -- it would be the go-to private space whenever there was a Radio Sarawak programme of music on . <p> However , it was n't until the mid-1960s that portable transistor radios became easily available at affordable prices that we could have one to share among siblings and being the eldest , I 'd always have it at my bedside at night , at least until curfew time ! <p> The music over the airwaves became my nightly lullabies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1961 that the record request programmes over Radio Sarawak became the in-thing for teens and young adults to send in their weekly requests for the Saturday afternoon two-hour long radio shows ; and they had made teen idols out of then broadcasters ( later known as DJs and TV personalities ) like Anne Tan , Sylvia Lim , Tan Seng Lim , Anthony Ramanair , Roch Kueh and so many others ! <p> I fondly remember how we all used to sigh out aloud whenever Anne Tan would play her obligatory Nat King Cole songs in every single programme that she was hosting ! Johnny Mathis was another one of her favourites . I wish to dedicate this week 's column to the sole surviving host of those wonderful radio programmes of the 1950s-1960s -- my dear friend , Anthony Ramanair ! Thank you for the memories , mate ! <p> I was also greatly influenced by my mother 's love for music and her taste -- from musical shows to popular operas and to vocalists like Nat King Cole , Mario Lanza and Anneke Gronloh . From her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and soundtracks from ' South Pacific ' to ' Camelot ' , from ' The King and I ' and ' My Fair Lady ' . The operatic arias of Lanza , the smooth velvety voice of Cole , and the sparkling vibrancy of Gronloh would fill the house on Saturday mornings and Sunday afternoons during our childhood days . <p> Later on when we all started to cultivate our own tastes in music ( not surprisingly , all my siblings and myself share almost about the same love for some genres and even artistes ) , we would try and steal precious listening time for our own music in the family room , although by our late teens , we had our own private spaces and our own playback devices . <p> It 's not uncommon these days to hear contemporaries complain about the current state of the music scene .

It was only in June 1948 that the more popular 33rpm 12-inch long playing records made out of vinyl were invented and they were to change the way we listened to music for the next half a century . <p> Next came the Philips compact cassette in September 1963 , initially available only for 60 minutes recording but eventually doubling up to 120 .

This type of action diminishes a board . <p> The urgency to act decisively in Surina 's case is even more important as the rising speculation is hurting MDEC 's reputation and staff morale . <p> Already industry players allege that MDEC is moving too slowly , especially since the new and some still-being-formed policies around procurement and grants is creating a logjam at the board level . <p> A case in point for this is on the issue of giving grants as a KPMG report commissioned by MDEC earlier this year revealed many structural and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific recommendations to enhance transparency and decision making at MDEC . <p> This is more so when MDEC has only recently appointed an ex-Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commision ( MACC ) graft buster , Mohamad Zakkuan Talib , as its its certified integrity officer . <p> This , according to Rais , will help MDEC " operate at a high level of governance and integrity and ensure MDEC will be able to carry out its digital mandate without favour of colour , creed or influence . " <p> But while Rais has been touting the fact that the end result of all the changes in governance , procedures and policies will see MDEC become a more efficient , agile and productive agency , a senior executive at another agency that went through its own exercise to improve corporate governance , had already predicted to me that MDEC , in the short term , will suffer through slower decision making -- an unintended consequence of tightened governance . <p> One glaring consequence of the slower turnaround cycle at MDEC is the fact that the agency has been very slow to spend the budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ostensibly made MoF upset as it means that programmes are not hitting the ground . One former senior executive has laid the cause of this on the board . <p> In another instance , a respected leader in the creative content space noted that the disbursement of some emergency grants that were announced last year to help the industry have not happened as the final approval lies with the MDEC board . <p> It has been nine months and counting the executive notes , addding that , " The previous leadership team may not have been perfect , but they knew how to get things done to help MSC Malaysia companies . " <p> And herein lies the rub . When talking about MDEC leadership , many ecosystem players said they believe that Rais has over-stepped his authority and unwittingly undermined Surina 's leadership . <p> Harsher critics alleged that he has taken advantage of the situation and is enjoying playing the role of de facto CEO . <p> But I believe the former , rather than the latter , is the case . <p> Notwithstanding this , Rais and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's position and be totally transparent about it . <p> This is because MDEC is still seen by many in the ecosystem to be the most important digital economy pushing agency , or as former CEO Yasmin Mahmood liked to describe its role -- " the tip of the spear .

@@90860233 <p> I 'm going to start this off with an admission , a confession even -- I do n't use a smartwatch or a fitness tracker , and I prefer using regular wired earbuds over wireless ones . Which is perhaps why that makes me the perfect person to try out two of Oppo 's new accessories , the Oppo Watch Free and Oppo Enco Air 2 . <p> I have been using them on the regular for a couple of weeks now and so far at least , one of them has been an absolute win while the other is ... not exactly a stellar gadget if you ask me . But before I spoil too much about how they 've been , let 's begin with the Oppo Watch Free . <h> The Oppo Watch Free looks and feels like a toy <p> Now I am not a huge smartwatch person , as the last time I truly used a smartwatch on a daily basis was the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic that we also got to review . The Oppo Watch Free though is very much not in the same league as the aforementioned Samsung , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather more of a fitness tracker . <p> Pulling it out of the box though , the first impressions I had of it are not great to say the least . It is extremely light at just 32.6g and the vanilla-coloured strap especially felt very cheap . Oppo is framing the lightness in a good way of course , saying that the Watch Free offers ' an almost weightless comfort ' . The 19mm wide strap is made of silicone but has a textured finish to it to mimic leather , while the buckle is plastic . Already , this did n't feel great in the hand and when I put it on , I found that the silicone strap is actually kind of elastic , meaning that it actually stretches a fair bit to the point where I was afraid of it snapping -- this is not something you should be looking for in a watch strap by the way . You can swap out the straps though if you 'd like , with quick release pins on the back of the straps . <p> Moving on to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.64-inch AMOLED screen here has a 280 x 456p resolution and is actually pretty decent . It 's somewhat decently sized for a fitness tracker and is pretty bright too . You can choose between a number of preset watch faces here , all showing off the AMOLED display 's vivid colours . You can even download more watch faces or even have it create a new watch face by taking a picture with your smartphone which I found pretty cool . However , there 's a fairly noticeable ' chin ' with the bezels on the display , almost reminiscent of Android smartphones from 2018 . There 's no physical buttons here either , which means that to get it to boot up you actually need to connect it to the bundled magnetic charging cable to power it up . The swipe gestures needed to navigate around the Watch Free are also a little cumbersome , as it does n't work exactly as I intended every now and then . <h> It works just fine ... most of the time <p> Once I had it on my wrist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of how light it is . That may be something you 'd want in your watch of course , but not me . Nevertheless , the Oppo Watch Free is n't something you 'd get anyway if you wanted to feel a watch on your wrist . You get the Oppo Watch Free because of its functionalities and features duh , which in this case is actually quite a lot . Running through what it offers , once you 've linked it to your smartphone with the HeyTap Health companion app you can have it control your music , light up the display as a flashlight , alert you when you get a notification or a call , and act as an alarm too . Nothing too fancy of course , but these are all features you 'd expect to have really on a fitness tracker and it 's good to see that it covers most of the essential ones here . <p> As for its exercise modes , it claims to have over 100 exercise modes to pick from covering stuff like running , yoga , rowing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm quite obviously not the more fitness-minded of people , but I did have it on when using a stationary bike and the Oppo Watch Free did track my workout just fine and I could see how intense I had been working out . It also managed to track my heart rate throughout the sessions , and even beeped once my heart rate reached too high , telling me to keep an eye on it . I should point out though that I did n't have a medical device to track my heart rate and compare it to . Another cool feature I appreciated was the stress test , which somehow could determine how stressed out I was . <p> The Oppo Watch Free also has quite a lot of sleep tracking options here . You can have it tell you when you should be sleeping , and while you 're sleeping it can monitor your sleep cycles , sleep quality , total hours slept and even snore monitoring . When you wake up , you 'll then get a sleep report which lets you in on those details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there were a couple of occasions where it seemed to have glitched out . For instance , one time after waking up , I took off the Watch Free as I went to the bathroom . By the time I was done bathing and got ready to head out , I grabbed my Oppo Watch Free only to find that it thought I was still asleep when I was actually up already getting a shower . And on other times , it straight up just did n't record any sleep time , or recorded just part of it rather than the entire sleep I had . Maybe it 's just user error , but I did find these a little annoying . <p> Battery though is a bit more touch and go with the Oppo Watch Free . Oppo advertises up to 14 days of battery life on a single charge with the Watch Free which I never , ever got . In reality , it was anywhere between four to six days before I needed to power it up again . That was with full connectivity to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high brightness . I was also using it to control my music a fair bit so there 's that . You 'll perhaps be able to get more out of it if you tweaked the settings to the point where it 's barely being used , but at that point you may as well get a regular watch . Charging times are somewhat alright , taking a little under three hours to get it back to 100% . <h> You still should n't pay this much for it <p> Ultimately though , it 's hard to recommend the Oppo Watch Free considering it retails for RM449 . That 's just way too much in my mind for what is essentially a glorified fitness tracker . There 's just so many other fitness trackers to be had that offer much better value for money . For example , there 's the Honor Band 6 that retails for RM189 which has a 1.47-inch AMOLED display , an up to 14 day battery life , heart rate and blood oxygen level monitoring , sleep tracking and notification alerts , though you are limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Band line is another fitness tracker that offers excellent bang for your buck , with the latest Mi Smart Band 6 going for as low as RM133 on Shopee at time of writing . It has a 1.56-inch AMOLED display and with up to 30 fitness modes too . <p> If you do want to get a more fully fledged smartwatch though , you will need to increase your budget a smidge for better WearOS options . The Mobvoi Ticwatch E3 is perhaps one of the better entry-level WearOS smartwatches on the market right now , and is available for as low as RM699 on Shopee . It has a 1.3-inch LCD display but crucially comes with WearOS installed , though it is only slated to get a software update to WearOS 3.0 later this year . Nevertheless , as we mentioned in our review of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic , having WearOS onboard makes your smartwatch experience just so much better . If you want a fitness tracker , get a fitness tracker for the right price and if you want a real smartwatch , you should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was done with the Oppo Watch Free , I decided to stop using it on a daily basis , swapping back to my trusty ol ' Timex instead . However , as you may recall Oppo did send us two items for review . So how does the Oppo Enco Air 2 wireless earbuds fare ? <h> Oppo Enco Air 2 : Deja vu ? <p> The Oppo Enco Air 2 is the sequel to the original Oppo Enco Air true wireless earphones , though you 'd be hard-pressed trying to tell the difference as the Enco Air 2 has a similar pill-shaped charging case , Apple Airpods-inspired earbuds and ... is that a translucent charging case top cover ? Honestly , the first time I saw the Enco Air 2 I was just sort of amused by the charging case . The translucent ' jelly case ' lid is being advertised by Oppo to had a ' soft in-hand feel ' and -- get this -- lets you see inside the case to make sure you know they are there . It 's a peculiar look for sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Oppo Enco Air 2 on the left , Apple Airpods on the rightOppo Enco Air 2 on the left , Apple Airpods on the right <p> Taking a quick look at the hardware specs , there 's nothing much in particular that stands out really . There 's no active noise cancelling , and the Airpods-style hard tip design to the earbuds means that you 're not really getting a lot of passive noise isolation either . Each earbud has a 13.4mm ' composite titanized diaphram ' dynamic driver with a 20Hz to 20kHz frequency response range and uses Bluetooth 5.2 connectivity with either the AAC or SBC audio codec . It charges with USB-C though there 's no charging cable provided with the box . They weigh just 3.5g per earbud and together with the case weigh just shy of 40g . Oppo also claims that they have IPX4 water resistance which again , it 's not much but it 's better than nothing . <h> But how does it actual sound like ? <p> So once I got it powered up , I decided to pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I came across the first hurdle : the HeyMelody companion app on iOS does not support the Oppo Enco Air 2 . Curiously , it supports the original Enco Air and the Enco Air 2 Pro but not the Enco Air 2 earbuds . Okay , fine no big deal . I downloaded the HeyMelody app on the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra instead and yes , it works just fine on Android . You 'll still be able to pair it to iOS devices , but you wo n't be able to link it via the app . As for the fit and finish , each earbud fit fine in my ears and the stems are n't overtly long or anything like that either . In fact , you could probably have them in your ear and have people think you 're actually just using Apple Airpods too . <p> When it comes to using it to listen to music , the earbuds are ... mostly fine . They have a somewhat narrow sound stage by default and do n't offer much when it comes to the details and ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though once you head over to the HeyMelody app and change the Enco Live sound effect from ' Original Sound ' to ' Bass Boost ' . You immediately get a wider sound stage with a much more rich and fuller sound . Listening to The Adventures of Rain Dance Maggie by Red Hot Chili Peppers , I get the full range of Flea 's bass while not totally overpowering the rest of the song . If you 're a basshead you 'll certainly prefer having it in this mode compared to the original settings and I think with it on , it sounds very good . <p> There 's a third ' Clear Vocals ' setting here too , though it arguably sounds the worst among the three , providing a very flat sound that seems to try and get the vocals clearer , but in reality makes the audio sound quite muted . And in songs that feature no vocals like Crab Rave , you 're basically listening to a more muted version of the Original Sound mode . <p> There 's a Game Mode option too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latency . I do notice a little bit of latency even in YouTube videos when Game Mode is turned off , and having it on makes it much more bearable , almost unnoticeable even . As for when I 'm actually gaming , it certainly works as advertised . That little bit of desync when Game Mode is off can get quite annoying , especially in games where audio is important such as Apex Legends Mobile . I also did n't really notice any discernable dip in audio quality when Game Mode is on compared to off , so I basically have it on the whole time . Microphone quality meanwhile is just okay , as it 's certainly usable for calls and such but you wo n't want to use it for streaming or anything like that . <p> What I did n't like though was the touch controls on the Oppo Enco Air 2 . You touch and hold on the left to reduce the volume , and doing so on the right increases the volume . Double tapping it by default meanwhile lets you skip to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lets me further customise these controls , allowing me to choose double tapping the left or right earbud for instance as play/pause and the other into select previous song . It also lets me choose what triple tapping does , which can be either bringing up the voice assistant or toggling Game Mode . However , for the most part I found that the touch controls are way too sensitive , meaning that even when I 'm lying on my side in bed , it will accidentally trigger and suddenly just lower or increase my volume . The double tap controls meanwhile are pretty clunky and do n't always work as intended . <p> Battery life meanwhile is fine but not particularly great . Oppo advertises 4 hours of listening time when using the earbuds , with another 24 hours of charge from the charging case . I was able to get somewhat close to those numbers , with over three hours of use with the earbuds alone and with the charging case getting me another four and a bit charges for the earbuds for around a total of 18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the time and with Bass Boost and Game Mode on though ; with those settings off you may be able to stretch it a bit more . <h> They 're a solid pair of earbuds at a reasonable price <p> Overall , I 'm a fan of the Oppo Enco Air 2 . They retail at RM249 so they 're certainly not the cheapest true wireless earbuds out there , but the sound quality you 're getting from these hard tip earbuds are actually quite decent . I mean sure , they ca n't compete with the more premium TWS earbuds out there like the Jabra Elite 7 Pro for instance , but the Oppo Enco Air 2 is certainly one of the better hard tip earbuds at this price point . <p> If you need one that 's much better there 's of course the Apple Airpods , with the 3rd generation ones priced at RM829 -- these also obviously work seamlessly with iOS devices , something the Oppo Enco Air 2 failed out right out of the gate . But for just over a third of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punching above its weight class for sure . Alternatively , if you seek one with ANC at this price point , there 's also the Honor Earbuds 2 Lite that launched at RM299 . <p> And as for Oppo 's accessories in general , well , you win some you lose some right ? The Oppo Watch Free simply does n't bring anything new to the table and when you 're priced that high for a fitness tracker , it 's hard to recommend over fan favourites in value town like the Mi Smart Band 6 . The Oppo Enco Air 2 though is much better , as despite some negatives like subpar touch controls , the audio quality to me at least is pretty decent . In fact , I still carry a pair of these around , despite not having regularly used wireless earbuds prior to this . Has it fully converted me yet ? Probably not as I also carry a pair of wired earbuds with me , but it was certainly good enough to convince me to bring it along with me now .

Along with it are numerous hardware upgrades such as the inclusion of Qualcomm 's latest high-end processor , better battery life , and so on . But surely , that ca n't be all , right ? <p> If there 's one thing that I 've always looked forward to from the Find X series over its competitors , it 's the new innovation that OPPO is known to introduce on its flagship smartphone line . For instance ; the first model featured a motorised pop-up camera module , while its successor highlights the company 's impressive optical and hybrid telephoto camera abilities , and last year 's Find X3 Pro came with a cool but gimmicky microscope camera . <p> Which now brings us to the fourth generation flagship ( which is named the X5 because of reasons we 're all familiar with ) . But instead of introducing something out of the ordinary , the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its first-party MariSilicon X imaging neural processing unit ( NPU ) . So yes , it appears that OPPO is playing it safe yet again with this year 's release -- much like the Find X2 series from two years prior . <p> Nevertheless , the lack of something unique on this year 's model should n't necessarily considered as a determining factor . As mentioned earlier , the OPPO Find X5 Pro still features a significant array of hardware improvements that makes it a solid contender in the flagship smartphone segment . <h> Design <p> If you fancied last year 's Find X 's design , then you 'll be glad to know that the newer Find X5 Pro inherits this design language . Unchanged is the seamlessly integrated rear camera to its rear case , but now with a trapezium-like shape . The bump itself only protrudes slightly from the phone 's body , granting the phone a very slim side profile . <p> Like its predecessor , the sleek sports car-esque design highly complements the phone 's curved display . As you can see from the images @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Find X5 Pro that was passed to us is the Ceramic White option which , without a doubt , grants the phone a very premium look and feel . Alternatively , OPPO is also offering its current generation flagship in Glaze Black , which is pretty much the same but , obviously , in a different colour . <p> While I really like its design , I personally find that the Find X5 Pro can be a bit slippery when casually held with one hand . This is an expensive device after all and even with Corning Gorilla Glass Victus protection , you would n't want it to slip from your hands and witness the effects of Newton 's laws . Therefore , if you are planning to own the phone , I highly recommend that you also use it along with the silicone case included in the box . <p> That aside , the phone is actually pretty comfortable to hold and use . In regards to the latter , its physical button layouts are pretty standard and familiar , where the volume rockers are situated on the left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just in case you 're wondering , the OPPO Find X5 has a dust/water resistance rating of IP68 . <p> You could also bump the resolution up higher to WQHD+ ( 3216 x 1440 ) via settings if you wish , though doing so will consume more power . Naturally , lowering down the Find X5 Pro 's refresh rate would also grant for longer battery life . Personally , I 'd stick with the default settings , as I find it to be sufficient for handling my everyday media consumption . <p> As for the phone 's interface , OPPO 's Android 12-powered ColorOS UI definitely does its job well of helping you navigate around , while also providing you with flashy animations when you charge the phone or unlocking it via fingerprint . Speaking of which , I 'm pleased to find that the under-display fingerprint sensor on the Find X5 Pro is very fast -- granting me quick access to the device . Of course , there are other biometric approaches as well , such as Face Unlock , if you fancy alternative or additional safety measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chipset and memory configuration are superb -- as expected from a flagship-tier smartphone . Needless to say , the Find X5 pro is more than capable of flawlessly handling tasks such as multi-app switching , heavy photo and video editing , as well as high resolution video recordings . <h> ADVERTISEMENT <p> For gaming , the phone holds up very well running graphics intensive and demanding titles , resulting in decently fast loading times and high frame rates . Genshin Impact , my usual go-to for benchmarking smartphone hardware , runs well on the Find X5 Pro at the highest setting and with the fps set to 60 . I should also point out there are times that I notice a dip in frames when there 's plenty of effects and characters happening on-screen . However , this may be caused by the game 's own optimisation issues rather than the phone 's hardware . <p> The Find X5 Pro high performance also leads to a common issue : high heat generation . This is very apparent when I was running various benchmark software as well as Genshin Impact . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feel uncomfortable when gaming for long periods of time . <p> Last but not least is the phone 's battery . For this , I can safely say that its usage life is one of the best out there . Using our usual video streaming test approach , the Find X5 Pro went on for almost 12 hours straight with 20% of battery to spare . Keep in mind that our test requires the phone to play continuous streaming videos at full resolution and screen brightness , but at a low volume . <p> With this , you can be certain that the Find X5 Pro could go on even longer when used typically . And as advertised , charging the phone with its included 80W charger will have it back up from flat to 100% in less than an hour . <h> Camera <p> The imaging setup on the OPPO Find X5 Pro is definitely no slouch , packing dual Sony IMX766 50MP sensors on its primary and ultra-wide cameras , as well as a 13MP Samsung telephoto lens . Both of which are more than capable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lowlight environments . This is further complemented by the MariSilicon X 's AI capabilities which automatically enhances an image 's vibrancy , exposure and so on to produce very professional-esque results almost instantly . <p> However , expect to still see the usual flaws such as artefacts , muddiness , and noise and to present themselves when shooting in lowlight , especially in near pitch black darkness . Despite this , the amount of details and colours preserved when snapping photos in the dark are actually downright impressive . So much so that the photos produced look as though they were shot under adequate lighting . <p> Shot without Night Mode.Shot with Night Mode . <p> Though Find X5 Pro 's camera system mostly sounds good so far , I do have my gripes . Firstly , its excellent OIS feature is not present on its telephoto shooter , which instead relies on digital stabilisation . This still provides a bit of a challenge for those who wish to capture photos of distant objects , as you always have to make sure that the subject stays in frame . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited , as it only allows for 2x optical zoom while the rest are done digitally . <p> Seeing that this model ditches its predecessor 's microscope camera , I was really hoping that OPPO would compensate for this by bringing back the Find X2 Pro 's 5x optical OIS telephoto . But alas , instead we have the MariSilicon X as one of the new flagship 's main highlights . Sure , the enhanced picture quality produced by the NPU and its AI system are remarkable , but I personally feel that the Find X5 Pro is lacking a real standout feature to make it stand out from its competitors . <p> Shot with XPAN mode . <p> So where 's the Hasselblad-made goodies on the Find X5 Pro ? Well , most of the company 's involvement is mainly present in the phone 's camera software , which automatically tunes the colours of images and videos based on Hasselblad 's standards . OPPO also made its camera app 's shutter button to appear in orange , which is also a nice nod to the Swedish camera manufacturer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that allows you take photos in a wider aspect ratio , complete with a film-like grainy filter and appearance . This is more of a novelty feature than anything and despite being a panorama mode , it utilises the phone 's primary lens rather than the ultra-wide . <h> Sample Images <h> Competition <p> Since OPPO 's current-gen flagship comes with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 , it 's only natural that we point out similarly equipped devices for comparison . For this review , we 've listed two of its closest rivals from Samsung and Xiaomi , which are already available in Malaysia . <h> Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra <p> Samsung is definitely the brand to beat for every other Android-based smartphone maker in the market . This year , the South Korean tech giant presents the Galaxy S22 Ultra as its top-of-the-line flagship , which features a curved 6.8-inch display with 3088 x 1440 pixel resolution and 120Hz refresh rate , Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset , up to 12GB of RAM and 512GB internal storage , as well as 5,000mAh battery with 45W fast charging . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 108MP primary camera , 10MP periscope telephoto , 10MP standard telephoto , 12MP ultra-wide , and a 40MP selfie camera on the phone 's display . The Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra starts at RM 5,099 and maxes out at RM 5,899 for the highest available spec . <h> Xiaomi 12 Pro <p> The Xiaomi 12 Pro is one of the first smartphones to feature the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset in the market , so it 's obvious that we 've decided to add it to this list . Besides that , it also comes with 12GB RAM , 256GB internal storage , and a 4,600mAh battery with 120W fast charging support . <p> Imaging-wise , Xiaomi 's current-gen flagship comes with triple 50MP sensors for its primary , ultra-wide and telephoto cameras , while featured in front is a 32MP selfie camera . As for pricing , the Xiaomi 12 Pro arrives in a single configuration which is sold locally at RM 3,899 . <h> Conclusion <p> Priced at RM 4,999 , the OPPO Find X5 Pro is going to be a tough one to recommend seeing that some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Featuring a unique selling point would often justify smartphones with high prices , but as I pointed out earlier , OPPO 's current-gen flagship is clearly missing something truly unique that could set it apart from the rest . <p> Nevertheless , the OPPO Find X5 Pro is still a solid allrounder that does not disappoint in terms of performance and imaging . For those looking for a flagship-tier upgrade , this device is definitely one of the worthwhile choices for you to consider . Especially if you 're in the market for a premium smartphone that certainly looks the part .

@@91353237 <p> The Renault Captur gets a thorough makeover , now based on the new generation CMF-B modular platform that will go on to serve elsewhere in the **25;1680;TOOLONG alliance . The new Captur gets 85% new parts compared to its predecessor that was made on the previous-generation platform , says Renault . <p> Advantages gained from the new CMF-B platform include a lighter architecture particularly around the bodywork , axles and the hood , while an underbody fairing improves aerodynamic performance . Renault also claims ' greater acoustic comfort ' for the new B-segment SUV , credited to the insulation of the engine compartment which sees improvements between 1.5 -- 2 dB at speeds up to 130 km/h . <p> The Captur continues in being visually distinctive with its available contrasting roof colour ; key colour choices include Atacama Orange , Flame Red and Iron Blue , plus Amethyst Black on the Initiale Paris version , and are part of a palette comprising 11 bodywork colours , four contrasting roof colours and three external customisation packs for a total of 90 possible combinations , says Renault . <p> Lighting now comprises full LED headlamps across all trim levels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M ? gane , Koleos and Clio in blending into the family look . This visual signature is reflected in the Captur 's tail lights as well , where the C-shape is adopted and accentuates the car 's width . <p> The new Captur adds 11 cm to its overall length which aids in providing more space -- 81 litres of boot space is gained over the previous model for a total of 536 litres , while the cabin can accommodate up to 27 litres of interior storage . The split-folding rear seats feature a sliding bench that can be moved 16 cm fore and aft , and can take a maximum payload length of 1.57 m . The boot floor can also separate cargo between two levels . <p> Inside , the Captur 's cabin builds upon the design used within the fifth-generation Clio , where the ' Smart Cockpit ' retains its slight angle towards the driver , with its ' flying console ' which floats above the central tunnel . The portrait orientation of the infotainment screen mimics that within the Clio , here a 9.3-inch touchscreen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largest in its segment . <p> The Captur also follows the Clio in using a digital screen for its driver instrumentation , with a colour screen up to 10.2 inches available , and include GPS navigation information in its display . The aforementioned flying console liberates space for additional storage as well as for a smartphone induction charging system , while the ' e-shifter ' gear lever wears a boot that can be customised to match the rest of the interior . <p> Audio in the Captur is a Bose system which now comprises nine speakers over the previous count of seven , with two more tweeters in the rear doors being the new additions . Also added is the Fresh Air Speaker ( FAS ) , in essence a compact subwoofer that reproduces bass frequencies without a conventional ported enclosure , instead sending bass into the cabin via a patented duct system built into the car 's structure . This is built into the trim on the right-hand-side of the boot and does not take up storage space , says Renault . <p> The driver gets a redesigned steering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowing for a sportier , smaller wheel centre compared to its predecessor . This allows the driver a better view of the instrumentation ahead , while a more comprehensive set of backlit on-wheel controls add to the quality feel , says Renault , and all EDC dual-clutch versions of the Captur get shift paddles . <p> Accommodation within the new Captur features seats with a new seat base that is 15 mm longer and shaped to be more supportive , while the rears of the seat backs have a hollowed lining to give 17 mm additional knee room for the rear passengers . Meanwhile , a new , narrower headrest design in a ' comma-shape ' offers improved rearward visibility , while electric adjustment controls or revised manual controls improve usability . <p> Several upholstery packs are available for the new Captur 's interior ; these include the Saffron Orange Signature Pack with black cloth seats and orange motifs , the Architect Grey Signature Pack with black cloth seats and light grey motifs and the Initial Paris Signature Pack in Saddler Grey . Titanium black leather seats with light grey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drive suite of driver aids are set up from the Captur 's Easy Link touchscreen , with assistance systems for highway driving , parking and evasive measures .

This uses a front camera and radar on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only adaptive cruise control is switched on if road markings are not visible , and if there is no vehicle ahead of the Captur , lane centering assist works from 60 km/h upwards . <p> Further active safety equipment includes active emergency braking , blind spot warning , traffic signal recognition with speed limit alert , as well as lane departure warning . For parking manoeuvres , a 360-degree camera offers a virtual bird 's eye view of the car , and is complemented by a reversing camera , rear cross traffic alert system , front and rear parking sensors , and Easy Park Assist which steers the Captur into an available parallel , angled or perpendicular space , and the driver needs only control the pedals and gearbox . <p> Leading the powertrain charge for the new Captur is the E-Tech plug-in hybrid engine , which pairs a 1.6 litre petrol engine mated to a multimode , dog-clutch direct transmission gearbox , with a pair of electric motors drawing from a 9.8 kWh battery pack . This is rated for 45 km range at up to 135 km/h in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use ( WLTP City cycle ) . <p> The conventional internal combustion engine range comprises two diesels and three petrols . The diesel range features a 1.5 litre Blue dCi in 95 and 115 states of tune , namely with 95 hp and 240 Nm of torque , or 115 hp and 260 Nm of torque . Both get a six-speed manual as standard , while the diesel 115 variant additionally gets the seven-speed EDC . <p> On the petrol front , the entry level is the TCe 100 1.0 litre , three-cylinder engine with 100 hp and 160 Nm of torque paired to a five-speed manual , gaining 10 hp and 20 Nm of torque over the TCe 90 it replaces , says Renault .

Last month , the Malaysian Automotive Association ( MAA ) said it had appealed to the finance ministry to extend the SST exemption , but said it had not received any feedback on the matter . <p> Now , transport minister Datuk Seri Wee Ka Siong has offered his views on the matter , as The Star reports . In a Q&amp;A session following the launch of the ACO Tech ATLAS automotive ecosystem yesterday , he said that he viewed the exemption as a benefit for the automotive industry . <p> However , he understood that the finance ministry would have its own financial considerations to make , and as such , he explained that the decision on whether to continue with the scheme would be up to the finance ministry . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( CKD ) cars and 50% for fully-imported ( CBU ) cars had helped the industry deal with the Covid-19 pandemic .

Interesting idiots like you have no clue how a government is run pretty much the reason why PH only lasted 22 months . <p> If can not discuss objectively , then start degrading yourself by calling names . The purview of a minister goes beyond attending a function and only covering specific topics . It is a relevant topic . It may be an overlapping role . Transportations covers many different aspects of it and as a Minister it part of his role . If the minister can make news being a messenger for a single person recently . ( it made it to our newspapers and he mentioned he was passing the message ) , he can also do that by talking to the MOF . We need to have higher expectations to our ministers and of course to common folk as well . I guess not everyone is as smart as you to run the show .

So what can you expect him to say other than bringing the issue up to the correct person , MOF ? Come on be realistic .

But to answer you , he was asked during an Q&amp;A session at AtlasOS launch so it was somehow out of the topic to his visit which why he gave his personal point of view . He was right to say that the matter and decision is better left to MOF and he affirmed that it is not a Transport Ministry function . <p> As for your forward looking , strategic and tactical execution ? That is MOF purview not MOT . <p> get angry because they can not laugh at others for not able to get the sst exemption .. and then can showoff he got exempted to pour salt on ppl 's wound ? this kinda mentality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house catch fire only . <p> Dong Gor The asiongkor just wayang .. he knows who has final say in GST or SST.Being paid 50 grand monthly , must say something to ' sooth the nerves ' of car buyers , right ?

There have been reports of late that Singapore is seeking to source chickens from other countries other than Malaysia , for example Brazil . <p> An export ban ( may ) help to control prices and may seemingly increase the availability of food , in this case chickens , but Malaysian producers would be denied a wider market and a higher price for their products . <p> " When producers are denied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domestically . <p> " There are also the poor who rely on farming and they will be hurt ( in the process ) because the benefit from lower prices is outweigh by their declining income , while the average income of a farming household in Malaysia is less than typical B40 , " he said in an online press conference today . <p> The press conference was held in conjunction with the launch of the Malaysia Economic Monitor report entitled ' Catching Up : Inclusive Recovery and Growth for Lagging States ' scheduled for this Thursday in Kota Kinabalu . <p> Also present at the press conference was World Bank country manager for Malaysia Dr Yasuhiko Matsuda . <p> Sanghi said a definitive answer to the problem is not easy , but a focus to increase food production , promoting food security and tapping into digitalisation can help Malaysia to overcome the hike in prices . <p> He said it is interesting ( that ) 88 percent of agricultural projects ( in Malaysia ) focus on rice and are rice-related ; 40 to 45 percent of subsidies go towards rice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So the provision of subsidies is something that has to be looked into , he said . <p> He said the war in Ukraine had shown that Malaysia has to look for alternatives for products which have been affected by the war , like fertilisers for example , in order to lower food production cost . <p> Meanwhile , Matsuda said investments in public infrastructure and human capital are vital for states which are lagging in the country , such as Sabah and Kelantan if their economies are to recover well in the post-COVID-19 pandemic era . <p> He said Sabah is currently an agricultural producer and over the long run , Sabah can diversify and catch up with industrialisation , and so attract more investments from other countries . <p> " For example , right now there are investment opportunities from China but is the state ready to be an investment destination ? <p> " Investments in public infrastructure and human capital -- especially in education -- are important .

I 'm just a humble scribe uncertain whether I 'm a federalist and a republican ( the federal minister is right ! ) or a statist and royalist ( the Sultan is right ! ) . <p> Of a more interesting point is this ongoing issue of how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " -- which is nothing more than the usual insecurities many Malay-Muslims suffer from . Their faith is so fragile even the smallest of things -- from saying Merry Christmas to now celebrating Bon Odori -- is a scarily easy way to break it . <p> But who can blame them , after continually being told they 're weak and easily confused ? The irony is that being told this must be the vilest form of disrespect of the Malay-Muslim community ever , and yet it is being perpetrated by the religious ruling class themselves , and goes unpunished . <p> This is what 's called projection , where someone 's own fears and insecurity is projected on another , and then make a big noise about how they 've discovered conspiracies and deceit by powerful hidden enemies . <p> In reality , it is the leaders themselves who are incredibly confused and have fragile , frail faith , but project it on others instead . They 're the ones who should be ashamed for disrespecting Islam by calling Muslims confused . <p> In Malaysia nowadays , the name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by reminding them of it , and always delirious with a siege mentality that says there 's yet another attempt by yet another unnamed dark force out to get them . <p> The fact that in most Muslims countries many such issues are literally non-issues ( who can use the word Allah ? Not an issue in Indonesia , or the Middle East ) shows how scared our people have become . We hear that Islam in Malaysia follows the Wahabi traditions , when in reality we 've created our very own Malay-Muslim Islamic traditions . <p> On a separate note , another of our religious leaders chimed in to say the money earned by a now-retired senior civil servant implicated in a court case , who earned it by doing nothing , is not halal , and should be returned to the people , from whose pockets it came . <p> I certainly applaud that . It 's a refreshing change from the usual halal-haram debates , which mostly are about certificates and traces of DNA in products , or occasionally massive corruption that cheated the ummah into consuming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> While the concepts of halal and haram are really important in Islam , they are often used in Malaysia as just a cover for Malay vs non-Malay racism . Nobody ever questions whether the " ang pows " from corrupt politicians are halal or haram , which is funny , given that we know where most of the money comes from . <p> The retired civil servant , having admitted in court to being paid for doing nothing , is now morally obligated to redress the issue . Would he do it ? Doubt it . He 'd probably adopt the " Apa Malu Bossku " defence , hang tight , do a pilgrimage and repent , and wait for this scandal to blow over . <p> But while I salute this religious leader , I must also ask , why now ? Why not much earlier when the number of cases of such non-halal instances was mountainous , and proven , including through court cases and convictions ? <p> If religious leaders had raised hell about these cases too ( pun intended ) , think of the billions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And we would be spared from watching corrupt and convicted politicians parading around shamelessly . <p> Perhaps because the people involved were , and many still are , powerful people , nobody dared to make any noise . Given that these people are also the same " defenders " of Islam even while they stole money to last for their seven generations , perhaps that 's why they get a free pass . <p> Such are the heroes of Islam nowadays , often scared out of their wits by shadows , and often highly calculative about when and where to stick their neck out , but certainly not slow to project their fears and insecurities to others . <p> Anyway , this matter is now so common that I 'm certain another similar controversy will erupt within weeks . Then the brothers in Islam will bring out their old familiar template ( " Disrespectful " ) , whilst the Sisters in Islam would bring out theirs ( " Overreach " ) . <p> I , too , will dust off my own templates about " insecurities " and keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 
@@91596240 <p> There are many considerations to take into account when deciding on the timing of the country 's next general elections -- not to mention the many players trying to influence the decision . <p> " EVEN the Prime Minister does n't know when GE15 will be held , " is my favourite answer when asked about the timing of the 15th General Election . <p> The PM can stick to his timetable depending on whether he can withstand the pressure coming from his party , Umno , to call for GE15 , is what I 'd add . <p> On June 1 , during Barisan Nasional 's 48th anniversary celebration , Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob -- who is an Umno vice-president -- promised he would not delay , even for a second , the dissolution of Parliament once the coalition was fully prepared . <p> " Prime minister , we are ready to face GE15 , " said Ahmad Zahid , who then asked the 5,000 delegates to stand if they agreed with him . <p> His call received a standing ovation -- except for a few like Communications and Multimedia Minister Annuar Musa of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier , Ismail Sabri told the Nikkei Asia newspaper in Tokyo that " We will have to wait for the right time ( to call for the election ) . We are now facing a period of increasing inflation with high prices ... do you think this is the right time ? " he was quoted as saying . <p> There are two groups within Umno : those who support holding GE15 as soon as possible versus those who want GE15 only after the PM 's full term ends on July 15 , 2023 . Depending on which group they 're with , Umno leaders will inflate or deflate the importance inflation plays in determining when polls should be called . <p> The " as soon as possible " cluster wants the Prime Minister to call for elections now . They fear that inflation will get worse and the rakyat will blame Barisan . <p> " This is rather a strange government . The new normal in which an Umno member is the PM , but Umno is not dominant . <p> " Bersatu controls finance , internal security , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the rakyat will be angry with Umno and not Bersatu , " said an Umno insider , referring to Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia <p> He added that National Recovery Council chairman and Bersatu president Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin is also not in favour of seeing Ismail Sabri serve out his full term . <p> The Umno insider himself feels now is the best time for the PM to seek the consent of the King to dissolve Parliament because the Opposition is in disarray . <p> " We have to act now before the Opposition gets its act together . Now they are fighting among themselves , " he said . <p> As of this week , GE15 would likely be a multi-cornered fight with Barisan versus Pakatan Harapan versus Perikatan Nasional vs small parties like Pejuang . As the Melaka and Johor states polls showed , Barisan , which gained 40% of the popular vote , can win big when the Opposition is split . <p> Obviously , the Opposition -- except for some parties like Parti Warisan -- wants Ismail Sabri to delay polls as long as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as possible " cluster ( made up mostly of party leaders without ministerial posts ) and the " GE15 only after the full term " cluster ( consisting primarily of Umno MPs in the Cabinet ) are negotiating over when would be the best time for GE15 . <p> " It is an odd situation . The party 's vice-president Ismail Sabri must listen to the party president Ahmad Zahid . But the party president must listen to the Prime Minister . It is the prerogative of the PM and not the party to seek consent from the King to dissolve Parliament , " he pointed out . <p> He also revealed that one of the Prime Minister 's considerations in making his decision would be his memorandum of understanding with Pakatan that polls will not be held before July 31 , 2022 . <p> " I believe there is a possibility that elections will be called this year . It can be anytime after July , " he said . <p> The Umno insider 's revelation that the two clusters in the party are still negotiating indicates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hence my argument that even the Prime Minister does n't know when the general elections will be . <p> In the past , the Prime Minister would know roughly when to call for polls . But it is the first time that the Umno president is not the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister is not the Umno president . <p> Has Umno 's " GE15 as soon as possible " cluster run out of options to persuade/force the Umno vice-president to go for snap polls ? <p> " The president of Umno can take disciplinary action against the PM , an Umno vice-president , for defying the party 's order to call for a snap election . So far , the negotiation is amicable , and there is no need to push the panic button yet , " the Umno insider said . <p> But some in Umno 's " GE15 only after the full term " cluster believe that there are influential players who want Ismail Sabri to serve a full term as Prime Minister . <p> Playing devil 's advocate , I said : " But they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after GE15 as Umno has named him its poster boy for GE15 , right ?

@@92022240 <p> There are often two noticeable elements when it comes to co-living -- the cost savings through the sharing of facilities and amenities , while still having one 's privacy and personal space , and the sense of community among the residents of the space . <p> According to Rahim &amp; Co International Sdn Bhd director of research Sulaiman Saheh , co-living is seen as a way of having an affordable living space by sharing costs and common areas with other residents without completely forgoing your privacy . The concept embodies a more communal way of living as opposed to the traditional , more isolated single-dweller home . <p> " This niche asset is favoured as a complementary product in an integrated development , especially in transit-oriented developments ( TODs ) and commercial and education hubs . The concept was born out of the co-working and sharing economy culture that is growing among millennials and the young working population , " he says . <p> " Just as with hotels and shared rental homes , anyone can seek residence in a co-living home for any reason and length of time . Suited more for individuals who desire to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of residence , co-living offers a range of options at various price points without having to choose between outright budget hostels and hotels . " <p> Savills Malaysia Sdn Bhd managing director Datuk Paul Khong says the definition of space use in co-living gets more creative when the common area is used as a place to relax , collaboration zone or game space , which may attract and benefit potential renters . Such settings often lead to collaboration and the formation of a community among like-minded individuals who are juggling their work and personal lives . <p> Based on several Savills research publications , co-living is gaining in popularity because of the ever-increasing development costs , housing unaffordability and , in some cases , acute housing shortage in cities like Hong Kong , London and Singapore . <p> Co-living also appears to be a solution for young adults or fresh graduates before they own their first home or start climbing the corporate ladder . " Driven by the perks of a hassle-free system , sociable environment and easy access to lifestyle facilities in just one bill , co-living appeals to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space . This is where operators are rolling out new innovative schemes that offer wider facilities to entice renters , " says Khong . <p> " For instance , co-living in Australia sprung from the conventional and already mature purpose-built student accommodation ( PBSA ) property sub-sector . The existing strong foundation in the PBSA sector has installed strong momentum for such divergence to a new differentiation such as the evolution of the co-living concept . The success of co-living is in response to the 1.46 million population in the 24 to 39 age group who rent homes across the country . " <p> Sulaiman notes that there are several similarities between student accommodation and co-living . However , on top of the restriction of having only students as residents , student accommodation may not be as fully equipped as a co-living space , as the primary reason is to provide the students with a shared residence near their education institution . But in co-living spaces , residents are of diverse ages and backgrounds , including their marital and employment status . <h> Co-living in Malaysia <p> The co-living trend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in central locations such as Greater Kuala Lumpur , according to Khong , and that the residential rental market then was rather mixed in terms of property types . " The operating concept of co-living schemes in Greater KL is similar to that overseas , which targets digital nomads , foreign working individuals and professionals , and frequent travellers , " he says . <p> An upcoming co-living development to look out for is The Ascott Ltd 's lyf in Jalan Raja Chulan , KL , which is slated for completion this year . <p> Sulaiman says developments that are intentionally designed and commercialised around the concept of co-living is still relatively new and more of a novelty in Malaysia . Co-living developments are still finding a foothold in the local market . <p> However , when compared with the traditional renting of housing , involving several housemates who share the same space , co-living seems to be a revamped version with better quality facilities and proper management by an operator who acts as the landlord . <p> Globally , the co-living concept has been steadily gaining traction , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to adopt the nomadic lifestyle . <p> " Co-living has not gained popularity in Malaysia as it has in places like Hong Kong and the UK because of the nomadic lifestyle that is practised there , which goes hand in hand with co-living . By comparison , stable long-term home renting or outright homeownership is more prevalent in the Malaysian residential market , " says Sulaiman . <p> " Also , some argue that co-living arrangements are viewed as an alternative accommodation arrangement . A more compact living arrangement , but with the convenience of contemporary facilities and modern communal setting at a price tag that is lower than having to rent a whole apartment unit , provides the option for young urbanites to stay close to the city . " <p> He adds that developers have been using co-living accommodation as a new way to market or rent out units through an operator without having to use the term " rental housing " , which has a cheaper undertone to it . <p> While the bigger picture may still show housemates renting a unit together , the premium facilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to differentiate them from the traditional homes shared by a group of friends . <p> " Normally , landlords of traditional homes would provide prioritised and standard facilities such as the dining and television areas and kitchen . But with co-living , the range of offerings are extended to appeal to a wider range of urbanite tenants , which includes cosy patios , rooftop barbecue and garden areas as well as working spaces like meeting rooms and hot desks . To further elevate these spaces are high quality finishing , contemporary interior designs and modern furnishings , " says Sulaiman . <p> " Tenants may bring in their own items and decorate them for a more personal touch . But this is subject to the terms set by the co-living operator as the spaces must remain shareable and universal for easy exchange of tenants . Some co-living developments may include a sort of at-home office area shared by the tenants for work and a common lounge for socialising . " <p> Khong concurs . " Co-living units are fully furnished to make the renters ' stay totally hassle-free and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the units comfortable . " <p> Sulaiman believes the main challenge of building co-living developments is competing with the option of simply buying one 's own residence , though it could be a small unit , if the monthly cost of co-living is comparable with paying a monthly mortgage . <p> The security and safety features that come with home ownership remain strong in the Asian culture . Therefore , the often-mentioned benefit of flexibility in co-living does not hold up against the desire to own a permanent home . <h> Post-pandemic co-living trend <p> Khong says that with the Covid-19 pandemic , co-living operators are working to maintain occupancy levels and revisiting how they can operate innovatively in managing shared spaces and facilities while continuing to adapt to the new norms post-pandemic . <p> Consequently , the co-living business in Malaysia will continue to grow when the pandemic eventually subsides , says Khong . " The established corporate entrants venturing into the co-living business in pre-pandemic times with their respective standalone buildings mirror the movement in established cities , by having purpose-built assets to create quality rental space , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real estate sector definitions for co-living spaces is similar to the injection of co-working space into the purpose-built office and some commercial-titled high-rise residential developments . As remote working will be one of the working modes post-pandemic , there is more potential for new openings , especially in suburban addresses , and this demand will be enhanced over time . " <p> Sulaiman notes that co-living may likely be the future of temporary housing for individuals who have yet to find their permanent place of residence but are still able to afford and experience a good quality of life as a tenant in core urban areas . <p> Moving forward , more demand may likely come from the younger generation , who are less attached to the idea of permanent ownership and may find a communal environment more appealing , as opposed to the more private and isolated homes . <p> " With the ever-changing demographics and changes in lifestyle , the needs and priorities of new and young urbanites of the future that embrace the nomadic work culture may fuel the growth of this niche market , synergising with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Sulaiman . <h> Co-living abroad <p> In cities like Hong Kong , co-living has gained in popularity as it addresses some real social needs , says Colliers Asia senior director of valuation and advisory services Shaman Chellaram . <p> The sector has sustained occupancy rates of between 80% and 95% , and its offerings range from budget solutions to premium products . Hong Kong is a densely populated city and the least affordable housing market globally , thus property supply is limited , especially in key urban areas . <p> " The average house size is very small at about 400 sq ft and the space can be tight for a family . Most individuals struggle to buy or rent a place of their own , especially one that is well designed with good facilities in a core urban location . Rental periods in the private market are 12 to 24 months and provide limited flexibility that includes the additional cost of furnishings and utilities , " says Shaman . <p> Colliers Hong Kong associate director of valuation and advisory services Pureanae Jang notes that co-living operators address such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accessible locations with more flexible lease terms , and co-living has become an affordable option for young professionals who want to be more independent . <p> The sector serves a tangible need in the market and is an important new rung on the housing ladder . It provides young professionals with a different option in the market with a higher perceived value socially and economically , at the given price point . <p> " The success of co-living developments will ultimately depend on each operator 's ability to target the end-user and curate the right ecosystem for residents to be part of the wider community and the benefits that this provides . We are also seeing some co-living operators pivot to cover the wider rental housing/serviced apartment market in recent months , thereby providing their customer base with a wider product offering , " says Jang . <p> " In Malaysia , meanwhile , where the cost of living and housing is cheaper on a relative basis to Hong Kong , people may opt to buy or rent , or live with their parents . While the wider Malaysian market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already showing signs of growth in this sector . " <p> Likewise , co-living is evolving in London as it is not just simply renting a room , but by providing a social element and communal spaces for people to interact . " The changing work patterns , rising loneliness , chronic undersupply of rental accommodation and the emergence of the shared economy have also contributed to the growth of co-living there , " says Knight Frank Malaysia executive director of capital markets James Buckley . <p> " Additionally , the high house price-to-income ratio of 14.5 times makes it difficult for young professionals to get on the property ladder . For instance , a first-time homebuyer would need to pay a deposit of ? 100,000 for an average London house priced at ? 490,000 . " <p> Knight Frank London head of build-to-rent and funding Jonathan Stevenson reckons that optionality and affordability are key factors that drive the demand for co-living in London . " It provides a step up for those recently out of higher education or new into the workplace , and this is typically the demographic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of young people here are unable to afford build-to-rent ( BTR ) or traditional private rental costs , so co-living provides a welcome step up from student accommodation , allowing tenants to establish themselves work-wise , " he explains . <p> " Following this , the next stage is advancing to a BTR block , private rental or a purchase . Lack of stock is also driving demand , whereby renters want to live in co-living schemes but there are limited operational ones available . Subsequently , co-living is not the future of housing , it does , however , provide another option and gives greater flexibility to the renter . As it develops , there will be more demand for it from both a product and investment perspective , and as schemes are completed and tenants become more aware of the options available to them , the take-up rate will increase . " <p> Knight Frank Malaysia executive director of research and consultancy Judy Ong says that although the segment 's share of London 's housing market may be small , co-living is a growing concept and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ co-living developments here would generally offer fewer facilities due to the smaller-scale or niche projects . <p> Compared with London , the co-living trend in KL is emerging at a slower pace , driven in part by affordability issues that make it difficult for young single professionals to own a property , particularly if they want to live in the city centre , says Buckley . It is also a cheaper alternative to renting an entire apartment or house that requires a 2+1-month cash deposit as well as the utilities , broadband and furnishing costs . <p> " The co-living market in Malaysia will need to cater for those with lower incomes and , thus , are quite cost-sensitive . The challenge for those who want to get into this niche segment is that they will need to find opportunities close to good transport or infrastructure that can be developed or converted while generating a decent investment return , " he adds . <p> Ong reckons that moving forward , co-living presents an opportunity for key players to secure a first-mover advantage in this largely untapped market . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evaluate the characteristics of their proposed developments or investments ( assets ) amid prevailing market sentiments before venturing into this niche segment , taking into consideration the development , refurbishment or repurposing costs , where relevant .

@@93229231 <p> In the latest news of cryptocurrency , anticipation is in full mode as the date set for the Ethereum Merge draws close . <p> Since Ethereum launched for the first time in 2015 , The Merge is its most significant update till date . Highly anticipated and poised to change the world of crypto forever , the upgrade will see a major overhaul of the very model upon which the Ethereum blockchain is built . The Merge will see the blockchain migrate from the proof of work model to a proof of stake model . And is expected to begin on 6 September . According to the project team , the old blockchain will be switched off at some point between September 10 and September 20 . <p> But crypto enthusiasts have mixed expectations of the upcoming upgrade . Some see it as a welcome development , believing that if all works out as planned , there 'll be faster transactions and energy efficiency on the blockchain will be greatly improved . For others , there are fears that the proof of stake model will make the blockchain less secure . Whatever might be the case , here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to happen once the upgrade is completed . <p> Reduced energy consumption <p> One of the major expectations of the Ethereum Merge is that it will reduce energy consumption , albeit significantly . Before now , the proof of work model used an underlying technology that required a great amount of electricity to validate crypto transactions . <p> To put that into perspective , ethereum mining is currently estimated to require electricity of about 72 terawatt-hours a year . It might be interesting to note that that is nearly as much power as the whole of Colombia consumes in the same period . Furthermore , the carbon emissions that come from ethereum mining is also nearly equivalent to that of Switzerland . <p> However , as earlier confirmed by the Ethereum Foundation , the planned upgrade will mean that there will be no more need for the role of miners in the ethereum ecosystem . The Foundation also says carbon emissions will be reduced by over 99% , which translates to near-zero emissions . So , this means that electricity usage will be reduced to the barest minimum . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ethereum with its planned upgrade , there are still potential problems ahead . Expectedly , a transition of such magnitude will come with a lot of confusion on the part of users . So it might not be surprising to see hackers preying on the vulnerabilities of users in this period . <p> It is as a result of this possibility that the Ethereum Foundation recently put out a warning . The organization wrote : <p> " You should be on high alert for scams trying to take advantage of users during this transition . " <p> The foundation further added that users need not do anything as the transition will be automatic , and funds will remain safe regardless . Therefore , they should be wary of scams asking them to send their ETH anywhere for the upgrade . <p> Proof of stake , a model of the moment <p> For what it 's worth , proof of stake is fast becoming a model to reckon with amongst blockchains . Blockchains that have used the technology so far include Solana and Cardano . While a few others are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transitioning in a few days , however , Bitcoin will be at the mercies of critics for its unrelenting support for proof of work . Especially as the latter uses nearly 130 terawatts hours of electricity a year , a figure that might not be justifiable if the ethereum blockchain proves it could achieve similar potentials with less energy consumption . 
@@93229232 <h> Is Losing Weight Easier Than Ever ? <p> Julie <p> June 30 , 2022 <p> News <p> When I was younger I was very overweight . A lifetime of snacking and over indulging on fast food had left me addicted and unable to get the pounds off . I first started my weight loss journey back in the 80s . And at the time gym technology was alright , but was leagues behind where it is today . It seemed everything I tried was met with failure . <p> I ca n't blame it all on technology of course . I was very much to blame as well . I never took it seriously and I could n't keep up the motivation in the face of such a daunting task . But these days I am happy to say I have lost a significant amount of weight and am now at my comfortable goal weight . <p> It was around 2015 that something finally clicked and I started to lose the pounds . Last year I looked back over this and I wondered why it suddenly became so easy ? Was it my positive mental attitude ? Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am here to look at the question : Is losing weight easier than ever ? <h> A Shift In The Global Mentality <p> One of the biggest differences between my weight loss journey in the past and in 2015 was social media . This might seem surprising , but when I looked at all the contributing factors I found this was one of the most useful . But how did social media help me ? <p> Social media as a tool has connected us all together in ways we never thought possible only a few years ago . We can communicate with our friends and families from across the globe and share what is going in in our lives . And social media has also helped shift our collective mentality on a lot of subjects . Including fitness . <p> During my weight loss journey I started following a lot of fitness influencers . Not the gym bro ones , but people who looked like me who had gone through the grueling weight loss process . I found a community of like minded people from all over the globe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it also meant I could share my issues and successes with them . Suddenly I found myself more motivated than ever before because I had this community behind me every step of the way . <h> Access To More Information <p> This ties into social media . The internet has changed so much and we now have access to a huge wealth of information at the press of a button . Which is why it is now easier than ever before to lose weight , because we have access to the best information , dieting , and workout tips available . Previously you could only get this info from word of mouth or books . And these were often unreliable sources . <p> But social media and search engines now means we can access a lot of scientifically based and peer reviewed information . And influencers and YouTubers provide us with in-depth reviews of products and workout regimes they have tried and found that work . So for a lot of people it is now easier to lose weight as the information is more readily available . This is especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to avoid going to the gym or places like that . <h> Better Supplements And Medications <p> Modern medicine is a miracle worker . The things we can do with drugs and supplements these days are outstanding . I wish I had access to the best belly fat burner back in the 80s when I first started to lose weight . These days you can buy a wealth of weight loss products over-the-counter without any hassle or fuss . <p> These products work in a few different ways . Fat burners specifically boost your metabolism . Your metabolism determines how quickly the food turns food into fat and also how quickly the body turns fat back into energy when you work out . So using them with a good workout regime is guaranteed to help shed off the pounds . Appetite suppressants do what the name suggests . They stifle your appetite so you do n't get as hungry throughout the day and resist the urge to keep snacking . They are a modern day wonder as far as I 'm concerned . <h> Better Tracking Technology <p> Back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight loss process was a scale in my bathroom . And it was n't the most reliable of things . But modern technology has taken leaps and bounds in the workout tracking department . We now have products such as FitBits or smart watches . These fantastic devices can track almost everything about us . <p> They monitor our daily steps . They track our pulse and heart rate . And they can even tell us how many calories we have burnt in a day or during a specific workout . This is fantastic for your weight loss journey as you can do a lot with all this information . You can monitor your caloric intake vs your energy expenditure and ensure you are eating enough . You can see how well you are progressing with your workouts . And you can sync all the data up with certain workout apps to monitor your progress in real time and set yourself goals . Which has been proven to be a great way to keep yourself motivated . <h> The Death Of Fast Food <p> One of the biggest issues with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cheapest food was very unhealthy . The fast food industries were in their golden age . Their products were cheap and addictive and people did n't yet understand how harmful they were for our health . <p> These days we are far more aware of just how bad these products are for us . And a lot more countries are putting tougher regulations on the various fast food companies . Which is a huge boost for anyone trying to lose weight . As our knowledge of healthy food improves and our ability to get access to unhealthy food decreases , we will all find it easier to lose weight .

@@93253232 <p> You might have seen them around if you travel around Subang Jaya , but now it 's official -- MBSJ 's new two-hour parking lots have come into effect from September 1 2022 . <p> The new two-hour parking lots are marked with an orange border and say " 2 jam " in the middle of the lot . Other than the time limit , they are also more expensive to park in , priced at 50 sen for half an hour instead of 50 sen for an hour . If you park in one of these lots but pay the normal parking lot fee , you are deemed to have not paid for parking and will be liable to be fined . Here 's how to properly pay for the new two-hour lots in order to avoid getting fined . <h> Download the Smart Selangor parking app <p> Firstly you must download the Smart Selangor Parking or the Flexi Parking app .

They 're also waiting for Chancellor of the Exchequer Kwasi Kwarteng to return to London from Washington , where he has been attending meetings of the International Monetary Fund , the person said . <p> The premier could scrap her pledge to keep corporation tax at its current level next year -- and instead raise it as originally planned by her predecessor Boris Johnson 's administration , the Sun reported . <p> The pound surged 1.8% on Thursday to US$1.1295 .

Under a strategy set out by the previous Conservative administration , the levy on companies was due to rise to 25% from 19% in April . But scrapping that move was one of the key measures in Kwarteng 's fiscal plan announced Sept 23 . <p> The package roiled markets , sending the pound at one point to an all-time low against the dollar , and forcing the Bank of England to intervene in the bond market to prevent a collapse . It also left a hole in the public purse that the influential Institute of Fiscal Studies estimates at ? 60 billion . <h> BOE <p> BOE Governor Andrew Bailey put his credibility on the line this week when he told investors that gilt-buying programme will end as planned on Friday , brushing off calls to extend the market support .

" <p> The initial market reaction suggests that a U-turn on corporation tax along with the bank 's greater buying activity this week could help ease any turbulence next week , when the BOE has withdrawn its safety net .

On Thursday , Foreign Secretary James Cleverly refused to commit to the plan when asked by Sky News whether there would be any more reversals , particularly on corporation tax . <p> He responded by listing measures the government is determined to keep , but made no mention of corporation tax . <p> " The foundations of that mini-budget , protecting people from energy bill prices , letting them keep more of their earnings , protecting businesses form those energy prices , making sure that we 're internationally competitive , all those things are really key , " Cleverly said . <p> Asked again whether the government would stick with the plan on corporation taxes , he replied : " It 's absolutely right that we 've made it clear that we want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Idea ' <p> Speaking to reporters at a regular briefing , Truss 's spokesman Max Blain said the government 's position on taxes has not changed . <p> But Cleverly 's refusal to explicitly back the plan will fuel speculation that the government is preparing to backtrack on more of last month 's fiscal package , which took the financial markets by surprise by going further and faster in cutting taxes that Truss had suggested during the Conservative leadership campaign over the summer . <p> With market uncertainty persisting and the central bank 's intervention due to end Friday , even members of Truss 's party are urging her to unpick her economic strategy and restore the party 's reputation for economic credibility . <p> Despite the dire polling numbers facing the Tories and Truss personally , Cleverly also told Sky News that changing leader now " would be a disastrously bad idea , not just politically but economically " .

It has changed the supply chain forever , including for the trade in food . <p> Second , the trade war and decoupling of China and the US have spilled over to the food trade as well . The trade war will intensify in the foreseeable future . <p> The third factor complicating matters is the Russia-Ukraine war that began on Feb 24 . Prior to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global wheat supply and Russia was the largest exporter of fertiliser in the world . <p> The fourth , and likely the most important development , is climate change . <p> The incidence of extreme heat waves , followed by droughts and unprecedented floods that occurred in countries like Pakistan combined to reduce global food supply . <p> The scale and intensity of these disasters jarred climate change deniers out of their complacency and forced them to acknowledge that climate change presented a challenge that policymakers had to factor into their calculations of the future . <p> In Malaysia , virtually overnight , food security became a matter that both government and opposition politicians had to reckon with . How do we as a country prepare for the looming food security crisis ? <p> I would like to propose five action items to make Malaysia more resilient in the agriculture and food industry . <h> 1 . Agricultural land reform <p> Land is key to all agricultural advancement . If more land is allocated to farmers , more food can be produced . Peninsular Malaysia currently has eight million hectares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 75% , are allocated to oil palm plantations . Another one million hectares , or 12.5% , are for rubber plantations . This leaves only one million hectares for all agro-food activities , including rice growing , vegetable farming , fruit farming , rearing of ruminants and fish and shrimp cultivation . The limited supply of land has severely hindered agricultural advancement in Malaysia . <p> With limited land available , small farmers often face a multitude of problems . New entrants to farming have difficulty applying for agricultural land . <p> Small farmers are often given small plots of land , averaging two to three acres . They also face short land leases , which sometimes require annual renewals . As a result , they are unwilling to invest in technology and grow their farm business . <p> Ironically , big corporations have no problem applying for thousands of acres from the government . From Baling in Kedah to Raub in Pahang , to the Lojing Highlands in Kelantan , big companies can obtain thousands of acres for durian plantations and vegetable growing . In contrast , small farmers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food security , the effort must be premised on agricultural land reform . <p> Reforms must take the shape of land redistribution . There must be a proper plan to allocate more agricultural land for food farming . <p> The available land must be transparent and open to genuine farmers . The land tenure must be long enough for farmers to grow their business . <p> The state governments must work hard to eradicate rent seekers who lease agricultural land and rent it to farmers . This systemic problem has burdened genuine farmers and caused food prices to go up . <p> Agricultural land reform must be comprehensive and should cover all states in Malaysia . We must engage with all stakeholders -- the state governments , farmers and the custodians of the National Land Code -- and all legal matters . <p> The solutions must be comprehensive such that agricultural development becomes sustainable . <p> For agricultural land reform to happen , I would like to suggest that the federal government , through the National Land Council , which is chaired by the prime minister , take the lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will ensure that the recommendations of the council and its road map will be applicable to all states . State governments must not resist change . The current restrictions on agricultural land have seriously curtailed the development of the agriculture sector . For things to change , state governments must change too . <h> 2 . Technology in farming <p> Farming used to be seen as backward and unsophisticated . With new farming technology , modern farming is now a high-tech , high-investment business . <p> Modern farming can apply technology to the entire supply chain . Take vegetable farms . Modern vegetable farming started with laboratory research to produce quality seeds . After that , farmers invested in modern greenhouses with Internet of Things-based climate control and optimisation of fertiliser application to save costs and prevent wastage . <p> Modern vegetable farms can use high-definition cameras to identify pests and release biocontrol agents to control pests . Harvesting can also be done with modern automation systems . Vegetable factories can be set up in urban areas where LED lighting is used to replace sunlight . <p> Modern paddy planting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then use drones to apply fertilisers and pesticides and use GPS-guided autonomous vehicles to harvest . <p> These farming technologies are already in the market . In a few years , they will be fully commercialised and will transform the agriculture sector . Malaysian farmers must quickly change their mindset , embrace change and adopt these technologies in stages . <p> Technology can transform our agricultural sector into a high-yield , high-efficiency modern farming industry . It will reduce costs of production and make our ex-farm prices competitive . With higher yields and stable supply , we can import less vegetables and rice from abroad . This will improve food security in Malaysia . <h> 3 . Malaysia as an agriculture exporting nation <p> Malaysia has long been a successful trading nation . We must not look inward and just think about self-sufficiency . The country must work towards export-based agriculture . Our objective should be set at producing international quality farm products . <p> When we set a national objective to be an agriculture exporting nation , our agriculture policies , education policies and trading policies will change to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quality of our farm products to meet international standards . We will intensify our R&amp;D to generate products based on importing countries ' requirements . We will also refocus our education policies to educate more farming experts and agronomists . Our trade representatives around the world will focus on finding new markets for our farm products . <p> Malaysia as an agriculture exporting nation is not a dream . We have been successful in exporting palm oil to the world . We are currently a big exporter of shrimps to the US and Europe . We are exporting tomatoes to the Middle East . We are also exporting vegetables and poultry to Singapore and Brunei . <p> By making Malaysia an agriculture exporting nation , we can greatly improve the quality and quantity of our farm products . By improving quality and yields , it will benefit the country in terms of food security and food safety . <h> 4 . Work on Malaysia 's comparative advantages <p> Food trade across the world started thousands of years ago . There were silk roads as well as spice routes from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food trade will increase by leaps and bounds . Therefore , for Malaysia 's agriculture to thrive , we must work on our comparative advantages . <p> Malaysia has several comparative advantages . Palm oil is one of the best crops that we produce . In terms of food crops , Malaysia 's tropical fruits segment , such as durians and pineapples , as well as poultry , fish and shrimp farming , are success stories . We can further work on several emerging sectors such as modern vegetable farming to reduce our reliance on imports . <p> In 2021 , Malaysia imported RM63 billion worth of food . This was an alarming situation . But if we improve our agricultural sector , we can greatly reduce our food import bill . If we further improve our comparative advantages by exporting more high-value agricultural products such as palm oil , fish , poultry , durians and pineapples , we can improve the balance of trade and even make food trade a surplus . <h> 5 . Attracting talent and investments in agriculture <p> Just like any other business , agriculture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the long return on investment and the lack of talent in the sector . For example , investments in durian farms are big and will only start bearing fruit after seven years . Malaysian universities hardly produce graduates in agriculture . Without passionate farmers and experts , farms will fail . <p> To attract talent and investments , governments must incentivise investments . When farmers see potential profits , they will invest and draw new farmers into the sector . <p> To be fair , the government is currently giving tax-free incentives for agriculture investments for 10 years . However , the application process is long and complicated . Most farming companies complain that they fail to get the tax exemption status . <p> The Ministry of Finance does not have enough expertise to evaluate investments in agriculture . It is currently focusing on big investments , while the vast majority of small farmers can hardly get tax incentives . I urge MoF to seriously reform the current tax exemption application process and system . It must be made easy for farmers , who are often not sophisticated enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make money from agriculture , they will produce more . <p> In conclusion , the government of Malaysia after the 15th general election must have the vision and mission to tackle food security . I had the honour of being deputy minister of agriculture , a stint that afforded me an understanding of our food security challenges . <p> It is not a dream to improve food security in Malaysia . It can be done . We need the vision , right policy and right implementation to get there .

In addition to traditional print media , journalism now includes online news media , such as blogs , podcasts , and social media . The practice of journalism is based on a set of principles that promote accuracy , fairness , and transparency . Journalists are expected to seek out the truth and report it without bias .

There 's even a physical MAE card that you can apply for , allowing you to make purchases using the eWallet . <p> You can still perform online banking transactions through the MAE app , such as transferring money , paying bills and making purchases via QRPay . But these functions are cast off to the side , and in fact , MAE 's online banking features are right at the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apple App Store and Google Play Store . This led me to believe MAE is a companion app to M2U MY , rather than being Maybank 's default app -- and I 'm sure I 'm not the only one . <p> That 's the problem with the " super app " approach favoured by a growing number of companies . Sure , MAE 's broad spectrum of features are nice to have , but as a banking app , I should have my banking functions front and centre . And honestly , who wants to use a Maybank app to buy flight tickets , or a house ? <p> Yes , I understand I sound like a Luddite who 's unwilling to try new things , even if they might actually turn out to be better . And yes , I do have the opposite problem of having too many apps -- something that my colleagues have chided me on more than once . So whether you choose to use MAE or M2U MY is purely personal preference . But there 's another , more pressing issue with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually more secure <p> Maybank 's claim that MAE is a more secure app than M2U MY is undermined by one glaring flaw . While a six-digit PIN ( or fingerprint or facial recognition ) can be used to unlock certain features , for full functionality you 'll need to sign in using your password . <p> For reasons unbeknown to us , however , Maybank has blocked autofill with its password field , preventing password managers from working properly . If you auto-generated a Maybank2u password and saved it , it wo n't show up on your keyboard . <p> This means you 'll have to go to the manager app you 're using ( or the phone 's settings if you use iCloud Keychain or Google Password Manager ) , copy the password , then go back to the MAE app to paste it . This discourages people from using an auto-generated complex password in favour of something that 's easy to remember , ironically making the app less secure than M2U MY . <p> Now , some users have remarked that certain password managers like SafeInCloud Pro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Android will pop up the password instead of autofilling it . But these seem to be exceptions rather than the rule -- in our experience , MAE does n't play nice with either 1Password or iCloud Keychain . <p> Unfortunately , Maybank is not alone with this . Banks do have a tendency of blocking autofill , with one user pointing out that CIMB , Hong Leong Bank , Tabung Haji and Bank Islam all implement some form of blocking . And it 's not just local banks that are guilty of this . <p> According to CNET , an Australian bank , CommBank , once actively discouraged password managers , saying that while it saw the value in these services , hackers could trick customers into revealing their passwords through sophisticated phishing schemes . But those are exactly the sort of schemes that password managers are designed to prevent -- if the autofill does n't pop up , something is up . In any case , forcing users to remember passwords that are likely weak or reused is hardly the last word in safety . <h> Reminder : Activating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you feel about the MAE app , you 'll need to be braced for a bit of a wait before you can use it on your new phone . Starting last week , Maybank implemented a 12-hour activation period , which comes into effect whenever you enrol a new device into Secure2u . This effectively puts a freeze on all banking transactions that require authorisation , with the exception of transfers marked as favourites . <p> This happened to me this week when I was making a purchase at a shop that inexplicably only accepted bank transfers and not cards -- requiring a slightly embarrassing walk to the nearest ATM . It 's unfortunate that users will likely only encounter this when they need to make transactions the most , which is why we 're reminding you to activate Secure2u ( or your bank 's own two-factor authorisation ) as soon as possible if you bought a new phone , lest you end up in the same situation . <p> To do so through the MAE app , tap on " More " on the bottom navigation bar , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on " Activate Now , " confirm your number and wait for the OTP SMS ( oh , the irony ) . After that , input your IC number , passport number or any other ID number registered to your account , then assign a name to your device . Then you 're done ! <p> Maybank says the 12-hour " cooling-off " period , as mandated by Bank Negara , gives users time to retrieve the phone or report it as stolen if the device falls into the wrong hands ; CIMB added a similar system recently for its SecureTAC feature . Not all banks have to implement a 12-hour period -- Public Bank 's Secure Sign requires you to go to an ATM or branch to activate it . It 's an old-school method , but one that 's perhaps more secure , as it requires you to actually be present for authorisation.

Since unifying its financial services under one umbrella , ie its lending business and e-wallet business last year , overall growth was over 25% with a Gross Transaction Value ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2021 . As at end June 2022 , its consumer business , Boost Life hit 10.1 million users on the back of a 10.5% year on year growth while Boost Business saw its merchant touchpoints grow by 43.1% to hit 505,000 . <p> Note that touchpoints means that a business could have five outlets and that means five touchpoints , assuming all the outlets are Boost customers . <p> Many businesses would love to have such an annual performance . Yet , the financial metrics for Boost 's 1H2022 performance paints a sobering picture of the long path to profitability . Revenue in 1H2022 stood at RM31 million versus RM28 million in the same period in 2021 with the 11.9% increase driven more by Boost Credit , the lending business that used to be called Aspirasi . Despite the revenue uptick it had a negative EBIT for 1H2022 of RM107 million and a negative PATAMI ( or net loss ) of RM101 million . <p> RM1 = US$0.222 <p> Focusing more efforts in delivering value to business and consumer users <p> Still , the strong rise in the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , with Boost Life users nearly doubling to 10 million and merchant base quadrupling , with over 50% being micro SMEs , leads Boost Group 's CEO , Sheyantha Abeykoon ( pic ) to declare , " We believe we have gone beyond market penetration and are more focused on usage . " <p> In other words , it is spending less on the costly exercise and imperfect science of user acquisition , and focusing more efforts in delivering value to its business and consumer users . <p> The signs are promising . As of Q3 2021 , 67% of Boost Life users have been using the ewallet for their day-to-day usage . Boost induces that people are carrying less cash and digital payments are becoming the current preferred method for many Malaysians . <p> Meanwhile GTV for 1H2022 stood at a strong RM2.9 billion or 26.8% increase over the same period in 2021 . This was despite headwinds Boost has observed from micro-economic challenges and where some small businesses are struggling to restart their businesses . And then there is the strong competition from the likes of Grab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Economic conditions aside , Boost has noticed consistent challenges that other research have pinpointed as well , which micro SMEs in Malaysia face when embarking on their digitalisation journeys . For instance : <p> A misconception of the costs of digitalisation <p> Low access and awareness to financing <p> Lack of digital savviness especially amongst the older generation <p> And , not knowing where to start with so many digital providers offering services <p> Sheyantha says Boost rolled out a two-prong approach to tackle this . " The first is our constant advocacy in promoting digital payment adoption as a simple stepping stone to a access a wider range of digital financial services and business solutions . " <p> For instance , its data shows that 70% of Boost Merchants start applying for micro-financing and micro-insurance within the year of being onboarded . Sharing some data , Sheyantha notes that overall , comparing 2021 to 2020 , total micro-insurance policies sold increased by over 160% . <p> To date ( as of end June ) , we have disbursed about RM1 billion worth of loans in Malaysia , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other financial service providers before . " Its non-performing loan ratio is below 4% in Malaysia . <p> The second approach Boost has taken is to work together with partners like MDEC to help mSMEs shift online at zero cost to build more sustainable and resilient businesses . Last year , Boost rolled out the Go-eCommerce Onboarding campaign that reached an uptake of 42% . According to Sheyantha , " this shows MSMEs ' greater willingness and awareness of the need to digitalise their businesses . " <p> Embeding its services into the existing micro SME transaction journey <p> At the same time , Boost has also learned to adopt its message . " We believe it 's important to bring the technology to our customers instead of trying to change their behavior . " <p> On a practical level , this means trying to embed its services into the existing transaction journey that the business already has . Sheyantha says Boost finds that this is a more effective way to get early adopters with Boost integrating its lending solutions via the application programming interface ( API ) into existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepping stone analogy is well borne out by the strong growth that its AI-lending unit , Boost Credit , has enjoyed since 2020 . " Before the pandemic , loans disbursed averaged at RM3.7 million per month and by May 2021 , this increased to RM30 million . Currently , it has soared to between RM50 million - RM60 million per month on average as Malaysia transitioned to the endemic phase , " he says . <p> Ed : Para edited for clarity . <p> Helping it manage this surge in loans , while keeping NPLs below 4% means a heavy reliance on data and AI . But here , Sheyantha makes an interesting point . " Our view is that data and AI is not a competitive advantage , but more of a hygiene practice for any digital company . For micro-financing , leveraging data has helped us carry out preliminary financial checks and assess credit risk and improve how we underwrite and credit score MSMEs , as well as create a much better loan book quality , " he says . <p> With its journey of going beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Axiata , Sheyantha describes Boost as a company excited over its journey to further drive financial inclusion amongst underserved segments .

But we have n't seen one that checks your blood pressure -- at least one that has been approved by regulatory authorities . Until now -- say hello to the Huawei Watch D , the first smartwatch with a blood pressure monitor that 's been certified by Malaysia 's Medical Device Authority . <p> The Watch D is available for pre-order from December 12 until 23 , priced at RM1,999 . This makes the device more expensive here than in other markets -- CNY2,988 ( about RM1,887 ) in China and just IDR5,479,000 ( about RM1,549 ) in Indonesia . <p> Unlike other smartwatches like the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 and 5 , which uses pulse wave analysis to measure blood pressure , the Watch D features a mini pump that inflates a dual-layer airbag in the strap at a maximum pressure of 40kPa whenever you initiate a blood pressure check . <p> To maximise the precision of the readings , the device also includes a high-precision pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the macromolecular tensile strap has a butterfly clasp .

There was a lot of variety and a lot of expectation in a lot of the products , but not everything stuck the landing . Still , it 's important we memorialise these moments , not just to give recognition when things succeed , but also to act as an earmark for its place in history . <p> This segment of the awards is to recognise the ups , the downs , the movers and the makers of 2022 . We asked the whole team to submit nominations for what they thought were the biggest surprises , disappointments , tech brands and their ultimate gadgets of 2022 . From that extensive list , we compiled and shortlisted the nominations before a panel consisting of Amin Ashaari , Alexander Wong , Najib Hamid , Raymond Saw , Jonathan Lee , Hanif Azrai , and Sudarshan Duke ultimately picked the winners . <h> Gadget of the Year <h> Hyundai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is simultaneously not a gadget and an absolutely massive one . It 's really a form of transportation , but it runs on electricity , comes with giant screens , packs several interesting features and looks like it drove straight out of Cyberpunk 2077 . <p> OK , so it does n't actually have the most advanced tech , lacking USB-C ports and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto . But on the flip side , it can act as the world 's largest powerbank , thanks to the nifty vehicle-to-load ( V2L ) function . While the tech world ended up being surprisingly flat this year , the Ioniq 5 captured the zeitgeist of the Malaysian automotive market in 2022 , which is why we had to give it our biggest gong -- the Gold award for Gadget of the Year . <h> DJI Avata -- SILVER WINNER <p> Mind you , if you 're looking for the coolest thing you can get your hands on this holiday season , the DJI Avata should definitely be near the top of your list . It 's a drone , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blends the thrills you get from all three . And if you 've been dying to get into FPV drones but have always balked at the high skill barrier for entry , this is as powerful a gateway drug as anything else -- it 's genuinely the most fun you can have without actually moving . <h> iPhone 14 Pro Max -- BRONZE WINNER <p> It might be a copout to give a nomination to the biggest , most expensive iPhone ever . But the iPhone 14 Pro Max truly breaks new ground for this stalwart of the smartphone world , with brave ideas for the future -- those that will define Apple 's most important product for years to come . Yes , there are a few rough edges that have perhaps held it back from taking the Gold or Silver award , but hey , that gives room for the iPhone 15 Pro to surpass our expectations , just as the iPhone 13 Pro did . <h> Tech brand of the Year <h> Samsung -- GOLD WINNER <p> Aside from making crass ads poking fun at Apple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been on a roll this year . The company has been pushing on all fronts , from jaw-dropping concepts like the Odyssey Ark to the reintroduction of the much-loved Note as the Galaxy S22 Ultra . It also extended its lead in foldables , refined its wearables and earbuds and , after years of pushing QLED TVs , finally jumped into producing OLED screens in a big way . It 's a company at the height of its powers and we 're excited to see how they top this next year . <h> Hyundai -- SILVER WINNER <p> So too is Hyundai , which may not be a tech company per se , but has also brought relentless innovation in the automotive space . Out of all the legacy carmakers , it 's arguably the one most prepared for an electrified future , with two of the most forward-thinking EVs on sale in Malaysia -- the Ioniq 5 and the EV6 from subsidiary Kia . And there 's even more exciting stuff on the horizon , if cars like the Ioniq 6 and the N Vision 74 concept are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you want about Cupertino 's exorbitant pricing strategy , baffling design choices and obnoxious fans -- 2022 is the year that Apple stepped out of its comfort zone and finally caught up with the rest of the tech world . iOS 16 is now within spitting distance with Android in terms of customisation , while the company has also jumped on the pixel-binning bandwagon with the iPhone 14 Pro series . Other things , like Stage Manager and the iPhone 14 Plus , may have been more of a miss than a hit , but props for trying something new . And let 's not forget , Apple gave everyone the best lesson on how to " turn that frown upside down " with the Dynamic Island . <h> Disappointment of the Year <h> Samsung The Freestyle -- GOLD WINNER <p> Samsung 's The Freestyle was a hugely hyped device when it debuted , as it seemed like the most flexible , portable projector you could buy . However , when we actually got to use it , it was a huge stinking pile of nope . Priced at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a projector that ultimately sucked at doing the one thing it should have been good at -- project a visible image . Furthermore , you also had to get an additional battery pack to actually use it outdoors . For a product that promised so much and looked so cool , it 's probably something the South Korean electronics giant will want to quickly sweep under the rug . <h> iPhone 14 Plus -- SILVER WINNER <p> On paper , the iPhone 14 Plus should 've been a winner . It brought a larger display and a bigger battery to the regular iPhone lineup , meaning that users no longer had to splurge for the Pro Max model if they just wanted a bigger device . However , nothing exists in a vacuum , and when compared against the iPhone 13 Pro Max , the iPhone 14 Plus suddenly looked like a much , much worse purchase . It is essentially the same phone , with the same size and processor , and yet has a worse display , a poorer camera setup and for some reason a shorter battery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for a company infamous for its ' courage ' , the iPhone 14 Plus just seemed like Apple played it way too safe . <h> Stage Manager on iPad -- BRONZE WINNER <p> Stage Manager promised a lot of things such as a cleaner windowed interface and improved multitasking . However , it seemed that Stage Manager would end up giving Apple more problems than solutions . Even before launch , it was so buggy that Apple had apparently delayed the launch of iPadOS 16 so that they had more time to fix it ; it would eventually be released as iPadOS 16.1 . <p> And yet despite the fixes , Stage Manager feels completely broken compared to the rest of the iPad experience , with windows not changing in size and not snapping correctly , the iPad resizing all of your windows at random and an overall bad user experience . It 's just a really poor feature that Apple thought would revolutionise the iPad experience when in actuality it became the blemish we could all do without . <h> Surprise of the Year <h> Dynamic Island -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we thought the iPhone 14 Pro was the world 's worst-kept secret , the redesigned Face ID cutout having been leaked well in advance . And then the reveal happened and our jaws dropped as the pill came alive , turning into a separate part of the interface . They dropped further when Apple announced the ridiculous Dynamic Island name . The shock may have died down since then -- especially after we found out how little functionality it eventually shipped with -- but the memory of the moment will live on for years to come . <h> DJI Avata -- SILVER WINNER <p> As a person more well-versed in DJI 's camera drones , the Avata came from left-field . But as a product it makes sense -- it 's an FPV drone that benefits from the company 's peerless imaging and crash detection prowess . What 's more surprising was how well all this worked in reality , as Rory found out . With its intuitive motion controls , agile handling and comfortable goggles , the Avata was a thrill to fly , even impressing an experienced FPV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> While Malaysians have been adept at buying games online -- largely thanks to huge sales held seemingly every month -- game subscription services were practically non-existent until PlayStation Plus was revamped recently . As for Microsoft , it makes a killing in other markets with the Xbox Game Pass , but it does n't have an official gaming presence here . That 's why the local launch of the PC Game Pass came as such a surprise , and the fact that it was so reasonably priced -- while offering tons of AAA titles -- only made it even more astonishing .

This was revealed by environment and water ( KASA ) minister Datuk Seri Tuan Ibrahim Tuan Man . <p> " Starting next year , all vehicle procurement by the government will consist of electric cars , " he said at a press conference following an event yesterday . <p> He also revealed plans to make certain locations such as Langkawi and Putrajaya as starting points to drive electrification forward . " For example , in Langkawi , we could give 100 electric motorcycles to residents in exchange for their old bikes or upgrade their vehicles . Our intention is to use such resort islands as a pilot project , " he said . <p> He added that the choice of utilising islands such as Langkawi to help develop a model was because implementation would be easier in terms of infrastructure and support . As for Putrajaya , he said that the government was looking at making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the usage of EVs there . <p> He added that details regarding specifics have not yet been decided . " The details have not been decided yet because there are not many EVs ( in our market ) , so the cost is quite high , but if more are used , the cost will be cheaper , " he said . <p> Tuan Ibrahim said that a current issue is the number of charging stations available in the country , which are still limited . He said that the government is currently in negotiations with several parties to develop the charging infrastructure . <p> The minister 's statement on EV adoption by the government follows that as outlined in the Low Carbon Mobility Blueprint ( LCMB ) , a study that was published by the Malaysian Green Technology And Climate Change Centre ( MGTC , formerly known as GreenTech ) last year . <p> In it , the study -- which details recommendations by KASA -- listed out the adoption of BEVs for use in government and GLC fleets as a means to encourage wider adoption , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to establish EV procurement for the government fleet by open tender , listing up to 2030 for the process . <p> The plan calls for 10% of new additions to the fleet being of battery electric vehicles ( BEV ) in the first year ( which was supposed to have been this year ) , with the percentage increasing to 20% over the following two years . The process will also be adopted for GLC fleets , with tax incentives being provided until 2030 , with 20% of new vehicles for the GLC fleets to be made up of EVs in the next three plus years . <p> Anthony Lim believes that nothing is better than a good smoke and a car with character , with good handling aspects being top of the prize heap .

So if they do faced difficulty with finding charging network as EV users in Malaysia can testify , it would spur them to legislate the buildup of more chargers at a faster rate thus it will help us a whole lot whence it is our plebs turn in switching over to EV use . <p> Before procurement begins , who is getting the billion dollar mega contract ? In terms of vehicles and charging infra , Spanco or who ? Even without taxes , most bigger EVs would be priced above quarter of a million RM each . Perodua has a pilot EV project.Why not reward P2 for their hard work instead of awarding to " unknown " s . <p> I dare to save the main purpose switching to EV not because of environmental conservation .

Some places where they need to visit might not even have basic infra like reliable water , power and internet what more a fast charger for their EV . For those who have EV right now better watch out as our VIP might want to use the fast charger ASAP and those fast charger might be ' chop ' in advanced . <p> I do n't think the government is ready on full scale EV .

Sometimes I wish I also can make money without doing anything , but unfortunately I have to work hard : ( <p> Actually , before 2016 or so , every government fleet vehicle had to be a national badged or CKD model . If state governments ( mainly , opposition states ) did not follow this rule , they had to justify their purchase ... usually a political shxtshow ensued . Just recall all those times whenever state governments bought CBU Toyota Camrys and Mercedes-Benzes . Their standard excuse was that the Perdana V6 was ' too expensive to maintain ' ( usually , because of third-party service markup/incompetence by Spanco ) , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is better and cheaper than the Perdana ) . <p> Somewhere along the line ( after 2018 ) , government fleet purchase of CBUs and non-national cars became ' normalized ' . Even though the CBU/CKD Proton X70 ( for all purpose use ) , and CKD Honda Accord ( de facto successor to Perdana 2.4 ) are perfectly fine for both federal and state government fleets , some still insist on CBU Toyotas and Continental luxury models . <p> If the government does n't want to support Proton anymore , or if it 's really necessary to buy something better than a X70 or Accord ... then at least buy something from a car company that has invested billions in local CKD assembly ? Why waste millions of taxpayer ringgit on CBU models which do n't contribute to the development of our auto industry ? <p> So yes , if this EV fleet plan is serious , and does n't get u-turned and sidetracked like basically every other government ' plan ' these days ... I personally hope the government will stock their future EV fleet with CKD models @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CKD EV industry , build up the local supply chain , and build trust ( in terms of quality , especially ) for local EV vendors . Or is this too much to ask or expect from them ? Sigh . <p> What great ministers we have .

Do n't need buy new cars to show ! For what ! Gaji buta ! Otak udang ! <p> Once EV being implemented , gradually the use of fuel oil ( Petro/diesel ) will decline . There are good &amp; bad , the good is government will gradually removed subsidy for fuel which runs on billion , bad things is Malaysia is oil produce country , it might impact in ling run ...

@@95643239 <p> Unless you 're prepared to jailbreak your iPhone , being able to only download apps via the App Store has long been a hallmark of Apple 's walled garden approach to software for its devices , in stark contrast to the much more open Android ecosystem . However , according to a new report by Bloomberg , this could all be set to change thanks to some new rules introduced by the European Union . <p> This comes as a result of the new Digital Markets Act that 's set to take effect in Europe next year , with the European Union requiring companies to fully comply with it by 2024 . Part of this new law requires all technology companies to allow users install third party apps of their choice onto their devices . This is on top of getting messaging services to work together better , allowing users to change their default settings easier , as well as giving developers equal access to features within apps and services . <p> Apple is currently working to ensure they meet this 2024 deadline , with key people such as software engineering vice president Andreas Wendker overseeing the move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle by putting in place some security requirements even for apps distributed outside of the App Store , such as verification by Apple ; they could presumably charge the user a fee for this service . <p> It 's understood that within Apple at least , not everyone is onboard with the idea still and is perhaps only going along due to having their arm twisted by the EU . Cupertino has previously spent years before this lobbying the EU on why allowing users to sideload apps onto their iPhones would be a security nightmare ; just last year , Apple released a 16-page document called ' Building a Trusted Ecosystem for Millions of Apps ' , which highlighted the ' important role ' of the App Store in protecting both users and app developers by preventing malware and piracy running rampant on iPhones . <p> There would also be other ramifications for Apple thanks to the EU 's Digital Markets Act .

Even Google Chrome would be affected ; Apple requires all mobile browsers on iOS use its WebKit engine , meaning that even Chrome on iOS uses WebKit , despite using its own Blink engine on every other platform . <p> That being said , Apple is apparently yet to decide on some issues within the Digital Markets Act still , such as whether or not to allow app developers from giving users a way to make in-app purchases and subscriptions without going through the App Store . There 's no word yet on whether they plan to open up iMessage and integrate it into RCS either , the messaging protocol championed by the likes of Google .

@@95712230 <h> Reforms to move forward together <p> The appointment of ministers and deputy ministers exposed divisions among supporters of both sides . On the one hand , the Prime Minister 's retention of the finance portfolio was criticised as an over-concentration of power ( enabling massive corruption in the past , including 1MDB ) and a violation of an earlier promise , but also understood as a way to prevent certain political factions from grabbing too much power . The choice of a Deputy Prime Minister facing 47 corruption cases was denounced as a dereliction of principle , but also accepted as a necessary feature of an unprecedented unity government : some called it an opportunity for true reconciliation and reform . <p> Others appointed to the cabinet include first-time appointees upon whom much hope is placed , alongside returnees from previous cabinets . This has led to some unexpected bedfellows : for example , the Defence and Transport ministers were at one time the Menteri Besar and Opposition leader in Negeri Sembilan respectively ! <p> Many disgruntled people have tried to argue that certain parties should have received more ministerial posts based on the strength of parties in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies and federal statutory bodies , and I hope that the sentiment from the Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs ( Ideas ) statement prevails : for everyone ' to proceed in the spirit of sacrifice and generosity in ensuring a stable unity government ' . <p> Indeed , the very survival of the government is a subject of chatter , with the vote of confidence in the Dewan Rakyat being regarded as a first important test , before a major evaluation in the form of six state elections due next year . No doubt , the newly appointed members of the executive branch will be under enormous pressure to perform : many of them will be seen to have been appointed only to appease certain quarters and so will want to prove their mettle in a short time . <p> Yet , the most important challenges facing our country require a long-term view . I am curious how powerful and impactful the National Unity Ministry will be , for in order to be effective it must be able to coordinate reforms and programmes with the ministries of Education and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arts and Culture . Only such a holistic approach can ensure consistent teaching and application of principles and values commensurate with the spirit of togetherness that was called for by the Yang di-Pertuan Besar of Negeri Sembilan after the Conference of Rulers . <p> In the meantime , the National Unity Ministry is welcome to revisit the National Unity Youth Fellowship that was previously organised by Ideas in partnership with the National Unity and Integration Department under the Prime Minister 's Department and the Malaysian Institute of Integrity in 2015 and 2016 . This programme saw dozens of Malaysians visiting communities across the country to truly understand the lives of fellow compatriots . <p> Of course , each of the ministries I mentioned has a duty to deliver according to the precepts of the Federal Constitution and Rukun Negara even without the existence of a National Unity Ministry . <p> Our schools and universities need to be places where Malaysians feel like they are growing up together with a shared future ( even in schools which are mono-ethnic it is possible , as MCKK boys and TKC girls will tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should emphasise cooperation across extra-curricular activities , while sports associations must be given the latitude and resources to nurture champions of all backgrounds . And the ' liberal approach towards our traditional heritage that is rich and diverse ' as specified in the Rukun Negara must be reflected in the government 's policy for arts and culture , including by ensuring freedom of expression . <p> Already hitting the ground running with important long-term reforms is Dato Sri Azalina Othman Said , the Minister in the Prime Minister 's Department in charge of Law and Institutional Reform ( I believe this is the first time the word ' Reform ' appears in any ministerial portfolio ) , and relevant legislation should appear soon . The proposed political financing bill ( which I 've written about before ) was scuppered by the dissolution of parliament , so perhaps that can be revived next : and the ( former and soon to be regrouped ) All Party Parliamentary Group has ready legislation on this which I hope her proposed task force will endorse .

As a result , the rules and regulations governing businesses operating in the region can be complex and difficult to navigate . One of the most common questions asked by those considering setting up a business in the EU is whether an American can own and operate an airline in the region . The answer is yes -- with the right knowledge and understanding of the regulations involved , an American citizen can set up an airline in the EU . This article will explore the various regulations that must be adhered to when setting up an airline in the European Union , including the licensing requirements , the registration process and the financial considerations that must be taken into account .

Foreign-owned airlines operating on US domestic routes would be required to form subsidiaries under Brat 's proposal . The Bush Administration proposed legislation in May 2003 that would lift the restriction on foreign ownership of U.S. airlines . In the early 1980s , the Air Transport Association of the United States supported the proposal , which was opposed by the vast majority of labor unions . Except for Southwest , all major US airlines have folded into bankruptcy or merged in the last decade .

As a result of changing foreign ownership , smaller airlines such as Alaska and JetBlue could partner with foreign airlines to combat the concentration of market power by joint venture partners . A lifting of foreign ownership caps would also have an impact on actual mergers because they would more easily be reported . When US airlines expand their ownership to 49% , a level of reciprocity will be obtained that foreign airlines would have difficulty achieving due to more lax ownership restrictions on US airlines . Delta and Aeromexico operate a transborder joint venture , with Delta owning 49% and Aeromexico owning 49% .

The European Union has established a set of rules and regulations that aim to ensure fair competition among airlines , increase safety standards , and protect passengers ' rights . Furthermore , the regulations ensure that the airline industry is financially viable , with rules governing pricing , ticketing , and airport charges . Additionally , the European Commission has taken steps to reduce the environmental impact of air transport , mandating the use of more efficient aircraft and encouraging airlines to pursue more sustainable fuel sources .

Following the passage of the Aviation Deregulation Act in 1978 , the CAB was abolished , and airline travel was permitted to compete more freely . As a result of this decision , the European Aviation Safety Agency has been in charge of establishing aviation safety and environmental protection standards . The European Aviation Safety Agency 's ( EASA ) standards cover a wide range of topics , ranging from product safety to establishing a European regulatory framework . They are in place to ensure that all aircraft and products used by airlines meet the highest safety standards .

The main regulatory agency for air travel in Europe is the European Union Aviation Safety Agency .

@@95834237 <h> Exploring The Theory Of Functionalism In European Union Politics <p> Julie <p> December 22 , 2022 <p> World News <p> The European Union ( EU ) is a complex and unique political system , and one of the most important aspects of its functioning is the theory of functionalism . Functionalism is the idea that the EU should be viewed as an evolutionary organism , where each part of the system is designed to work in conjunction with the other parts to produce a functioning whole . This idea has been around since the 1950s and has become an important part of the EU 's political system . Functionalism seeks to create a " pooling of sovereignty " among the Member States , which allows them to cooperate more effectively in areas such as trade , security , and the environment . The EU 's political system is based on the notion that by pooling sovereignty and cooperating in certain areas , the Member States can achieve a greater level of unity and progress than if they acted alone . This article will explore the concept of functionalism in European Union politics , looking at its history , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its implications for the future . <p> Different IR theories are represented by competing dyads such as realism-liberalism , **38;1163;TOOLONG ( LI ) , functionalism-federalism , and so on . Some scholars argue that there has never been a truly great debate . In this article , I will compare and contrast the competing theoretical narratives of Federalism and Functionalism . Although some may argue otherwise , the application of the theory of Federalism to European integration is not implying that the EU is a federation . The liberal-federalist approach , as opposed to the neo-realist approach , places a premium on identity-related factors when forming federations . Language , race , religion , and nationality are just a few of the factors that can prevent a desirable union from forming , according to the authors . According to Burgess , the EU has become a federation in the form of Qualified Majority Voting , direct election of European parliament , and the re-embodyment of the European Court of Justice ( ECJ ) . <p> The abolition of the intergovernmental conferences is inevitable , according to him , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . David Mitrany , the founder of functionalism , was both sceptic and hostile toward federalization of the Old Continent . The need for nations and cultures to come together to solve global problems will result in a lack of space for addressing them , according to Mitrany . He predicted that this will lead to ' the return of the narrow comforts of her own borders ' in Europe . Mirtany , on the other hand , was also skeptical about the prospect of US federalization of Europe , or as it is sometimes referred to , the United States of Europe . Neither approach addressed the interests of key stakeholders such as multinational corporations , elite members of the supranational community , and rank-and-file officials . Both schools ' models assume a major mismatch between the scale and scope of human problems and political authority . <p> There is disagreement about how to transcend those boundaries and what kind of entity should be created . A text from Mitrany is prescriptive , in part because he concerns himself with perception , convictions , and concerns himself with words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obstacles that she must overcome , and he does not have to deal with the difficulties that the statesmen do . It would be reasonable to assume that the main factor in the constitutional referendum defeat in France and the Netherlands was the term " constitution , " which is associated with federalism in the United States . Because of Mitrany 's overly bureaucratic approach , there will undoubtedly be coordination issues . The time has come to say goodbye to people like Monnet , Spaak , Adenauer , De Gaulle , Hallstein , and other top officials who played an important role in shaping the European integration process . National Parliaments have become increasingly involved in the approval of Commission proposals in practice , with the principle of subsidarity . <p> According to Mitrany , federation of inimical states will further raise tensions , thus ( directly ) jeopardizing European integration . As a result of the so-called English School theory of international relations , one could argue that India and Pakistan form an international system based on their shared history . Under Bull 's definition , an international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which means that the EU falls under this category . It is critical that a textbook describing European history is written in a spirit of unity between the countries . If even more power concentration occurs in Brussels , future constitutional defeats will be unavoidable . I concur with Mitrany 's point that a common history text must be used to replace Monnet 's vision of the world with Spinelli 's vision of it . <p> During the interwar period , the concept of functionalism emerged as a theory of international relations primarily due to a strong concern about the state 's obsolescence as a form of social organization . <p> What is functionalism ? It is a doctrine that what makes a thought , desire , pain ( or any other type of mental state ) unique is its function , or the role it plays , in the cognitive system that it is a part of . <p> In the late nineteenth century , functionalism was a philosophy that questioned the conventional structure of psychology . Psychology was founded in the nineteenth century as a science of studying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Edward Titchener , the main structuralist . <p> According to structural functionalism 's most basic definition , a political system is made up of institutions ( structures ) , such as interest groups , political parties , the executive , legislative , and judicial branches of government , as well as a bureaucratic system . <h> How Do You Explain Functionalism ? <p> Image Source : slidesharecdn <p> Functionalism is an approach to understanding the way societies and social institutions work . It looks at the various systems and functions of a society , from the family and education , to religion and the economy , to understand how they all contribute to the overall functioning of the society . It emphasizes the importance of social structures and the need for them to remain stable and orderly in order to ensure the survival of the society . It also looks at how social institutions and norms develop and change over time in order to better meet the needs of the society . Functionalism is a useful perspective for understanding the way societies work and how they can be improved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has had an important place in modern thought since its inception , is a mental state theory . The core premise of mental states is that they are determined by their actions rather than their structure . An example of this would be to compare it to artifacts such as mousetraps and keys that function by being identified by their characteristics rather than being made of materials . Despite its popularity in sociology , functionalism is frequently criticized for failing to account for social change and individual agency as well as for assigning human-like needs to society . Emile Durkheim , who is widely regarded as the father of functionalist theory in sociology , is credited with sparking this criticism . Despite the fact that functionalism provides insight into the functioning of the social world , it must not be overlooked . Analyzing both functionalism and its critics ' viewpoints is an effective way to better understand society and its members . <h> What Is An Example Of A Functionalism ? <p> Image Source : slidesharecdn <p> Functionalism is a theory of mind which holds that mental states are constituted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reductive physicalism which holds that mental states are reducible to physical states . An example of functionalism is the idea that mental states , such as pain , can be explained in terms of the functions they serve , such as signalling an injury that needs to be addressed . Functionality is at the core of functionalism , and mental states are thus seen as pieces of a larger puzzle that work together to help explain the behaviour of an individual . <p> The concept of architectural and urban functionalism emerged in the early twentieth century , and it has since become a guiding principle in modern city planning . In essence , this concept seeks to provide a city with a functional , organized , and aesthetically pleasing environment in response to the needs of its citizens . As a result , all of these elements , such as transportation , housing , and utilities , should be designed with an eye toward what users will need them for . It is not only the most effective way to create a functioning city , but it is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the study of society 's structures and how they interact , researchers can gain a better understanding of its functioning . You can use this method to generate solutions that are tailored to the needs of specific populations and uncover hidden problems . It is fair to say that architectural and urban functionalism are two very useful tools for city planners and sociologists . Creating a healthy and welcoming environment not only helps to make the environment look good but also serves as a guideline for society 's functioning . Using this process , it is possible to create solutions that are tailored to the needs of that society and thus help it achieve stability . <h> Functionalism Vs Neofunctionalism <p> Image Source : slideserve <p> Functionalism and neofunctionalism are two approaches to the study of international relations . Functionalism focuses on international institutions and organizations , while neofunctionalism places more emphasis on the role of regional integration and transnational networks . Functionalists argue that international organizations are the only way to ensure global stability and peace , while neofunctionalists contend that regional integration can create incentives for cooperation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organizations should be insulated from political influences , while neofunctionalists argue for more political involvement in order to encourage cooperation between countries . Both approaches have been influential in the study of international relations and have been used to explain different aspects of global politics . <p> The concept of neofunctionalism is that regional integration is a dynamic process in which state , organization , and individual actions have a positive impact on its entire implementation . Traditional functionalism , as it is known , sees integration as a largely state-driven process . The most important case in point for neo-functionalists is regional integration and European integration . The concept of neo-functionalism differs from functionalism in that it seeks to emphasize the positive effects of integration on the entire process . Traditional functionalism , on the other hand , viewed integration as primarily a state-driven process . Europe , according to neo-functionalists , is a major example of integration because it can have a positive effect on the entire integration process by acting in a positive way .

One of the primary goals of neo-functionalism is to investigate the underlying mechanisms that must be in place in order for a region to develop into a unified and prosperous one . Neo-functionalists seek to uncover the secrets of a successful integration project by studying the actions of states , organizations , and individuals . <h> What Is Neo Functionalism Theory <p> Image Source : springernature <p> Neo-functionalism is a sociological theory that emphasizes the role of international organizations in the maintenance of global peace and order . It is an updated version of the original functionalism theory , which was developed by Talcott Parsons in the 1950s . Neo-functionalism argues that international organizations , such as the United Nations , have the ability to unite different nations and promote common interests among them . This theory suggests that the increased interaction between nations can lead to supranational integration , which can in turn reduce the likelihood of conflict . Neo-functionalism further suggests that international organizations can help to promote economic and social development , and ensure a more equitable distribution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a key role in the maintenance of international peace and order . <p> Functionalism was founded in 1900 by Talcott Parsons ( 1902-79 ) as a response to both classical and modern sociology . It is thought to be a strategy to foster international collaboration in a variety of fields , including science , humanitarianism , social justice , and economic matters . The project was founded on the premise that by collaborating , countries can achieve a more harmonious and prosperous world . This concept promotes the creation of new and innovative solutions to global problems by emphasizing the importance of shared interests and values . The goal of functionalism is to facilitate the harmonization of cultures and the construction of bridges between countries , as demonstrated by its emphasis on collaboration . It fosters a sense of mutual respect and understanding , which can lead to improved ties between nations . Furthermore , the Functionalist approach encourages countries to develop sustainable solutions to global problems rather than impose punitive measures on them . By doing so , countries can reduce tensions and hostility , allowing for a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functionalism represents a powerful tool that can help to create a more harmonious and prosperous world . <h> Functionalist Theory <p> Functionalist theory is a sociological perspective that views society as a complex system whose parts work together to promote solidarity and stability . It sees society as a functioning organism with various interrelated parts that work together to ensure its survival . Functionalists view society as an integrated whole and analyze it from a macro-level perspective . They believe that each part of society functions to contribute to the overall stability of society as a whole . Functionalist theory focuses on the way that social structures and institutions , such as the economy , religion , and the family , help maintain order and stability in society . It also emphasizes the importance of social norms and values in maintaining order , and argues that if individuals do not conform to these norms , it can lead to social disorder . <p> The functionalist perspective , also known as functionalism , is one of the most important theoretical perspectives in sociology . Emile Durkheim was particularly interested in how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he is credited with coining the term . Some of the most well-known theorists include Herbert Spencer , Talcott Parsons , and Robert K. Merton . In other words , the process of disorganization in the system , such as deviant behavior , causes societal components to adapt . When one component of the system is malfunctioning , it affects all other components , resulting in social problems . Some sociologists have criticized functionalism for failing to recognize the negative implications of social order on a wide range of issues . <p> Family members , according to functionalists , play a critical role in society 's success and are essential to the lives of both individuals and society . The family is required in society not only for the production and reproduction of individuals , but also for the socialization of children . The family , on the whole , provides financial , emotional , and physical support to an individual , as well as guiding values , beliefs , and habits , which may assist in the resolution of common problems . Individuals find family relationships to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relationships within the family provide a safe space for them to express themselves and feel supported .

The existence of social structures , according to Durkheim , is essential to a society 's survival . Because all parts of society are linked , they must be understood in order to fully comprehend a society . The concept of functionalism refers to an interconnected system of components that work together to maintain order , stability , and social integration in society . The concept of functionalism states that all of these parts of a society are necessary for the system to function . According to this definition , we should examine all aspects of society in order to understand the whole .

Examining The Structure Of The European Union <p> Julie <p> December 22 , 2022 <p> World News <p> The European Union ( EU ) is one of the most influential entities in the world , and its structure and form of government has been the subject of much debate and discussion . One of the major topics of debate is whether the EU is a unitary government or a confederation of independent countries . While some argue that the EU is a unitary government , others contend that it is a confederation of independent countries . This article will explore the merits of both arguments and examine the various ways in which the EU is structured in order to determine if it is a unitary government or a confederation of independent countries . <p> The EU is governed by a principle of representative democracy , with citizens directly participating in European Parliament and Council of European Union decisions and those represented in the European Council and European Union Council . <p> It is a political system in which the governing power is centralized and is governed primarily by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Germany is a federal country , with the state governments and the federal government serving as the governing bodies . The central government , state governments , and German municipalities have various responsibilities , some of which are partially competed by a complex system of checks and balances . <h> Is The European Union A Government ? <p> Image Source : governstand <p> The European Union ( EU ) is not a government in the traditional sense , but rather a unique economic and political partnership between 27 European countries . The EU has its own institutions and its own currency , the euro . It also has many of the attributes of a government , such as the ability to pass laws , levy taxes , and sign international agreements . However , it does not have the same powers as a traditional government , such as the authority to raise an army or collect taxes . The EU is instead a supranational union of member states that work together to achieve common goals , such as promoting economic growth , protecting the environment , and maintaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinct political system based on representative democracy and intergovernmental cooperation . The EU project dates back to the signing of the EU treaties , and it consists of a set of values that emphasize human dignity , freedom , democracy , equality , the rule of law , and human rights . As a result of our strong commitment to democracy and human rights , the European Parliament , together with the Council of State Governments , form the legislative arm of the EU . This is one of the criteria used to qualify for EU membership . As a result , the European Union is a rare example of a democratic and human rights-focused union of nations . <h> Is The European Union A Confederation Government ? <p> Image Source : jeune-europe <p> The European Union ( EU ) , a supranational organization , has a federal and confederal structure . Despite being classified as a confederation or federation , the EU employs confederal and federal structures . <h> What Is A Confederation Government ? <p> It refers to a government formed by the independent states of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent states are in charge . The power is divided among the states , with each state 's representatives meeting to discuss the needs of their citizens . <h> A Strong Foundation Of Unity : The Articles Of Confederation <p> As a result of the Articles of Confederation , the United States is a solid foundation of unity , with the establishment of the name The United States of America , the preservation of individual state powers , and the responsibility for collective defense . Because this central government lacked the ability to tax , establish a national judiciary , and require unanimous consent for any constitutional amendments , it was not as strong as later governments , such as the Constitution of 1789 . The Articles of Confederation , on the other hand , provided the states with a solid foundation for establishing a unified nation . It may not have been the strongest form of government in the sense that it gave the central government authority to regulate the states , but it did provide states with a strong foundation to build on . It was the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual state powers , and the collective defense of the states that were the key factors in establishing a united front . The Articles of Confederation paved the way for the United States to become a single , unified country , as well as for the constitution of 1789 to create a stronger government . <h> What Is A Confederation Vs Union ? <p> As a result , confederation can be defined as a union of sovereign states with the emphasis on the autonomy of each constituent body , whereas federation can be defined as a union of states with the emphasis on the supremacy of the common government . <h> The European Union : Unique Supranational Entity <p> However , the European Union , as a supranational entity , has its own set of competences and powers over its members . As a result , the European Union does not constitute a unitary system . It is , rather , a legal and political entity with its own set of rules and regulations that all of its members must abide by . The list includes not only trade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In addition , the European Union has broad powers over member states in areas such as border control and immigration . The European Union , unlike a unitary state , employs many of the same principles and practices that unitary states do . As an example , the EU has a fiscal integration policy , which entails centrally managing and directing taxes , revenues , and expenditures , which is intended to keep the union 's economy stable and growing . Furthermore , the European Union 's member states have agreed to abide by the European Court of Justice , a judicial body that handles legal disputes among them . In general , the European Union is a supranational entity that has its own set of rules and regulations in order to promote the unity and prosperity of its member states . Many of the same principles and techniques are used to implement it as they are in a unitary state . <h> Western Europe Government <p> Western Europe is a region that is known for its democratic governments , although the exact form of government varies from country to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the United Kingdom , are parliamentary democracies , meaning that their governments consist of elected representatives who lead the country in accordance with a constitution .

Across Western Europe , citizens enjoy numerous civil liberties and protections that are enshrined in their country 's constitution . This ensures that citizens in the region enjoy a high quality of life and live in a stable political environment . <p> In the months leading up to the Brexit vote , Western Europe took a step toward political and economic integration . As a result of the integration of the EC market , a unified market with a population of 320 million is expected to emerge .

Despite its NATO membership , France is extremely important to these movements because it is not a member of NATO military machineries . Concerns about the INF remain the most pressing security concern in Europe over the last few years . NATO 's deterrence strategy , in essence , is a flexible response , one that stands in the way of the use of conventional or nuclear weapons when necessary to prevent a threat to national security .

Because of its efforts to improve the economy , the conservative-progressive cohabitation regime ( cohabitation ) enacted in March 1986 has been widely regarded . Since the latter half of 1986 , the rate of growth in the German economy that depends heavily on trade has slowed . Despite the fact that share prices and foreign exchange rates fluctuated in 1987 , Italian consumers were able to withstand the effects of this instability .

However , during the 16th century , various countries began to move towards more representative forms of government , with the Dutch Republic and England leading the way . By the 19th century , France and Germany had established constitutional monarchies , and the industrialization of Europe brought with it the growth of powerful nation-states with representative governments . In the wake of two world wars , the European Union was formed to promote peace , cooperation , and collaboration between the nations of Europe .

Bismarck enacted three social insurance laws between 1883 and 1889 . Under a Liberal administration in 1906 , Britain established a major welfare insurance scheme .
