At least that 's what the CBC is going for with its newest comedy , InSecurity , which premieres Tuesday at 8:30 p.m . <p> Starring Natalie Lisinska as special agent Alex Cranston , head of a field team for the fictitious National Intelligence and Security Agency ( NISA ) , the show follows those who serve and protect Canada 's intelligence assets to the best of their meagre abilities . The 13-episode series is Get Smart for the 24-inspired modern age of espionage . The team goes after potential uranium smugglers in the first episode and saves the Navy 's top-secret plans for a new submarine in the second . <p> The show starts off by doing something quite improbable -- making Ottawa look cosmopolitan with gorgeous aerial shots of the downtown core ( although , in a good bit of spy fakery , the series was mostly shot in Regina ) . Unfortunately things do not proceed as auspiciously from there , but there are some fun elements that can be built upon . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story open to all sorts of conflicts . Lisinska shines in the lead , walking the tightrope between being funny and somewhat believable as an operative , while Matthew MacFadzeans 's vacuous Burt is the most amusing bumbling agent of the ensemble , a guy who 's watched one spy movie too many . <p> NISA boss Peter McNeil ( William deVry ) is also good and starts off as the guy who looks like he could fit in on a serious spy drama -- until he makes his first comment about being caught looking down Alex 's shirt . " She usually does n't catch me , " he deadpans . <p> Beyond being a send-up of the intelligence community , InSecurity is equally a workplace comedy , and succeeds more often while working in that realm . <p> Unfortunately , there a problems with the tone of the series . Are these silly spies in a farcical world or funny spies in the real world ? It 's obviously a modern take on 1960s comedy Get Smart , but with that series , being over the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education coming from the gruelling worlds of the Bourne films and TV 's 24 , at times this feels a little too close to that reality , with not enough laughs packed in . <p> The jokes veer from the goofy and clich ? -- in particular a series of groan-worthy high-school reunion jokes during a torture scene -- to far too smart to have been dreamed up by these supposed knuckleheads . <p> I much preferred it when the are highbrow ; like a quip from a character admonishing racial profiling . But cringes soon followed aat a terrible joke making fun of a character 's African heritage . And deVry 's charactermight have worked better if his boss was competent and served as a foil to the clueless operatives . <p> If there is a misstep in InSecurity 's plot , it 's that heroes are always defined by their villains and this non-serialized series could use an enemy to work against . The first episode features two assailants who are about as competent as the team in question , whereas the second episode ( which a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have served as a takeoff on all the recent married couples ( Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith , Undercovers ) that are populating fictional spy-recruitment agencies .

@@3960232 Kruyt <p> Concordia University In light of the unexplained and arbitrary dismissal of Concordia University president Judith Woodsworth , we the undersigned members of the Concordia community demand a thorough and public review of the governing structures of Concordia University , with particular attention to the constitution and the powers of the Board of Governors . In light of a series of dismissals and departures from the university 's senior administrative ranks -- specifically , the firing of two university presidents in three and a half years and the resignation of five vice-presidents in six years -- the Board appears to have assumed the role of a modern-day star chamber , acting according to its own dictates , accountable and answerable to no one . It is an abuse of power . As evidence of the Board 's cavalier governing style , the press release announcing Dr. Woodsworth 's departure was released on Dec. 22 , just as the university was to close for the Christmas holidays , and sought to deceive the university community and the public by stating the president resigned " for personal reasons " when we now know her resignation was forced by the Board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members , staff and students are constantly told the university does not have .

And these decisions run the risk of rendering cynical and jaded the university 's front-line workers -- staff , students and faculty members alike -- who work in so many ways to make this institution one we can be proud of . What is particularly distressing about these dismissals and departures is that they serve to overshadow and detract from all the good things going on at Concordia University .

On Friday , the Ontario Court of Appeal denied a Leave to Appeal motion brought by a group of disabled Nortel employees regarding a Health and Welfare Trust ( HAWT ) distribution . See decision here . <p> As the ProtectOurTomorrow.com web site reported at the time , as of January 1st , these former Nortel employees are finding themselves cut off from most or all of their expected long-term disability benefits . On New Year 's Eve , disability benefits were to cease as part of a court-approved pension settlement for Nortel and its former workers . After Friday 's denial of leave of appeal , they now have 60 days to decide whether to file an application for Leave to the Supreme Court of Canada . <p> One of the financial experts working on their behalf -- Diane Urquhart -- says Nortel disability income is funded at just 27% . Many Nortel disabled do no get CPP disability income . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $9.700 per year , the combined Nortel and CPP disability income declined to 45% of what it was before Nortel 's insolvency : from $40,200 on average to just $17,900 .

Disabled with two children receive more than $47,000 a year in both the United States and the United Kingdom ( via Social Security and the UK Pension Protection Fund respectively ) . <p> The HAWT assets that were intended to fund the long term disability benefits have been used for other purposes that Urquhart says they were not legally entitled to use . Some of the funds are instead being used to pay life insurance payouts for pensioners who are still living . " Our position is that future life insurance premiums promised by Nortel were the obligation of the Nortel estate and it was not appropriate for the judge to attach that obligation to the HAWT , which is a distinct legal entity , " Urquhart told me in a telephone interview . <p> One of the Nortel employees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jackie Bodie , the Parkinson 's Disease sufferer pictured above .

@@3965234 <p> Encana Corp . is turning some of its attention back to oil in a sign of how persistently low natural gas prices are reshaping the energy industry . <p> The company , North America 's second-largest producer of natural gas , has signed a series of joint venture deals that give it a substantial interest in extracting oil from a series of lucrative new plays sweeping across Western Canada . <h> infographic <h> Energy <p> Encana split itself into two a little more a year ago , jettisoning most of its oil assets by carving out oil sands producer Cenovus Energy Inc . Although that strategy meant losing the benefits of diversification - and drew criticism from some quarters - Encana believed investors were better served with separate companies , each focused on a single commodity . <p> And it has continued its aggressive pursuit of natural gas growth . On Thursday , for instance , the company 's shares rose as much as 5.2 per cent amid market speculation that it is nearing completion of a major deal with China National Petroleum Corp . to speed development of its northeastern British Columbia gas holdings . A deal , Encana executive vice-president Mike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of magnitude bigger " than a similar $565-million agreement with Kogas Canada Ltd . <p> But Encana is also quietly shifting back toward oil as the imbalance between low gas and high oil prices dramatically tilts the business of energy extraction . Across the oil patch , companies are slashing their gas spending and attempting new ways to profit from the gas they have . Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. will drill 72 gas wells this year , down from 900 in 2005 . Talisman Energy Inc. signed a $1-billion deal late last year that will see it pursue construction of a plant in Western Canada to convert natural gas into liquid fuels . <p> " It 's not surprising that everybody is migrating from the zero-profit commodity to the extremely high-profit commodity , " said Peter Tertzakian , chief energy economist at Calgary 's ARC Financial Corp . <p> Last year , for the first time in 40 years , the United States increased its crude production . Mr. Tertzakian expects the same trend to soon surface in Canada . Within two or three years , he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our conventional non-oil-sandsoil production , too . " <p> Even with such dramatic change afoot , Encana 's new openness toward crude is striking . In recent months , it has signed joint venture deals with a number of companies to explore for oil on more than 465,000 hectares in Alberta and Saskatchewan . <p> " It does give us a lot of oil exposure , " Stacy Knull , an Encana vice-president in charge of its southern Alberta operations , said in an interview . " But we 're not scared of oil . " <p> The joint ventures are a potentially major source of new revenue . They stem from a unique part of Encana 's land holdings . The company owns more than three million hectares of " fee lands , " on which it holds subsurface rights . In those areas , which were originally granted to the Canadian Pacific Railway in the late 1800s , Encana pays no royalty to the Crown . <p> Instead , it can charge royalties to other companies - a strategy it is now pursuing on lands that lie in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including the Viking , Cardium and Alberta Bakken . Encana has agreed to allow other companies to explore some of its lands in exchange for a royalty of anywhere between 30 and 38 per cent . <p> In the biggest deal , it gave Crescent Point Energy access to a 350,000-hectare swath along the Montana border in what is known as the Alberta Bakken ; the play that has drawn immense attention in the past year , including from major companies such as Royal Dutch Shell PLC . <p> By some estimates , the Alberta Bakken contains as much oil as Saskatchewan 's Bakken play , or roughly five million barrels in place per 260-hectare section . With about 10 to 20 per cent of that recoverable , the Encana lands could contain a massive pool . Under the terms of its joint ventures , a company such as Crescent Point has access to the Encana land for a three- to five-year period , and must drill one section of land to earn an interest in it . <p> " They 'd have to do a lot of drilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we encourage it because we make good royalties , " Mr. Knull said . <p> Encana also benefits by having someone else shoulder all the risk for finding oil . If it likes what it sees , it can then make a decision to drill for oil itself - an option it is open to , Mr. Knull said . " We 're definitely interested to see where this goes . " <p> Similar deals on other lands have already proven desirable for the company . In 2009 , Mr. Knull 's unit was Encana 's most profitable , in part because of a stream of royalty dollars equivalent to about 70 million cubic feet of daily production , or 6 per cent of Encana 's Canadian total . <h> Restrictions <p> All rights reserved .

Can the creation of great music be taught ? Or film ? Can you teach an environmental researcher to innovate a cost-effective way of purifying water ? Or how about a **40;113;TOOLONG supermarket cashier ? Then why must their detractors single out writing programs with this type of disingenuous questioning ? If teach means the transmission of information into the head of another person via spoken language , Power Point , blackboard chalk , instructional video , or combination thereof , thus squirreling this information away in the hollow tree of said person 's head for later winter retrieval , then no , you ca n't teach writing , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is basically everything when you really think about it -- and yes , this includes the cashier . <p> I decided to take an MFA in creative writing because I 'd longed to be a writer for most of my adult life and had n't a clue what the hell I was doing . This desire sprung unbidden , almost geyser-like from my love of reading ; it was a force I 'd long tried to wish away , discredit , until , more out of exhaustion than anything , I admitted that I 'd screwed up most other feasible life options , and might as well give this a shot . I knew then that I could use the great sum of money that I 'd be borrowing for tuition to purchase a sizable hunk of dedicated writing time , much more than my two years at UBC , but an MFA was a way to commit , to take this writerly urge seriously , and , more than anything , a way to meet real writers . Real writers who had published real books . This was crucial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they were indeed mortal human beings , that , like me , they were winded when they climbed stairs , and that they -- also like me -- often did n't know what the hell they were talking about . I 'm glad to say I was n't disappointed . <p> So no , you ca n't be taught to write , but I was happy to find at UBC that you can spend two years sharing your work with other writers , some of whom you respect deeply , some of whom you honestly ca n't stand , all while participating in a mostly frustrating but occasionally revelatory ongoing discussion about what makes good literature good . You can be forced to consider how plots are structured , how characters are dimensionalized , and what alchemy makes a sentence a great sentence , not because you were commanded to do so , rather because these topics simply arise whenever writing is discussed . But by no means is this teaching . <p> You can also read a mountain of fledgling , half-baked work , from which you learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is usually very much alike , even when it 's your own . Any slush pile-sifter at any literary magazine knows that apart from the really crazy stories ( often , but not always , originating from prisons ) , bad writing is quite uniform . It 's uncanny , and I would n't dare venture an explanation . But when you see enough of it , you start to catch whiffs of it in your own work , and this is the part that really hurts . Over my time at UBC , a great , wrenching shift in the way I viewed my own writing took place ; I became a more accurate assessor of what it was and -- more often -- was n't doing . It was a place I probably could have got on my own , but who knows how many solitary hours and rejection emails it would have required .

Of course MFAs are not right for everyone , but the notion that a talented , motivated person who already shows promise could be derailed and ruined by a creative writing workshop is preposterous .

" We sought to build a product to try to solve " the unfair advantage . <p> The result , Thor , is a new twist on a stock-market technology called a smart order router . <p> In these days of multiple stock markets in every country , brokers such as RBC use smart order routers to blast out orders to all of the trading venues . Want to buy 10,000 shares of XYZ Co. at $10 ? The router scours the Toronto Stock Exchange , Alpha , Pure and other Canadian markets to find any shares that are on offer at that price . One common type of router , the spray router , then sends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> However , those orders do n't all get to markets at the same time . Some have longer distances to travel . Others travel down slower wires . As a result , the orders arrive in each market at a different time . The differences are only thousandths of a second , but the technology used by high-frequency traders is so fast that their computers can see orders hitting one market and jump ahead to adjust bids and offers on other markets , in order to buy or sell at a better price . <p> " As a trader , there 's a frustration around feeling like you 're being gamed , " and that led to the research that resulted in the Thor system , said Brad Katsuyama , RBC 's head of global electronic sales and trading and one of the developers . <p> The Thor system counteracts that gaming by staggering the orders it sends out to ensure they arrive at every market as close to simultaneously as possible . That gives the HFTs no chance to react . <p> The system continually monitors the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's computers to five Canadian markets , as well as 13 U.S. markets , and adjusts the timing of orders to compensate for variances . In Canada , the difference between the fastest and the slowest is as little as 10 one-thousandths of a second . Thor has been able to shrink that to as little as 350 millionths of a second , Mr. Mills said . RBC hopes the technology will allow it to gain market share in the business of trading equities . <p> Still , it 's an open question how long it can stay ahead in the technology arms race with the high-frequency traders , who focus on technology first and foremost . The whole HFT business is built around being faster and on continually improving technology , meaning Thor may not be enough to neutralize HFTs for long . <p> " It probably wo n't be long-lived , " Hillsdale 's Ms. Reynolds said . " Everybody is going to have to get to this point , where their routers are as capable as the high-frequency traders out there butthey 're going to keep developing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he recognizes that , but already RBC has managed to get the difference in arrival times at different exchanges down close to a limit that nobody , not even high-frequency traders , has found a way around . <h> Restrictions <p> All rights reserved .

Cabinet Minister and is currently a board member with Vancity Credit Union , Canada 's largest credit union . Am Johal interviewed him in Vancouver . <p> Up until the mid 60s , tenants could n't run for public office in Vancouver . How did this change come about ? <p> I was only on City Council for two years , I was a torpedo , and it was great fun . There had never been anyone on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harry Rankin so the Communists never forgave themselves . All 1,400 of them voted for me and I beat out Harry . This was back in 1964 . <p> I had been Director of Planning in Delta at the time the tunnel was built and had worked in Burnaby and on the Lower Mainland Regional Planning Board . So I had a basic planning background behind me . I was about 32 when I was elected . I beat out a former Vancouver Sun executive who was running for the NPA . He had been president of the Alma Mater Society at UBC . <p> It was unheard of for a young socialist like me from the eastside to get elected . <p> One of the issues that was a huge human rights issue was that tenants could n't run for office . <p> I gradually built up a coalition on council . One of the great assets that I had was the support of Aenas Bell-Irving -- one of the city councillors I eventually brought over to my side who was a Red Tory . Part of a grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family on Alexander Street . It was a fashionable place to live in those days , by the harbour , in the Downtown Eastside . Aeneas was charmed by me in terms of the range of things I was interested in . He was elderly and had moved from his house to an apartment as a lot of elderly people did back then . Apartment dwellers were tenants . There were no condos then . There was no legislation for condominiums . I brought up the unfairness of not allowing tenants to run for City Council , after all , he and his elderly friends had moved out of home ownership in to apartments and knew that it was wrong if they were n't allowed to run for city council . With his help , I was able to build up a coalition on council . I really loved it . I did that again and again on other issues . <p> You could vote then as a tenant , but you could n't run for public office . So once I knew I had a majority in place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winger on council was a fellow by the name of Earle Adams who led their pack - he was very capable but very right wing . He was an NPA Councillor . At Council , I gave a speech about feudalism -- this idea of tenancy as an old feudal idea and that it had no place in Canada . I espoused the UN Charter of Human Rights in the city council chambers , stuff the City Council had never heard of . It went to a vote and got a majority . They thought that Aeneas would have voted against it because he was part of the property-owning aristocracy in the city . Aeneas gave a solid vote in favour . After the vote , Earle Adams leaned over and you could hear him saying loudly , ' For Christ 's sake , the old farts gone senile . ' <p> As a result of that , the change of the ' shitty charter ' , I mean the city charter , went through and then the legislature -- they approved it and that was that . Tenants could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle of course . <p> Did it change the make-up of council ? Maybe , maybe not , but , god knows , it was the right thing to do . It was long overdue . I guess that would have been around 1965 , I guess . <p> During the Barrett Administration you were involved with the ALR and the development of Whistler . How did all that come about ? <p> It was really wide ranging . In the three years , we really changed the rules of how government worked in B.C. There was no Hansard until when we came in . There was no record of the proceedings or the debate . Question Period became more real . Fundamental parliamentary changes were brought in . <p> In Vancouver , I was a City Councillor when I got elected to the legislature . At the time , WAC Bennett wanted to make something large like the Bank of America in San Francisco on Robson Square , about 52 stories at Robson Square . We were all opposed to it on City Council . I spent my spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great architect Alvar Aalto who was so revered in Finland that he was building buildings that they did n't even know what to do with . Finlandia Hall , great universities , libraries and so on . I told myself , damnit , we need to celebrate our greatest talents too . We wanted to do something interesting in Vancouver . <p> I felt like Clark Kent going in to a phone booth . Arthur Ericson was n't really known then and I thought he was a treasure to the city . When the vote came in , I phoned Arthur up in between the two governments , in the interregnum of the two governments when the changeover was still happening . I said Arthur we are going to hire you to re-do Blocks 42 and 52 . I was n't even a Minister at the time and had no authority to authorize anything . The previous government had spent $10 million on an establishment architect and we wanted to start over . I said , ' We 're hiring you to start over again .

That was it , we started Robson Square . The next government took the credit for it and cut the ribbon of course after it was finished . <p> Same thing with Whistler , Al Raine and Nancy Green saw me in my early days as Minister of Natural Resources . They had written me a letter . They said Blackcomb had great skiing potential . I used to read all my letters back then when I was a Minister . I had a ranger visit there . So we stopped any potential logging . Prior to that , we had talked to the Parks branch . There was great pressure to host the Olympics at that time in the 70 's . I was n't really sold on it because it was too premature . Colorado had decided against hosting it . I said did you go down there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out newspaper articles . I said what 's wrong ? He banged his head . Under WAC Bennett government bureaucrats were n't allowed to phone outside the province . With a great team , we pulled in snow engineering , analyzed the snow and the weather . We came up with the plan to have Whistler and Blackcomb and eventually the town centre . It worked out exceedingly well . Eventually , Grace McCarthy cut the ribbon . <p> ALR had been on the dusty shelves of the Ministry of Agriculture under the Deputy Minister St. Peterson . He had told the Agriculture Minister , Dave Stupich , that they were in favour of it , but the truth of the matter is that a number of colleagues went out without cabinet authority in the Barrett regime . Stupich was one of them . He announced the ALR without cabinet authority . It was very messy for us internally . It became clear that the ministry had n't done the due diligence or the capacity to run with the project . The file got privately got turned over to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Richmond . He was our best lawyer for stuff like that . He spent weeks with me in the legislature , after 14 drafts we ended up giving Stupich the legislation . They had n't budgeted for compensating the farmers . The Ministry had argued that they should budget for it . I argued that that was madness . I got control of the file . If you want to look after farmers , there are other ways like crop insurance and old age pensions to do that . Whatever you like , we 're not going to pay them for the public 's right to create the ALR . <p> The ALR became a strongly established principle . It was brought in soon after . Many brave people came out on the hustings to support it . It was really like the KKK in those days in the Fraser Valley in terms of that legislation in those days but we got through it . It 's clearly one of the things that lasted the longest . In truth , most of what we did in the Barrett administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

" <p> McLeod said there are many critics who have opinions about the way the incident was handled , but they do n't actually know what happened . <p> Throughout the week , RCMP officers have repeatedly defended the decisions made before and after the shootings . <p> Vigor also spoke highly of the skills and training of the four officers at the scene , who have sometimes been portrayed as being inexperienced officers . <p> Both McLeod and Vigor said if they had walked into the Quonset they would have been killed as well . <p> Speaking to the media outside court , Vigor said he does n't believe the RCMP officers could have done anything differently that day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said similar searches go on dozens of times in Alberta every week . <p> " The only difference was , James Roszko came back with the intent to murder police officers , " he said . <p> Officers have testified throughout the week that they have never encountered a situation where the subject of a search returned to the scene to confront officers . <p> Vigor , who retired from the force in 2009 , said he is not proud that he had to shoot Roszko . <p> " But I 'm proud of the fact that I stopped him , and stopped him from taking more lives , " he said . <p> He said he hopes the inquiry will bring some closure to the victims ' families , and to himself . <p> The fatality inquiry is slated to resume on Monday with another five days of testimony .

The theory , promoted in policy circles and at all levels of government , assumes a heavy influx of business immigrants -- an umbrella term for investors , entrepreneurs and the self-employed who are admitted to Canada on the basis of the wealth they will generate ( investor-class immigrants to Canada must be willing to spend more than $800,000 in this country , and their net worth must exceed $1.6 million ; entrepreneurs must have a $300,000 net worth and two years of business experience ) . <p> Certainly Quebec 's resident population seems disinclined to take up the flag of entrepreneurial dynamism . According to one study published last year , the province 's rate of business ownership is currently half that in the country as a whole , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a business is among the lowest in the country . <p> Why the wealthy newbies have itchy feet is n't yet clear . The report compared the stated destinations of immigrants who arrived between 2000 and 2006 with the location from which they filed tax returns in 2006 , but it offered no explanations for trends in migration . Curiously , new arrivals to Quebec in other immigration categories show no such flightiness : the province 's overall retention rate of immigrants stands at 79 per cent , which is far short of Ontario 's 91 per cent , but a whole lot better than Saskatchewan 's 48 per cent , or Atlantic Canada 's 43 . <p> Brahim Boudarbat , an economics professor at the Universit ? de Montreal 's School of Industrial Relations , says the exodus may stem in part from Quebec having its own immigration program , which can offer quicker entry to Canada than the one Ottawa provides for the rest of the country . " I think some investors are using the Quebec system as a pathway to other provinces , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a person has been admitted to Canada . " They know that once accepted by either of the two programs , they can go wherever they want . " The sizable portion of investor-class immigrants coming from China and Hong Kong might also be playing a role , Boudarbat adds . " We know that many Chinese immigrants settle in British Columbia . It seems like immigrant investors are moving close to their community . " <p> Whatever the reason , the trend is cause for soul-searching in Quebec , given how heavily the province is banking on external wealth to drive its future economy . " I think the general question would be : is Quebec a friendly place to do business ? " says Jennifer Hunt , a McGill University economist who has studied the relationship between economics and immigration . " Answering that may have a broader economic payoff , " she adds , by stimulating non-immigrant commercial enterprises . It would also come at a cost -- in business-friendly tax cuts , say , or less red tape for start-ups .

Lots of non-white immigrants will soon be avoiding Toronto for BC , and little mosques on the Prairie might not be such a rare thing in the future . Quebec will endure , just like it has since The Conquest of 1759 . The article fails to mention the 40 per cent of immigrants who stay in Quebec . <p> As an English speaking Quebec resident I can assure you that language is a problem . The goal to " stamp-out " English is alive and well in Quebec . The other problem is taxes , and plenty of them . Aproximately double that of Ontario <p> Logic suggests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Province . Only B.C , Alberta and Ontario send more Ottawa they they get back . The remaining seven " have not " Provinces rely on the largess of Ottawa to try to meet their budgets . Language may be part of the issue but being a " have not " Province is an important negative criteria for business minded people . <p> Actually there are only two so-called " have " provinces now . Ontario has become a net receiver . The entirety of Quebec 's draw on the national treasury and a good chunk of the Maritime provinces ' is funded by the taxpayers of Alberta . <p> To be fair , the doom and gloom is n't really backed up in this article . We hear about 49 thousand total immigrants to Quebec , but the vast , vast , majority are from other classes . We are n't given a number in regards to how many business immigrants are arriving to Quebec in the first place . <p> Moreover , investor class business immigrants are , er , investing . So presumably it does n't really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their dollars are mobile across the country as they seek out opportunities . My scant investing dollars sure do n't huddle in my home province . <p> And , finally , the entrepreneur class is notoriously suspect as a class . 300k gets you a Macs Milk franchise these days , and convenience/food service franchises are known as entrepreneur class standbys ( if only for bureaucratic reasons -- try convincing a federal bureaucrat that you are talented enough to create a successful tech startup . It 's easier to tell them , and to prove to them , that you 're opening a new Subway sandwich outlet or Tim Hortons ) . <p> Now , I 'm not mocking these folks . Far from it , as I think they 're hard working , or at least hard investing , people that Canada can use . But all we have is a marginally higher rate of migration of a small number of people , who are themselves making a positive but small contribution to the Canadian economy , and the Quebecois economy in particular ( but not exclusively ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fact that the Quebecois system might be picking out candidates that originally wanted to go elsewhere , and that really should n't be characterized as " Quebecois " immigrants in any real sense , anyways . <p> Yeah , sounds like Quebec 's really screwed for sure . I 'd be waiting up nights if I was them . <p> Stamp out english speakers and stamp out the hard working cash earners . Forcing their kids into french schools stamp out and scare away the future hard working cash earners . Is anyone surprised at this coming from a province with it 's head in the sand ? " I Remember " on their license plates ? Pppfffttt ! <p> I find it ironic that Quebec wants to ban Islamic headwear like the hijab and the niqab when so many immigrants who speak French come from Arab countries like Morocco and Algeria . Instead , maybe Quebec should consider instituting sharia , in the hope of drawing francophone immigrants from Muslim members of the French Community . <p> " Six out of 10 business-class immigrants who land in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to resolve this issue might be for Immigration-Qu ? bec to only accept as immigrants French unilingual entrepreneurs .

Is this really a surprise ? Oh well , the demogrpahic winter heading our way will resolve a bunch of these issues . <p> The article fails to mention one main reason those business immigrants move to another province is because of 101 . Language law 101 prevents immigrant parents from sending their children to English schools , but many of the parents want their children to be English speaking North Americans , not French speaking Quebecers . <p> All Canadians , not just Quebeckers , should be proficient in both languages .

No more of this two solitudes and all that jazz . <p> Look at what happens when you do n't speak English . There was a story not too long ago about how teachers at CEGEPs in Quebec were baffled that students did n't want to continue their studies in French .

We are both professionals and we loved Montreal , had great jobs and paid our share of taxes . But we could never live in a province that will force our children to attend French schools . Why should they have to learn French when it is useless in the real world outside of Quebec and France ?

" <p> According to church abuse activist Lieve Halsberghe , Father Dejaeger came to the attention of Belgian police in 2000 after a complaint was filed by a parishioner . For four years , former Belgian magistrate Godelieve Halsberghe , Lieve Halsberghe 's aunt , " pleaded with Erik and his church superiors to return to Canada and provide justice to his Inuit victims .

" <p> Even then , however , said Lieve Halsberghe , " nobody moved . " <p> Later , Lieve Halsberghe tracked down Sergeant Tom Power , the RCMP officer who conducted the investigation in Igloolik in 1995 . Now posted to St John 's , Sgt.

" But how much beer are you actually getting when that " pint " lands on your table ? <p> The answer seems pretty obvious -- but do n't be so sure . <p> The thing is , there are no rules governing how much beer must go into that " pint " you 've ordered -- meaning you could be getting anywhere from 473 ml to 568 ml of beer , and the bar owner can call it a pint . <p> Why , you ask ? <p> Well , the federal government regulates the definition of measurements , through the Weights and Measures Act ( clever name , that ) -- and a " pint " is defined as the Imperial Pint , which is 568 ml ( 20 oz ) . So far , so good -- but the SLGA does n't regulate the size of glassware used in licensed establishments , they do n't enforce how the word " pint " is used and they do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The problem is that there 's no industry-accepted standard for beer glassware , and much of it is produced in the U.S. What this means is that many pint glasses are made to hold a U.S. pint , which is 473 ml ( 16 oz ) of beer -- or 20 per cent less than an Imperial pint . Complicating matters further , if the glass is from a German or Czech brewery , it will likely hold 500 ml ( 17 oz ) , the EU measurement . What this means is that even an honest and entirely above-board pub owner could legitimately sell their beer in three different serving sizes -- and unless you 're a glassware expert , you 're none the wiser . <p> That 's bad enough -- but things get even worse when you realize that not every bar owner is fully honest . There are establishments in town -- just like in every town , to be fair -- that use glassware that is , to be blunt , entirely misleading . This can mean the kind of glass that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid base or is shaped to look like it carries more beer than it does . These glasses can carry as little as 414 ml , and still carry the moniker " pint . " <p> In fact , the problem goes beyond the pint : draught beer is served in glasses , schooners , ubersteins , mugs , sleeves and whatever other creative names the owner can come up with -- and none have any standardization , meaning they can be whatever volume the owner wishes . Sigh . <p> You might not think that a few millilitres here or there make much of a difference , but consider that prices do n't really deviate to reflect the varying volumes -- meaning you 'll be paying roughly the same amount for a pint , even if the bar you 're in is serving you 20 per cent less beer than their competitor . <p> Sadly , there 's really no way for a customer to find out how big the beer servings are -- pub owners are n't required by the SLGA to post their sizes , meaning they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pint and no one is the wiser . Hell , they could give you a glass that looks like a pint but has barely over 400 ml of beer in it , and you still probably would n't be the wiser -- although someone would definitely be richer . <p> Clearly , the better pub owners in town are both exceedingly good at serving you the pint you asked for and pretty open about their tap servings -- and in fact , a number of places have their serving sizes on their menus . Good on them for respecting their customers -- but the point is that not everyone does . <p> So , what can you do to make sure you 're getting an actual pint when you order one ? First , ask questions . If you 're not sure about the size of glass you 've just been served , ask your server how many millilitres their pint glasses hold -- and if they do n't know , keep pressing , because someone who works there knows . As well , know your beer prices : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? If a 568 ml pint sells for $6.00 down the street and someone wants to sell you a 473 ml pint of the same beer for $5.75 , you 're clearly not getting a deal . Be a smart consumer . <p> Consumer protection regulation is also something I 'd really like to see . Next door in Alberta , they require pubs to inform their clients of their serving sizes -- it 's rather limp protection in practice , but certainly better than nothing . In England , they strictly define beer serving volumes , and every pub owner must serve those sizes ( for the record : pint , schooner , half pint and 1/3 pint ) . Lastly , the EU requires that every glass must have a clear volume marker on it , showing you where 330 ml or 500 ml is . I personally like that one the best , as it forces transparency ( and also deals with the issue of too much head , which is another article unto itself ) . <p> For those of us that love the stuff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so why not make sure that 's exactly what you 're getting ? <p> Web exclusive : read Jason Foster 's take on the beer highlights -- and lowlights -- of 2010 at www.planetsmag.com.

That wait could take decades in some cases - raising questions over how well the investment will perform - although AIMCo believes it will take on average five or 10 years . <p> The firm says it is happy to be patient , especially since it bought the forests out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Very few people can sustain the drain in cash flow for the short term to realize a very good return in the long run , " said AIMCo chief executive officer Leo de Bever in an interview Thursday . " Us being long-term investors makes that possible . " <p> Part of the attraction is that the firm owns the land outright , giving it the freedom to choose whether to make the rural land into forest , farm land or even houses , depending on which shows the best expected returns . <p> Some of those decisions will be driven by demand in China and India , which have a growing hunger for both wood products and food . And AIMCo , which has grown from 180 people to 270 in the past 18 months , is now staffed with substantial forest expertise . <p> " They 're not novices to the area . They 've spent a lot of time studying it , " said Paul Quinn , an analyst with RBC Dominion Securities Inc. , who maintains a database of global timber sales . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , compares with other international timber deals at around $2,500 ( U.S. ) per hectare . But those transactions have included tree ownership , making it " very hard to determine whether AIMCo got a good deal , " Mr. Quinn said . <p> There will be " no cash flows for 10 to 15 years and likely some ongoing costs to maintain the lands , " he said . And , he added , recent years have seen Australian companies " bid up the lands well past sustainable levels , so a 40 per cent discount may not be enough . " <p> Mr. de Bever , however , argued that the deal carries roughly the risk profile of a pension-style investment , " but the expected return is more attractive . " <p> AIMCo has entered into several high-profile investments since Mr. de Bever joined in 2008 . They include deals with Chinook Energy Inc. , Precision Drilling Corp. , Viterra Inc. and , its latest move , an $850-million December purchase of a 50 per cent interest in a Chilean highway . <p> The forest deal draws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to plant more trees in order to address a shortage of wood and related products . The decision granted investors a tax deduction for pouring money into so-called " managed investment schemes " - and it worked . Nearly one million hectares in new plantations were seeded ; in one year alone , investors poured $1.2-billion ( Australian ) into such projects . <p> " The term scheme in Australia does n't have the negative connotations it does here , although in this case it probably should , " Mr. de Bever said . <p> That 's because the schemes often relied on land purchased with highly-levered money , and the 2008 crash brought many of them into receivership , which has allowed consolidation of disparate ownership interests . <p> For AIMCo , that has allowed the purchase of a huge land base - 650 individual properties spread out across six different Australian states - but also enough of a discount that it believes it can weather the vicissitudes of land values , which have already experienced a substantial recovery . <p> " It 's a distressed asset . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we 're quite aware land prices go up , they may go down , " Mr. de Bever said .

We 'll strive to do better at that -- and this story , which we believe is important , is our first effort to do so . <p> Most of the 70 or so people attending the Jan. 14 event at the Regina Indian M ? t is Christian Fellowship 's Dewdney Avenue kitchen are the kind of people used to being thankful for small mercies , such as chili and bannock for lunch . They were joined by representatives from the Saskatchewan 's union movement . <p> The event ? A press conference and rally drawing attention to the impending closure of the Welfare Rights Centre . <p> Operating since 1973 as an advocacy and support group for Regina 's welfare recipients , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Last November the provincial government announced it would end its contract with the organization , citing questionable operations . <p> The staff and clients are n't happy . <p> If you take this at face value , the closure of the Welfare Rights Centre is a direct consequence of poor financial record keeping and reporting , discovered during a review by the provincial government , which sealed the fate of the centre . <p> Critics might suggest the move is another example of the Saskatchewan Party 's tone-deaf ear for poverty issues ( see also Station 20 West here in Saskatoon , and last year 's minimum wage freeze across the province ) . <p> It 's definitely a no cost-saving measure -- the $390,000 provided by the province for the Welfare Rights Centre operations is barely a drop in the province 's social assistance budget , let alone the Saskatchewan government 's overall budget . And the Centre 's work -- including acting in trusteeship for hundreds of social assistance recipients -- must be factored into any cost-benefit analysis . <p> Is there another reason the Welfare Rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a serious question , " says Morris Eagles , who was the Centre 's executive director until his 2009 retirement . " Because they the current WRC board did n't step up to the plate and say , ' We want to keep this organization going , ' is this an admission of defeat ? Or guilt on their part ? <p> " From the time the new management and new board were installed in the summer of 2009 to the time the provincial government announced that it was pulling funding , the Welfare Rights Centre had ample opportunities to correct whatever problems the province had illustrated , or rally support from the community , " says Eagles . " And I do n't know why they have done neither . " <p> Norm Pottruff , who helped found the WRC in the mid-1970s , is similarly appalled . <p> " Welfare rights advocacy is n't always going to battle against social workers , " says Pottruff . " It often involves working with the client and social workers to navigate a real complex and oftentimes confusing system . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently we were doing a good job . <p> " You do n't get provincial funding for more than 35 years without demonstrating a real need for your work and a real competency by those doing the work in your name , " Pottruff says . <p> So what happened ? <p> Canadian Union of Public Employee representatives and former staff interviewed by Planet S charge that the Welfare Rights Centre 's operational crisis stems from poor management/labour relations exacerbated by a drive to unionize the workplace . The union is on the record with this claim : in a Dec. 3 letter in the Leader-Post , CUPE 's Guy Marsden wrote , " It is painfully obvious that the reaction of the Centre management to the unionization of its workforce negatively impacted the level of service delivery and ultimately led to the crisis the centre is facing today . " <p> Leah Bage , the WRC 's former office manager , says the troubles began soon after the appointment of new executive director Marg Friesen and several new board members after Eagles ' retirement in 2009 . Her criticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like ' I can let go people without cause , there 's nothing written in the policy , ' and little threats , all the time , " Bage says . <p> Bage says staff investigated unionization to protect their jobs against what they saw as increasingly eccentric management . They subsequently unionized with CUPE . <p> " And when we told management about the union drive , " Bage says , " that was when everything really went downhill . " <p> Friesen disputes that account . " Ms. Bage was relieved of her duties for reasons other than union activity , " she says , adding that her comments on the Centre 's policies should be viewed as open communication with employees , not threats . <p> " The policies are a blueprint for operations of Welfare Rights Centre , " says Friesen . " The policies of the Welfare Rights Centre have been updated to encourage a respectful workplace , and also to inform employees of the way the organization does business in general and more specifically , roles and responsibilities . " <p> " Welfare Rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negotiate what is in the best interest for all parties , " she adds . <p> Last August , Bage and one other WRC employee were fired . The stated reason was that the WRC could n't find an insurance company to bond them , as they had criminal convictions long before they were hired . But neither the pair 's work performance nor the ability to post bonds had been an issue when Eagles was the executive director , both say . <p> The two and CUPE have appealed their dismissal to the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board , who heard the case Nov. 4 . The SLRB has yet to issue a judgment . <p> When the provincial government announced it was pulling the plug on funding the WRC last November , Friesen issued a press release that staff call a ' letter of surrender ' . If the province was cutting funding , the centre would close Feb. 25 . End of story . <p> It 's a stance that 's flabbergasted Pottruff . <p> The WRC provides a trustee service for about 250 welfare recipients -- those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone incapable of handling financial affairs . Under trusteeship , the WRC receives the recipient 's social assistant cheques and pays the bills -- rent , utilities -- and budgets the money for the recipient 's needs , such as groceries and bus fare . <p> But with the end of the WRC , who 's going to do that work ? <p> If you 're a collection agent with SaskPower or SaskTel , or a landlord , axing the WRC means your job is about to get that much more difficult . <p> " Through blood , sweat and tears , we built that organization up and we were considered to be a very credible organization in Regina , " says Eagles . " Within a year and a half of my leaving , that organization , for whatever reason , has been completely dismantled and destroyed .

@@3985235 <p> BHP Billiton Ltd. has itself to blame for Ottawa 's decision to reject its hostile takeover offer for Potash Corp . of Saskatchewan Inc. , says the head of the fertilizer giant who fought hard to fend off the $39-billion bid . <p> In one of his first media interviews since Ottawa denied the takeover almost three months ago , Potash Corp . chief executive officer Bill Doyle said the Australian mining giant " got in their own way " when they launched the bid to buy one of Canada 's resource champions . <p> " Had they come with just a little bit of humility they might have had a different outcome , " Mr. Doyle said in an interview with The Globe and Mail on Thursday . <p> One of the major missteps , according to Mr. Doyle , included talk about breaking up the Canpotex potash marketing arm that provides revenues to the province of Saskatchewan . That discussion was the catalyst for the province 's concern over the BHP bid , and helped form its decision to recommend Ottawa turn it down . Officially , Ottawa ruled the takeover would not be a net benefit to the country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the province of Saskatchewan , the tax needs of the province ...

" <p> BHP declined to comment when contacted on Thursday . <p> BHP pulled its $130 per share offer for Potash Corp . days after Ottawa turned it down in early November . Since then , Potash Corp . shares have risen about 35 per cent as a result of rising demand for fertilizer to boost crop production as farmers try to cash in on rising prices . <p> Mr. Doyle called the lift in the stock " a real vindication for our fight .

Also , no other offers came forward . Still , Mr. Doyle insists to this day that potential bids were brewing during the takeover fight , they just were n't ready to make it official until Ottawa ruled on BHP 's offer . <p> " No one believed it , but we had other people that were in the wings waiting to see if they got a yes , " Mr. Doyle said .

But it is in no way non-partisan . Rather , it advances an agenda to which the Stephen Harper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the book 's contributors , Bruce Katz of Palestinian and Jewish Unity , asks why there are no parliamentarians of Arab descent or of Muslim faith sitting on this commission . <p> " The list of names of those members of Parliament , " he states , " includes a good number of people who are associated with pro-Israel lobby and who have issued statements in the past which might lead one to believe that they harbour anti-Arab and anti-Muslim sentiments . " <p> Keefer , a professor at the University of Guelph , Ontario , presents a well-documented , footnoted study , with ample arguments and evidence to counter the CPCCA 's effort " to curtail freedom of speech and academic freedom across Canada , and to stigmatize , even to criminalize , certain kinds of human rights discourse . " <p> The CPCCA 's founding premise , Keefer explains , is that anti-Semitism is " mutating into dangerous and unprecedented ' new anti-Semitism , ' " consisting of excessive criticism of Israel 's government . <p> Jason Kenney , Harper 's minister of citizenship and chief spokesman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more dangerous than the old European anti-Semitism " that fueled Hitler 's Holocaust . <p> The CPCCA 's function is to rally support for this policy , which could potentially shut down democratic debate and criminalize , under section 319 of the Canadian Criminal Code and section 13(1) of the Canadian Human Rights act , or else " silenced by judicial warrants of seizure issued under section 320 of the Criminal Code , " Keefer states . The CPCCA has concluded hearings ; its report is now pending . <p> Israel -- a state with no borders <p> Many contributions to Anti-Semitism Real and Imagined take up the CPCCA 's contention that those who do not " recognize " Israel 's existence are implicitly denying Jews ' right to a " state of their own , " which the Coalition claims is an inherently anti-Semitic viewpoint . <p> This view is a " conflation of ethnic/religious racism with opposition to a state , " explains Toronto-based activist Karin Brothers . " Since the state of Israel has never defined its boundaries , what exactly is to be ' recognized ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ' recognize ' a state which then defines its borders as encompassing territory internationally recognized as Palestinian ? " <p> Lynda Lemberg , co-founder of Educators for Peace and Justice , adds that " the equation of criticism of Israel with anti-Semitism provides a facade for Israel 's allies such as Canada who are simply interested in securing their political , military and economic interests in a Middle Eastern nation that is their chief broker in that region . " <p> In addition , Lemberg states , " allegations of the ' new anti-Semitism ' distract us from addressing the humanitarian catastrophe in the occupied territories as well as the increasing discrimination to which Palestinians living inside Israel are subjected . " <p> The complaints about a " new anti-Semitism " thus serve as a smokescreen to defend Zionism , the ideology of building an exclusively Jewish state on Palestinian land . <p> As Jason Kunin comments , it is no surprise " that for Zionists , the key to shoring up Israel 's image-tarnished in recent years by its murderous bombing of civilians in Lebanon and Gaza--is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a member of Educators for Peace and Justice and of Independent Jewish Voices . <p> For Katz , the CPCCA 's approach " is subversive of the very essence of Judaism . " The Israeli state " can not itself be Judaism , and no amount of sophistry will make it so . The worship of the State as a religious object is quite simply idolatry . " <p> I would add that far from identifying with the Netanyahu government , with its agenda of ongoing settlement-building on Palestinian land , we as Jews are logically drawn to sympathy with the victimized Palestinians , oppressed and despised , with no land to call their own , as was the case with our Jewish forbears less than a century ago in much of Europe . Jews feel the Palestinians ' pain with greater urgency because the crimes against them are done in our name . <p> These testimonies are buttressed by Keefer 's documentation that contrary to CPCCA 's pronouncements , acts of anti-Semitism have not been on the rise either in Canada , nor is there strong evidence that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Vancouver-based member of Jews for a Just Peace , explains , " Certainly most Jews in Canada can tell you of vile slurs , stereotypes , or biased comments that they have received or heard .

" She asks of the CPCCA , " What then , is the ' problem of anti-Semitism ' that your committee is asking governments to address ? " <p> Racism against Muslim Canadians <p> An outstanding submission by the Canadian Arab Federation stands stark contrast to exaggerated fears of anti-Jewish prejudice . <p> Noting that Arabs are historically counted among the Semitic peoples , he reports that " there is an increased incidence of racism and hate crimes directed at Arab Canadians and Muslim Canadians , and there are not enough institutionalized measures to effectively combat and prevent the spread of this anti-Semitism .

To convince the Jewish people to immigrate to Israel , in 1954 " Israeli politicians launched a secret campaign ( Operation ' the Lavon Affair ' ) of violence against Jewish businesses and blamed Egyptians for it . " <p> Indeed , as several contributors note , the Israeli government 's wars and oppressive policies are a major source of anti-Jewish feeling . Katz puts this well : " to claim that the State of Israel is the embodiment of all the world 's Jews is not only a lie , but a dangerous one , " it falsely inflicts on all Jews responsibility for this state 's actions . If the Israeli state embodies world Jewry , " then all Jews are made to share a collective guilt .

" Not in a negative aspect or because he was old ( 36 ) , but he was always like a father figure , which was really weird . To the guys , he was that composed and that mature that you did n't want to anger him or anything because you did n't want him to be disappointed in you .

" ( But ) I 've been very fortunate , and I do n't know if it 's all luck or just in the right place at the right time . " <p> How about a laser shot that would make Al MacInnis , Zdeno Chara or Chris Pronger proud ? It also makes Williams a threat from almost anywhere , especially on a one-timer from the point or the lower circle on the power play . But in the All-Star Classic , Williams demonstrated more accuracy than power . He was the only player to hit all four targets in the corners of the net in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his skills competition debut . Then in the All-Star Game the next night , Williams scored on his only shot , a rising wrister from the lower left circle just under the crossbar as the Eastern Conference rallied for an 11-8 victory over the Western Conference . <p> " His biggest asset is his shot and scoring touch , and he obviously has brought that to us , " Whale coach Ken Gernander said . " He 's one of the league leaders in scoring goals , which will always make for an interesting type of player to watch in an All-Star type of environment . " <p> With as many as eight Whale players on recent call-ups to the Rangers , Williams also added some penalty killing to his repertoire . But he 's best known for his shot and has tried to help some of the Whale 's younger players , notably rookie Kelsey Tessier , about shooting the puck quickly . <p> And accuracy is nothing new for Williams , who credited the trait to his early days playing hockey on a family farm in Glenavon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour outside Regina . Williams ' father , Kevin , made ice for Jeremy and his younger brother , Tristan , every winter , but it was n't exactly like Madison Square Garden . <p> " If you missed the net , there were no boards , so you 'd better be hitting the net or we 'd be searching for pucks in the snow , " Williams said with a wide smile . " My father would go out with the hose and spray it down for me and my younger brother . And if he did n't have time to build a rink , he would clean off an area of farm water so it would freeze over . He would wait until he could drive on it with the tractor , push all the snow off and then spray it down with a little water .

His 15-year-old sister , Hailee , recently won the Canadian junior women 's championship in barrel racing , which came long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing because Williams quickly became a scoring machine with Swift Current in the Western Hockey League , capped by career highs of 52 goals and 101 points in 68 games in his final season ( 2003-04 ) with the Broncos . The Maple Leafs ' seventh-round pick in the 2003 NHL entry draft then played his first full pro season with St. John 's , getting 16 goals and 20 assists in 75 games . Williams spent the next four seasons playing mostly with the Marlies but also getting a shot with one of the NHL 's Original Six teams . <p> But Williams and center Kris Newbury , on recall from the Whale to the Rangers for the second time , then signed with the Detroit Red Wings last season . Even before the Griffins failed to make the playoffs , the Red Wings decided to start shedding veteran players , including trading Newbury to the Rangers for wing Jordan Owens on Mar. 3 . <p> When the Red Wings did n't re-sign Williams , he and his agent , Craig Oster , began looking for employment and decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salary of $250,000 on July 12 . <p> " We just felt like it was a good fit , " said Williams , who turned 28 on Jan. 26 . " I was n't sure where I was headed this year after sitting around free agency for a bit , and my agent and I knew what we wanted in a contract , and opportunity-wise , where I wanted to be . He thought the Rangers might need secondary scoring and I might get a chance to help out . I had a few offers from other teams , but it 's one thing to get a contract to play in the AHL , but I was looking for a place to play in the NHL . " <p> Williams has had what he calls his most consistent season as he continues to try to improve on the defensive end , which has kept him from more time in the NHL . <p> " Aside from my first season , I 've had injury problems , and it 's kind of hard to be consistent and score goals if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staying healthy and being able to play the last few years has helped a lot . Being good defensively never came naturally for me . I play puck possession , so I 'm more dangerous in the offensive zone . I figure if you 're in the offensive zone all the time , then you do n't have to play defense . <p> " But the last seasons , especially last year after leaving Toronto , I was trying to work on my defensive play in Grand Rapids , and I think that helped me out a lot . And coming ( to Hartford ) , the same thing . " <p> Gernander said Williams was quite deserving of the All-Star honor . <p> " He was a legitimate candidate , " Gernander said . " He has been a big part of our success and has lots of positives going for him . I thought we had a couple of guys who would make real good candidates , and they chose Jeremy . Congratulations .

" There are always areas of improvement , especially if you 're at the American League level and there 's something that the NHL teams would like to see you improve upon . I think he has worked hard and brought us success helping out offensively and been a pretty good part of our team . <p> " He 's obviously a capable goal-scorer , so he 's going to have to bring a little bit more to catch the eye of an NHL squad that says this special talent that he has not only translates to the NHL level , but he can also bring ( something else ) to the game . I do n't want to say he 's a specialist , but he has a shot that kind of separates him from a lot of players in that he 's a very effective shooter . That 's how he scores a lot of his goals with the one-timer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snap shot with his good release . He 's maximizing one of his strengths or key components . " <p> Williams ' NHL-type shot is a major reason he is again being used on the point on the power play , which is handled mainly by assistant coach J.J. Daigneault . <p> " J.J. had gone to the library and watched some of Williams ' previous games and seen that he had a big shot that he can bring and discusses it with him , " Gernander said . " He figured it might be a good spot where he might fit on our power play , and it has worked out well . He does have a really good release and is a good goal-scorer . " <p> Williams ' 20th goal this season was a beauty , a strong finish of his own rebound after a brilliant rush and pass by 20-year-old defenseman Michael Del Zotto with 37.2 seconds left in overtime that gave the Whale a 3-2 victory over the Norfolk Admirals . <p> Williams said his game and how he acts in the locker room never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on recall to the Rangers . <p> " I 've always thought that everybody can talk , " Williams said , " but it 's more what you do on the ice is what the young guys and other guys on the ice are going to follow . I 'm not saying I 'm a great leader , but I try and help as much as I can . I try to talk to someone if I feel I can give advice . You can take it and listen to it and believe it , or you can take it and forget it . What you do with advice is up to you and whether or not you believe in it . " <p> Williams was named to the Eastern Conference team by a panel of AHL coaches . His 22 goals are tied for fifth in the league with former Wolf Pack wing Nigel Dawes . The Pirates ' Mark Mancari has vaulted to the goal-scoring lead with 27 . <p> " I really was n't sure if I 'd make the team , " said Williams , named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a group of Western Hockey League players against a touring top Russian junior team when he was with Swift Current in 2001 . " But it 's nice and obviously an honor and a privilege to be named , especially on a team like ours with so many skilled , veteran forwards and some new , up-and-coming young guys . It must have been hard to choose one guy off our team just based on the amount of skill level we have . <p> " I 'm fairly happy with the way things have started , " he said . " I 'm pretty tough on myself . To me , I think I should have 35 goals already just based on the number of chances that I 've had . For me , it 's just being reliable and making the right plays . Everybody is going to make mistakes -- I make mistakes -- but it 's limiting them and using brains over anything . " <p> Williams said he has benefited from playing with center Tim Kennedy , who has a pass-first , shoot-second philosophy that fits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different styles , " Williams said . " I score goals just going up and down the ice , and Tim is a very skilled , shifty kind of guy . But the last few games , I feel we 've really started clicking and understanding each other as players , so playing with him is really good , too . " <p> The Whale has been a bit topsy-turvy in Williams ' first season in Hartford , first because of so many new , young players , especially on defense , and more recently due to all the call-ups to the Rangers . That was epitomized by a team record-tying , nine-game losing streak ( 0-7-0-2 ) that started a 1-9-2-1 run from Oct. 20 to Nov. 17 and dropped the then Wolf Pack into the Atlantic Division cellar . That was immediately followed by a 12-1-0-2 surge that included winning streaks of six and four games and vaulted the Whale into second place . The Whale ( 22-18-2-5 ) are now in fourth place with 51 points , 13 points behind leader Manchester and one back of Worcester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skid , " Williams said , " but I guess you 'd rather have a nine-game losing streak at the start of the season rather than at the end , so that 's a positive that we learned from that . When a team is winning , everybody is just more confident and making better plays . Confidence is a huge part of winning and losing , and as long as you can not get too high or get too low , it 's pretty good . " <p> Williams has certainly been pretty good in his first 47 games with the Wolf Pack/Whale and deserving of the All-Star recognition .

By now the whole community , including householders on Elva Avenue and Ridge Avenue , all of whom use the property , had mobilized . Some sent letters to the Base Commander , Col.

The local Northern Ontario Junior ' A ' Hockey League squad emerged from a horrific first month of 2011 to throttle the Manitoulin Islanders twice last week by a combined score of 19-2 . <p> After losing twice to the hapless Islanders in January , the Beavers gained revenge in a big way last week .

For the game , the Beavers out-shot the Islanders 48-23 , including a lopsided 17-5 margin in the third period when the Islanders seemed more interested in arguing with referee Derek Gratton than in playing the game . <p> The pair of wins leaves Blind River in third place in the western division of the NOJHL with a record of 22 wins , 17 regulation-time losses and four overtime losses for a total of 48 points .

You 're planning to attend a meeting in Houston or you have a business transaction to close in San Diego . Or maybe your family is tagging along for a side trip to Disneyland after your convention in L.A. <p> Let 's say a U.S. Immigration officer puts your information into his computer , your name comes up , and he raises his eyebrows because he 's discovered you were involved in a " criminal matter " in 1981 -- 10 years before you got your MBA , at a time when you were n't a successful senior executive at a mid-sized Canadian financial services company . <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference plans may be wrecked , your transaction could be in jeopardy , and your side trip to Disneyland cancelled ( to the horror of your children ) .

" If that happens , the first thing you should do is to remember late author Douglas Adams ' famous advice : Do n't Panic . <p> Honest and forthright individuals can get extremely nervous in these situations , making them appear slippery and dishonest to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers . It 's tempting to ramble on about irrelevant facts that make an officer suspicious and the misunderstanding results in refusal of admission . <p> Others might lose their cool and display a bad attitude , with predictably uncool results . None of these reactions are helpful . So if you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , think long and hard before answering . And remain calm . <p> Saba Naqvi is a Vancouver immigration lawyer licensed to practice in both British Columbia and California , and she not only does business immigration on both sides of the border , she regularly assists Canadian businesses and individuals with criminal admissibility issues such as the hypothetical one described above . <p> " Do n't try to outsmart the officer as that strategy will go terribly wrong , " she says . " Fully disclose all arrests and convictions in your lifetime including the ' minor indiscretion ' that might have happened 25 years ago when you were a university student and convicted for possession of a tiny amount of marijuana . " <p> Ms. Naqvi says U.S. immigration laws outline specific categories of crimes and offences that generally categorize inadmissibility offences . Most Canadian business people find themselves questioned about their inadmissibility for instances in their past involving either " controlled substance violations , " which are drug-related offences , and " crimes involving moral turpitude , " which are crimes involving dishonesty .

You may be able to apply for a Nonimmigrant Waiver Of Inadmissibility to the United States . Or you may have to come back with court records demonstrating that the inadmissibility provisions of the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act do n't apply in your case . <p> Even if you are not technically inadmissible to the United States , you may require advance assessment by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Admissibility Review Office to advise of your admissibility in the form of an official letter . <p> In any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , the worst thing to do is to attempt entry at a different border crossing on the same day , thinking you have a fresh chance with a new officer .

In fact , it 's a bad one . <p> Denied admissions are updated in a centralized U.S. database and they are accessible immediately at every U.S. port of entry . This could jeopardize your ability to enter the United States for the rest of your life . <p> So stay calm . Do n't panic . And do n't do anything foolish . Work within the system , and if necessary , work with an immigration lawyer experienced in U.S. law , and chances are you 'll be able to return to the United States without having to worry about that minor criminal issue that arose when you were a wayward 19 year old . <p> March 1 : Admissibility and inadmissibility of Canadians to the United States under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Restrictions <p> All rights reserved .

It is impossible , says Prof. Jin . " The call last weekend for a Tunisia-inspired Jasmine Revolution in Chinaon boxun.com is evidence that there are no social conditions that compare to the Middle East . " <p> But why , then , does the government expend so much energy suppressing any hint of dissent ? <p> " Chinese politicians are always very nervous . That 's their problem . But as an observer , I consider China 's situation very different from that of the Middle East . " <p> Prof. Jin said there are several reasons that China would not see a popular uprising in the near future . China is successful economically , he said , and its power structure more diverse and less corrupt than the regimes of Hosni Mubarak or Moammar Gadhafi . China 's population is also much older than the young and anxious nations of the Middle East .

" I think it 's important to cheer for some things : more freedom of speech , more social justice - but multiparty democracy might not be what we should be cheering for , at least not now . " <p> He said he worried that if a popular revolution took place in the China of 2011 , it could quickly deteriorate into " chaos , followed by a populist strongman ( coming to power ) . It could be something like Vladimir Putin in Russia , it could be something worse . " <p> The Montreal-born Prof. Bell added that while the Chinese have many of the same grievances as the Egyptians did ( a lack of political freedoms , corruption , a widening gap between rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , China 's power structure , with its nine-man Politburo atop many smaller , localized centres of authority , is also very different from the strictly top-down dictatorships of the Middle East . It is thus more flexible in its ability to respond to and manage unrest . <p> " The chances of a ' Jasmine Revolution ' - never mind anything on the scale of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests - are quite small , at least for the foreseeable future . The main reason being that discontent towards the government in China has n't translated into meaningful opposition . <p> " Yet . <p> " China today is different from 1989 . Over the last 20 years , rapid economic growth has raised the standard of living to an unprecedentedly high level . Most families enjoy a lifestyle that previous generations could n't have even imagined . For example , my mom could only afford a small piece of sugar for lunch during the Great Famine in 1960 , but her daughter travelled in three continents before she turned 25 . Few urban Chinese seem eager to trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Butwith so many people in China having access to televisions , cellphones , and the Internet , information is more available than ever before in our history .

If the government does n't find solutions , and fails to reform a political system that is the root cause of many of these problems , then eventually these smaller , local issues will link together and trigger national discontent , or even revolution .

In China , all you need is the mismanagement of growth . <p> " The essential problem for the Communist Party is that almost everyone believes the country needs a new political system . That thought has seeped into people 's consciousness and is shared across society . So China can ' tip , ' to use the phrase popularized by Malcolm Gladwell , because enough people think the same way . ... <p> " The only precondition for mass demonstrations is that people lose their fear .

He has planned everything from downtown Toronto office towers to post-conflict townships in the Balkans . Now , as President and CEO of Simon Fraser University ( SFU ) Community Trust , he oversees the development of UniverCity , an award-winning sustainable urban community adjacent to the university -- and one of the West Coast 's most interesting experiments in developing a brand new sustainable community . On March 1 , Harris will be the guest speaker for the prestigious Brenda and Samuel Gewurz Lectures on Urban Design at McGill at 5:30 p.m. in room G10 , Macdonald-Harrington Building , 815 Sherbrooke West . <p> Q : What makes the UniverCity community on Burnaby Mountain a model for sustainable development ? <p> There are several aspects that make the UniverCity community both noteworthy and unique , starting with SFU Community Trust 's approach to community development . Throughout each stage of UniverCity 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stakeholders to ensure that the new community would integrate residential , commercial and academic uses in a manner that benefits the university while fostering innovative solutions to sustainable living . <p> Acting as a trustee of the lands that comprise UniverCity , the Trust oversees the provision of zoned , serviced , and subdivided sites to developers on a prepaid , long-term ( 99-year ) leasehold basis . Already home to 3,000 people , UniverCity will ultimately reach a population of more than 10,000 . <p> That may sound like a conventional , high-level land-development function ; however , the sites and services we provide -- and the high standard we demand from those developers -- sets us apart . After consulting with the development community , the Trust worked with staff at the City of Burnaby to bring in the most comprehensive set of green building bylaws in North America for the next stage of development at UniverCity . Under these new bylaws , all new buildings must be at least 30 percent more efficient than conventional buildings . <p> As well , going forward , we are working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Canada for Burnaby Mountain that will decrease greenhouse gas emissions by an estimated 67 per cent . <p> Q : I understand that you 're looking at ways to ' fly ' students to campus each day . Can you explain that ? <p> It may sound that way , but we are n't asking students or community members who normally take the bus to grow wings . TransLink , the Metro Vancouver transit authority , estimates that more than 50,000 people commute back and forth to the campus every day . Of those , 34 per cent use transit . We are working with TransLink to come up with a more sustainable and weatherproof way to transport people to and from Burnaby Mountain . <p> If we want to achieve a sustainable state , we have to start thinking about challenges in new ways . Therefore , the system we are currently looking into is a high-speed gondola , which would move up to 3,000 people an hour in less than half the time it takes to cover the same distance by bus . This could see a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transit trips to and from Burnaby Mountain each day , and would initially reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 1,870 tonnes per year . As a gondola is also cheaper to operate , replacing those diesel buses could also save TransLink millions of dollars each year . <p> Q : Universities obviously have a strong emphasis on adult students , but I understand that the UniverCity community on Burnaby Mountain aims to teach children as young as three about sustainability . How are you going to do that ? <p> At UniverCity , we are n't building sustainably to simply lighten our footprint for future generations ; we are planning to teach children in the community about living sustainably and allow them to experience it for themselves . The community is home to a large number of young families -- in fact , 29 per cent of households have children .

As well , the school 's curriculum emphasizes sustainability using the building and the UniverCity community as a teaching tool . <p> The new childcare centre , for youngsters between three and five years old , is currently being developed as one of the first buildings in Canada to meet the Living Building Challenge ? . To achieve that , it must meet a demanding set of guidelines that require the building to generate more energy annually than it uses , to recycle or collect more water than it consumes , to be built free of toxic materials , and to obtain the majority of its materials from within a 500-kilometre radius . This is no small feat , particularly when trying to source materials , like playground slides , close to home . <p> Q : Should n't affordability factor into sustainability ?

In fact , at UniverCity " green , " energy-efficient condos are being built for considerably less and the homeowners save money on their utility bills because the buildings are at least 30 per cent more energy efficient . <p> For example , UniverCity 's award-winning Verdant project is a groundbreaking model of both sustainability and affordability . Developed in partnership with Vancity Enterprises and reSource Rethinking Building and completed in 2007 , Verdant is 60-unit wood-frame building that offers family-oriented housing priced 20 per cent below market . The environmentally friendly building is one of the most energy-efficient wood-frame buildings in Canada and was constructed for approximately $145 per square foot ( a conventional wood-frame condo building would have been closer to $200 a square foot ) . <p> In the case of our new childcare centre , it is being constructed at between $100 and $150 less per square foot than other similar centres in Greater Vancouver . <p> Finally , the new neighbourhood energy utility will see residents in newly planned housing units pay less for heat and hot water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to post comments , please make sure JavaScript and Cookies are enabled , and reload the page.Click here for instructions on how to enable JavaScript in your browser.

You can come up with examples where foreign companies have come and purchased Canadian companies , and within a certain amount of time the business has shut down and production is moved somewhere else .

His solution is to prostitute himself - literally . <p> " He is part of recessionary America , underemployed , constantly in danger of losing his bad teaching job and just generally getting poorer and poorer .

How much sympathetic connection lies beneath our passing laughter depends a lot on whether we read these bad-boy characters as utterly fictional or see them merely as exaggerations of their creators . Is George funny , or should Finkleman just get over himself ? <p> " My id - if I look at the dark side of myself - is my acquisitiveness , my jealousies , my competitiveness , my schadenfreude ... I just let that out to make the show but I do have a superego and in real life I do n't let the idout , " Finkleman said . " It 's a slightly distorted autobiography . It 's not really me but I am looking at certain of my own impulses .

Hung is a critique of the hollowing-out of middle America ; Californication mocks power and celebrity in Hollywood . <p> In that regard , Finkleman scores a lot of points at George 's expense : George 's travails are much more politically pointed than those of Larry on Curb Your Enthusiasm , in which the satire of privilege - a millionaire arguing with children over a dollar - is only oblique . <p> In particular , George 's liberal hypocrisy is continually mocked on Good Dog . In the second episode , Claire tries to convert to Judaism , apparently unaware that her main attraction for George is that , as his friend Doug points out , she 's a shiksa . Except George wo n't say that word because it 's offensive even to him , so he and Doug revert to code . In another episode , George complains to Claire she is not as socially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meat counter where he is placing a large order of prime cuts , he explains that the difference between them is that he knows about the situation in Darfur and she does n't . <p> The joke , of course , is that George is n't doing anything about Darfur . Neither are we for that matter . And neither , for all we know , is Finkleman , but at least he is making us see something , not only in his narcissistic , irritated and irritating id , but in ourselves .

But historians will surely note that for all the rough certainties at the time , the Charlottetown nevertheless sailed off into uncharted waters , and the ship 's crew did not know what new world they might encounter beyond the horizon . None of them even knew when they 'd be coming home . <p> It is a tribute to the pluck of the frigate Charlottetown that it is sailing headlong into the unknown world that the Great Arab revolution of 2010 has set in train . It is a monument to something I ca n't quite put my finger on that while the entire world order was being up-ended -- and as Keith Beardsley puts it , while people are dying in Libya for the right to be able to question their government -- there was all manner of " in and out " warts to be worried and what have you in Ottawa last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Libya . <p> This is indeed an age of discovery and wonder , and the wheat separates from the chaff before our very eyes . As the novelist Salman Rushdie told an Emory University audience just the other day , this could well be " the moment at which the Islamic world moves beyond Islamism . " Rushdie should need no introduction in these affairs but it 's worth mentioning that he is best known for staring down a Khomeinist death-sentence fatwa while much of the Old World quaked and capitulated in its fear , and that Rushdie was right and the cowards were proved wrong . " The west talks a great deal about freedom . Here are people trying to get their freedom , " Rushdie said of the Arab uprisings . " They 're getting it for themselves , and I really hope we can support them . " <p> Rushdie 's point is that whatever storms lies ahead of us -- and there will be gales , and there will be Islamist pirates to contend with -- the sinking hulks of the Muslim Brotherhood 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Al Qaida , are most noticeable in the flotsam in the wake of the young rebel Arab fleets . The old jihadists are weeping and gnashing their teeth now that the very Arabs they claim to champion have so thoroughly exposed them as losers , failures , and yesterday 's men . Confront the Islamists , Rushdie exhorts , but do not fear the " fanatical bogeyman " of yesterday 's world . <p> Yet it is exactly that bogeyman that looms on Michael Scheuer 's fanciful horizons , and nobody speaks for the old flat-earth school of foreign policy quite like Scheuer does . But nevermind what I say about Scheuer . What he says for himself is that the Iraqi gargoyle Saddam Hussein and the Egyptian vampire Hosni Mubarak were " Israel 's two anti-Islamist shields , " and their exits are losses to be lamented .

If free speech scares you , ban it ; if you are scared by what people say , jail them ; if this does n't work , blame Zionist sorcerers , which is what Scheuer has been doing for some while now , sounding for all the world like Mahmoud Ahmedinejad as he does so . How do the Israeli wizards go about their mysterious alchemy ? Why , by such means as establishing the Holocaust Museum in Washington , D.C. to guilt-trip and insinuate their way into the highest command centres of American imperialist shenanigans .

To have been merely in the room at any point during the most tragic and embarassing American intelligence failure since Pearl Harbour is a thing to wave around under our noses as cause to be taken seriously in these matters ? As the CIA 's Office of Inspector-General would later put it in a retrospective evaluation , most of the brainiacs in the Bin Laden unit " did not have the operational experience , expertise and training necessary to accomplish their mission in an effective manner .

It 's how Fouad Ajami , in the New York Times , describes what he hears when he listens to Scheuer : " Aye , aye ! they were mine -- my irons , cried Ahab , exultantly . . . . Aye , I see -- wanted to part it ; free the fast fish -- an old trick -- I know him .

He 's one of the most beloved pundits of the " anti-war " crowd . Oh look , here 's another one of his pundittos now : " Barack Obama , Interventionist and Ultimate Jihadi Hero .

Williams had set the process in motion . <p> The correct wording <p> More mundane tasks were at hand in Victoria . Allan was determined that all of his well-wishers receive personal notes -- not a form letter -- to their letters of congratulations .

He gave up a law practice during what would have been his best earning years to devote his time to the province . Appointed labour minister during a time of serious labour unrest , he was determined to make an impact . Not that he might not have preferred another portfolio -- attorney general , perhaps -- but within the Bennett cabinet he was the obvious choice for the job . Smart . Level-headed .

He remembered meeting with him shortly after Allan got the call from Bennett asking him to accept the labour portfolio . Allan was grim and stone-faced . <p> " What 's the problem , " Moonen asked , " you get labour ? " <p> Williams did not reply . <p> I would sit in on meetings with Allan , his deputy minister , Jim Matkin , and the union leaders of the day as they thrashed out the province 's industrial relations problems ( " challenges , " they would be called today . ) It was a subject I knew nothing about but was fascinated to see in action .

And almost always he would introduce an element of surprise -- an angle that had occurred to him during the course of the discussion -- something the others had n't considered . It was n't for effect . It was just the way he thought . Out of the box , as it later came to be called . <p> In the early years of his ministry , we worked every night the Legislature was in session . After the house rose at 6 p.m. the two of us headed to the Victoria 's Union Club for dinner . To the bar for a single martini . Downstairs to the dining room . Back to the office by 8 p.m . Few , if any , ministers ' offices would be open when we left at 11 p.m . We 'd go for a beer . I 'd buy . Allan always bought dinner . <p> The labour years took a toll on him . With the election call of 1979 , I felt he should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make up for the earnings losses of the previous four years . " You going to run again ? " I asked . <p> " One more kick at the can , " he said . <p> I wished he had n't . He was appointed attorney general and was dealt the Clifford Olson affair . When the issue arose of a payment of $100,000 to Olson 's wife in return to information on the whereabouts of the bodies of the children Olson killed , it was not one that could be taken to cabinet . It was a decision the attorney general had to make as the chief law officer of the Crown . <p> He made it . He agonized over it . And he was second guessed by lesser people . It was the correct decision , of course . But I do not believe he ever enjoyed politics after that , and he chose not to run again in 1983 . <p> A destiny spelled out <p> His full name was Louis Allan Williams. ? <p> Walking to the Union Club one night after he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general ) , I told him I was amused by the fact his initials spelled LAW. ? <p> Yes , he said , and went on to tell me his first name was actually spelled A-L-L-E-N .

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Graham Hughes <p> 2011-03-10 12:14:00 <p> ANAHEIM , Calif. - Jonas Hiller would rather have a broken arm . <p> Give him a sprained ankle , or even a nasty case of the flu . <p> Just about any ailment would be better than vertigo , which has kept the Anaheim Ducks ' Swiss goalie off the ice for all but four periods since he played in his first all-star game six weeks ago . <p> " At least with a broken leg , they can tell you how long it 's going to be until you can play again , " Hiller said . <p> Nobody can explain why Hiller 's incredible reflexes and puck vision suddenly were enveloped by a fog of dizziness and fatigue in early February . Nobody is sure why Hiller feels perfectly normal away from the rink , and nobody can tell him when -- or whether -- it will go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues , especially on the ice , " Hiller said . " I start feeling out of myself , kind of feeling all over the place . I guess it 's just going to take time . All I can do is be patient . It 's definitely not easy , especially the mental side . It 's really tough . " <p> Hiller missed his 10th consecutive game Wednesday night for the Ducks , who are scrapping to get into the West 's crowded playoff picture with 15 games left in the regular season . He has sat out 13 games and played just once since getting pulled from his first start after the break , when he began falling into a lightheaded stupor whenever he tried to stop pucks . <p> " It feels like I 'm always falling behind the play , " said Hiller , 26-16-3 with five shutouts this season . " It 's like I ca n't keep up with the puck any more . I might be physically there , but I always feel like my head 's not there yet . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for half a second or something . I 'm always trying to catch up , which throws me off even more . " <p> Anaheim has suited up five goalies in his absence . Newcomer Dan Ellis has been effective over the past two weeks , and the Ducks entered Thursday 's games just two points out of eighth place in the Western Conference . <p> Vertigo is a particularly cruel affliction for Hiller , whose entire career is built on reflexes and smarts . <p> He went undrafted and unnoticed as a teenager , but got attention while playing with Joe Thornton and Rick Nash in Switzerland during the NHL lockout . Hiller unseated longtime Ducks starter Jean-Sebastien Giguere two years ago and earned a US$18-million , four-year contract last season . <p> The malady hit Hiller at the peak of his career . He had won nine games in a four-week stretch heading into the all-star game , where he was the only Western Conference goalie invited . The first Swiss all-star goalie was among the league leaders in most goaltending statistics at the time , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shots hit Hiller squarely in his mask during the all-star weekend in Raleigh , N.C. , the doctors do n't know if that jarring had anything to do with his vertigo . He was pulled from the first period of his first game back against San Jose , and he sat out the next three games before shutting out Edmonton on Feb. 13 after a visit to a chiropractor in Vancouver . <p> The symptoms returned , and Hiller has n't played since . He spends his days undergoing tests and skating in practice , but the vertigo always surfaces when he gets in game conditions -- or even when he just works out aggressively in the Ducks ' gym . <p> " I know most of the doctors in Orange County right now , " he said . " There 's so many things involved . Even vertigo , there 's a wide possibility of what it could be . " <p> The Ducks ca n't wait for Hiller , so they 've attempted to stay in the race without their single most important player . <p> After backup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19 goals in a four-game stretch , Anaheim took on salary while shipping him to Tampa Bay in a trade for Ellis , the former Nashville starter . The Ducks also signed veteran Ray Emery , but he has n't cracked the lineup with Ellis taking over . <p> " Dan has given us a chance to win games , and that 's all we ask our goalies to do , " Carlyle said after Ellis improved to 4-1-1 with Anaheim on Wednesday night in a victory over the New York Rangers . " He stepped in and made some critical saves at important times . " <p> Hiller said his doctors have encouraged him to " keep provoking the symptoms " with tough workouts and puck-stopping drills . They want him to keep putting his body into difficult circumstances , hopefully forcing his mind out of a virtual rut . <p> So far , it is n't working -- but Hiller remains faintly hopeful he 'll get himself together in time to help the Ducks . <p> " Every time I push it a little , it 's almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some days I feel pretty good , and it feels like the next day is going to be fine .

@@4044231 <h> Artist explodes Pamela 's bombshell persona <h> Celebrity culture gets tweaked in smart , savvy multimedia show <p> My Life with Pamela Anderson , a multimedia show by Kristin Nelson , is a clever , crafty bit of fiction . Nelson has never met Anderson , the Canadian-born actress , PETA pin-up girl and Borat faux-kidnapping target . <p> It 's a fiction that happens to be true , though . In a sense , we 're all living with Pamela Anderson , surrounded as we are by the incessant chatter of celebrity culture . The Ontario-born , Winnipeg-based Nelson has just decided to talk back , meeting the tabloid iconography of Anderson halfway with a collection of sweetly subversive textile pieces , texts and photographs . <p> The 43-year-old Anderson , famously discovered at a B.C. Lions football game , is best known as the busty blond star of Baywatch , a TV series about California lifeguards in which saving people from drowning involved a lot of slow-motion running in red bathing suits . While some SSRq80s feminist artists might have felt obligated to denounce Anderson 's embodiment of an unrealistic , hyper-sexualized stereotype , Third Wave feminists like Nelson are happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe even have some fun with it . <p> The show is anchored by outsized banners . In one Anderson wears cowboy boots , a cowboy hat and a come-hither look , in another a silvery , skimpy Barbarella outfit and peep-toe pumps . What might have been obvious , show-stopping spectacle becomes beautifully subtle through Nelson 's use of cross-stitch , a craft technique once associated with homey needlework samplers . ( The backsides of the aluminium panels are a tangle of threads , giving evidence of Nelson 's intricate and intensive labour . ) <p> The repeating grid structure of cross-stitch perfectly replicates the pixels of digital photography . Suspended between representation and abstraction , between an image that is being built up and one that is being broken down , these works position Anderson as a mirage of desirability shimmering just out of focus . Meanwhile , the pieces ' lengthy titles -- one talks about Anderson 's vocal support for animal rights -- reference Anderson as a flesh-and-blood woman , with problems and passions like anyone else . <p> Another series of works involves a comic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of herself and digitally inserts Anderson , so that the two appear to be snorkelling in a lake or biking on a country road in a wistfully idealized version of a girls ' day out . Their imagined friendship gently questions what it means when we feel as if we know a celebrity . <p> Rejecting the idea that we have to be passive consumers of gossip shows and dupes of tabloid headlines , Nelson takes a cheerful , cheeky view of pop culture . Proactive and participatory , she goes beyond the pre-packaged version of Anderson to find a woman she likes , understands and admires . <p> The show includes some of Nelson 's older work , including a series of Drag King Playing Cards , small photos of drag kings with their " stats " on the back . This work , which is about gender as a cultural performance , connects to the main show and to Nelson 's belief that Anderson herself is a kind of brilliant drag act . ( Pamela Anderson may be a woman playing a woman , but it all rests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex-bomb persona . ) <p> The side gallery features some older work about urban issues and community , including a very Winnipeggy series of small , sharp etchings of surface parking lots . While these pieces showcase Nelson 's intellectual depth and multimedia range , they dilute the main exhibition 's Pamela-centric concentration . <p> You can comment on most stories on winnipegfreepress.com .

If your self-esteem is based on how you look , then Facebook is a great place to advertise that , " said Dr. Stefanone , who looks at the social psychology of new media use . <p> Women generally disclose more on Facebook than men , sharing more photos and spending more time on the site , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journal Cyberpsychology , Behavior and Social Networking . <p> Although the authors make no guesses as to whether the women - all university students - will grow out of their preening ways , some experts suggest it has always been women 's place to catalogue life through photos . <p> The findings come amid news that Canadians spend more time online than anyone else on the planet - 43.5 hours a month , nearly double the worldwide average of 23.1 hours , according to data from Web research firm comScore released this week . Those numbers follow earlier trends that have shown Canadians to be voracious users of Facebook . <p> According to Facebook , users share more than 30 billion pieces of content ( including photo albums , posts and links ) each month . <p> The current Facebook study attempts to explain the appeal . Conducted last spring , the study involved 311 university students , half women , half men , with an average age of 23.3 years old.Each subject completed a questionnaire called the Contingencies of Self-Worth Scale , which measures people 's sources of self-esteem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including the amount of time they spent online , the number of photos they shared and the size of their online networks . <p> Men had fewer friends and photos and spent less time managing their profiles than women . The subset of women who based their identity on their appearance were the most " prolific in sharing photos online , " Dr. Stefanone said . <p> On the other hand , women who said they based their self-worth on more traditional , personal domains such as family and " virtue " spent less time shaping their online personas than their more visual female counterparts . <p> Although both groups of women had the same amount of photos , " their motivations for using the technology were different , " Dr. Stefanone said . <p> " These tended to be stronger ties with people they knew and communicated often with and felt emotionally close to . They were using it to maintain actual relationships instead of engaging in this attention-seeking behaviour .

" <p> The research echoes those of a 2008 study out of the University of Georgia , which found that users with an abundance of flattering photos , self-promoting wall posts and friends often qualify as narcissists , people who , according to the study , use social relationships to boost their status and self-esteem . <p> Those findings mirror a previous study of Dr. Stefanone 's , which showed that heavy consumers of mass media were often guilty of " promiscuous friending , " making friends online with people they 'd never met before . <p> " This is consistent with celebrity status , " he argues . " Celebrities have massive , abstract audiences that observe them . " <p> As for his current findings , they " help to explain why women use the site more than men , " said Emily Christofides , a doctoral candidate in psychology at the University of Guelph who researches the social effects of new media . <p> Along with her colleague Amy Muise , Ms. Christofides has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posting more photos and whiling away more hours on Facebook than men . <p> " If their self-worth is more closely linked with their image and appearance , then it would be more important to carefully manage that on Facebook .

@@4050231 <h> Fulford : William Toye 's book smarts <p> In 1948 , when William Toye was about to graduate from the University of Toronto , what he wanted most in the world was a job in Canadian book publishing . This was an outlandish career plan , since Canadian publishing barely existed . We had few publishers and they produced few books . They spent much of their time importing whatever the Americans and the British published . They kept afloat by selling Bibles , dictionaries and schoolbooks . Was this any way for a bright young man to start out ? <p> But young Toye saw his destiny and insisted on it . When he applied for a job at the Canadian branch of Oxford University Press , he was told they had nothing for him but a place in the warehouse . He said that would be fine . <p> Over the next six decades Canadian publishing steadily expanded and Toye found many ways to deploy the talents he developed . At age 84 , still editing , he recently produced yet another in the long list of valuable books he 's given us , The Concise Oxford Companion to Canadian Literature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like all of his books it 's handsome , the classic Bembo type arranged in readable and elegant columns , the prose sharp and effective , crackling with literate enthusiasm . Toye has been working this beat for decades and it may be that in studying , selecting and analyzing this material he 's become more knowledgeable about the breadth of Canadian writing , English and French , than anyone else alive . <p> This is a book for casual reading as well as an essential work of reference . After it arrived , as I was glancing at the design , it fell open at the entry on a biographer , Elspeth Cameron : " In 1997 Cameron surprised everyone with an autobiographical work , No Previous Experience : A Memoir of Love and Change , about her subservience to her husbands , the breakup of her third marriage , and her lesbian relationship with a professor at the University of Calgary ( which eventually ended ) . " <p> That 's a striking reminder of how a Toye book not only describes Canadian literature but embodies it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our experience of Canada in that era . <p> When applied to this book , " concise " means 704 pages , but there 's a lot to cover . Hundreds of authors and many publishers get brief , authoritative articles . Certain famous books , from Mazo de la Roche 's Jalna to Leonard Cohen 's Beautiful Losers , are given entries of their own -- and in one long paragraph Toye offers an account of Cohen 's famously tangled novel that 's quite astonishingly lucid . <p> Another nice piece discusses one of the very few 19th-century Canadian books that never go out of print , Wild Animals I Have Known , written in 1898 by the great naturalist Ernest Thompson Seton . A few articles deal with literary oddities , like the line " O God ! O Montreal ! " ( a favourite of Mordecai Richler and other satirists ) , written in 1875 by Samuel Butler when he was marooned in Montreal long enough to discover the depths of its provincial puritanism . <p> Toye has brought hundreds of the articles up to date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems eager to convey his own pleasure in the discovery of relatively new institutions , such as Biblioasis , a literary magazine in Windsor , or relatively recent literary reputations , such as Charlotte Gray 's for biography and Christian B ? k 's for poetry . He describes Gray 's Mrs. King , about the mother of Mackenzie King , in a way that makes me eager to get my hands on that book , which I unfortunately neglected when it was current . Turning to B ? k 's work , Toye seems fascinated by Eunoia , the book in which B ? k 's Herculean ingenuity manipulates the language , determining that each of his " chapters " uses only one vowel , as in " Helen , the new-wed empress , weeps . Restless , she deserts her fleece bed where , detested , her wedded regent sleeps . " <p> Toye 's own life in letters has been as remarkable as many of the careers described in his books . After starting at the bottom , he eventually learned the techniques of book production , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books known in universities and schools . He wrote children 's books and edited Marshall McLuhan 's letters . He taught himself typography , not an easy thing to do . <p> He became the first and for many years the only Canadian author or editor who could both provide the content of a book and design it at a high level . ( Now there 's one other Canadian who can turn the same trick , Robert Bringhurst . ) In 1956 , when Robert Weaver organized The Tamarack Review , he recruited Toye as an editor and designer ; Toye stayed with The Tamarack through its quarter of a century as the leading literary magazine in English Canada . <p> Almost alone in his profession , Toye has had exactly one full-time employer . He joined Oxford in 1948 , stayed there till he retired in 1991 and then began freelancing for Oxford . His long service in the trench warfare of editing was recognized by Oxford University . <p> On a September day in 1995 , suitably gowned , he walked across the Oxford campus to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site of sacred Oxford rituals .

" Educated at the University of Toronto , he has shown himself a true Oxford man , " the orator said . That 's the kindest thing anybody at Oxford could possibly say , if not precisely the way a Canadian patriot would put it . Gulielmum was then installed as an honorary Master of Arts . <p> Writers edited by Toye often describe him as tough and demanding . He 's polite and encouraging , but while he speaks softly he carries a big blue pencil . He 's never reluctant to ask for a new draft , and then perhaps a second or third , if he sees the need .

As the event is a high profile affair , the NYPD deems it a possible terrorist target which typically qualifies it as an ESU operation . <p> The annual tree-lighting is attended by thousands with the overwhelming majority being tourists from other states and regions within the U.S. or abroad . <p> Four days prior to the Rockefeller Center incident , an ESU detective accidentally fired a shotgun round while emerging from his vehicle as he was responding to a report of a barricaded gunman at West 136 Street in Harlem . <p> The shotgun blast blew out a window in a nearby apartment building but fortunately no one was harmed in that incident either . <p> Early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning hours of January 22 , the third and final accidental discharge occurred and resulted in an unintentional shooting that left an elderly man severely wounded . <p> In that particular incident an ESU team found themselves in the Soundview section of the Bronx at 3AM , pounding on the door to a residence that contained Alberto Colon , 41 , a drug dealer whom the NYPD had a warrant to arrest . He resided at the residence with his two elderly parents - Jose Colon , 76 , and Maria Colon . <p> The banging by the ESU cops at the door woke the elder Colon from his sleep who then got out of bed , scared and in his pajamas , to investigate who would be pounding on his door at such an ungodly hour and for what reason . As he approached the front door , ESU kicked it down and swept into his home . <p> In an account of the incident as told by Colon to the Daily News , he says that cops flashed a light in his face and shouted , " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the cops fired a single round that struck him . <p> That single round tore through Colon 's midsection and became lodged in his pelvis . <p> He says that after he was shot he begged them not to shoot him anymore as one of the raiding ESU officers laid him down on the floor and said , " Do n't Move ! " <p> As Colon laid on the floor , the 76 year-old man said he thought he was going to die and began praying . He would wake up in Jacobi Hospital after spending two weeks unconscious , breathing with the aid of a respirator . During his period of convalescence , Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Police Commissioner Ray Kelly would visit and express wishes for a speedy recovery . <p> Meanwhile , the true target of the raid - Alberto , was apprehended . Officers also uncovered a small stash of heroin belonging to the suspect . <p> Colon has recuperated enough that he is now back at home with his wife and is gearing up for legal action . Through Manhattan lawyers Alan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim , alerting the city and the NYPD that he intends to sue for $20 million . <p> NYPD sources said the single round fired that struck 76 year-old Jose Colon during the raid was from the 9-mm semiautomatic handgun of ESU Detective Andrew McCormack . The NYPD also said that the light Colon saw before he was shot was that of the flashlight mounted on McCormack 's handgun . <p> He was also reportedly the first member through the door into the dwelling when the raid commenced . <p> According to further statements from the NYPD , McCormack - an 11-year decorated member of the force - accidentally fired the round while trying to switch on the flashlight attached to his gun . <p> However , Figman took issue with the NYPD 's version of events and told the Daily News that McCormack should have been prepared for an encounter in poor lighting , given the hour of the raid . <p> " Why not simply turn on the light before the door is battered in ? " he argued . <p> McCormack has been assigned to administrative duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bronx District Attorney 's Office is investigating the incident and McCormack could possibly face criminal charges if he is deemed to be negligent in the shooting of the 76 year-old man . <p> In an odd twist , McCormack is the son of a cop killed nearly 30 years ago . His dad , Officer Joseph McCormack , was fatally shot on Sept. 29 , 1983 , while on duty in the Bronx . <p> The elder McCormack , then 40 , was also a member of the Emergency Service Unit when he responded to an incident involving a mentally disturbed gunman barricaded in a house on Mulford Avenue in Pelham Bay . The gunman fired a blast from a shotgun that ricocheted off a tree and struck the cop through an opening in his bulletproof vest . Other ESU officers on the scene returned fire , killing the gunman . <p> When it was discovered that her husband was slain due to bulletproof vest he was wearing being defective , Susan McCormack became a tireless advocate in obtaining improved and updated equipment for ESU members . According to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vest that had gaps of protection on the side . <p> She also started a support group for police widows in the wake of her husband 's death .. <p> Andrew McCormick was ten years-old at the time of his father 's death . <p> Andrew and his older brother Joseph Jr. , are both NYPD officers and members of ESU . In fact , Joseph Jr . is a NYPD sergeant in the unit . <p> Joseph Jr . was one of many ESU officers to respond to the World Trade Center on that infamous Tuesday morning of 9/11 when al-Qaida terrorists hijacked four commercial airliners and used two of them to attack the twin 110-story towers at the complex . Joseph Jr . barely got clear of the towers when they collapsed , claiming the lives of 23 other NYPD officers , 14 of whom belonged to ESU <p> Meanwhile , in a recent interview with The New York Times in the wake of the wrongful shooting by her youngest son , Ms. McCormick from her upstate New York home , ponders the possibility that an equipment failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , much the same way faulty equipment played a primary role in the death of her husband decades ago . <p> Now with Andrew McCormick , her youngest son , facing possible criminal charges , it would appear more and more as if ESU is somewhat of a tragic legacy for Ms. McCormick and her sons . <p> NYPD Findings on November Shootings , Focus on Training <p> The Daily News reports that Chief Charles Kammerdener , head of the Special Operations Division , said the NYPD conducted a review into all of the accidental firings and found that none of the weapons malfunctioned which is another way of saying that all of these incidents are strictly the result of human error . <p> Though some of the shootings are high-profile in nature , ESU weapon discharges typically represent a small number of the NYPD 's overall annual total of accidental discharges . <p> According to NYPD records for the year of 2009 , there were 23 incidents where officers accidentally discharged their weapons with only one of those incidents belonging to ESU While 2010 records show that there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incidents involving ESU in November . <p> The NYPD has taken some corrective action in light of the ESU shooting mishaps . As a result of the Rockefeller Center incident ESU sharpshooter training has been revised to high light the weapon 's safety position . <p> However , some unidentified members of ESU who spoke to the Daily News told the publication that the shooting mishaps of late were the result of a reduction in annual refresher training for the elite squad . In particular , they noted the cut of a week-long weapons training course and shooting exercise at Camp Smith or Fort Dix . <p> NYPD leadership vehemently denies any statements that ESU training has been cut . In fact , they claim the exact opposite and have said that training for the legendary outfit has never been more frequent in the unit 's history than it is now . <p> In response to ESU officer claims of a reduction in training , Deputy Police Commissioner Paul Browne made the following statement to the Daily News : <p> ESU has never received more training that it has now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that they are the front line of an NYPD response . So to try to make such a connection is disingenuous . <p> Amongst The Very Best at What They Do <p> ESU is a multi-purpose specialized unit trained to perform the most daunting of rescue operations as well as tactical ( SWAT ) operations . They are the NYPD 's go-to team for the most high-profile , dangerous , complex and sensitive operations . As part of their duties as a tactical team the elite outfit is charged with facing off against the most dangerous and desperate individuals and groups in society ranging from disgruntled gunmen , armed robbers , murderers , gang members and violent drug dealers and even terrorists . <p> ESU has a national and international reputation for it 's diverse skill set and the uniqueness of the operations it tackles . The elite unit takes pride in being able to confront the most complex of crisis situations and effecting favorable outcomes for the NYPD and the city . <p> As part of their tactical training , ESU is skilled in the execution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armed adversaries . This type of training is high-level and complicated . It is practiced only by advanced level tactical teams in law enforcement and the military . It is fast-paced and involves the practice of engaging armed adversaries inside of dwellings that may be compact in nature and filled with hostages . ESU itself is one of the best tactical teams in existence in this type of skill . <p> In hostage rescue and CQB , being able to control your weapon and having trigger control are of paramount importance . The margin for error - if it exists at all - is extremely small . Because many hostage rescue operations take place in close quarters conditions , a discharged stray shot can strike a hostage or a fellow team member or possibly cause unnecessary harm to a suspect . A clear example of the dangers of poor weapons discipline during a close quarters operation would be that of the earlier noted case of the the inert shot fired by McCormack which seriously wounded the elderly Colon during a drug raid . <p> It is for this reason and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the potential to be problematic .

@@4060231 <p> The Peace Athabasca Delta will feature ongoing monitoring under a new group composed of government agencies , Aboriginal groups and environmental NGOs . <p> By SHAWN BELL , SRJ Reporter <p> * <p> Communities downstream of Alberta 's oilsands are banding together , trying to figure out for themselves the answers to the burning questions of life in the North : is the water safe to drink and are the animals safe to eat ? Local , community-based monitoring systems are springing from those connections , setting up for the day local governments and Aboriginal groups actually complete their own ecosystem monitoring . <p> It is , as one participant from the NWT M ? t is Nation put it , flip-flopping the usual methods , where scientists come to communities and monitor the environment with no local involvement at all . <p> Meanwhile , two of the most influential panels on water monitoring ever established in western Canada are meeting in the south , trying to create a " world-class " monitoring system for the Athabasca River as it passes through Alberta 's oilsands region . <p> While efforts are seemingly being made by the panels to involve local communities downstream , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge and answer community concerns remains to be seen . <p> There is no denying the water passing through the oilsands industry ends up far downstream . <p> It is also undeniable that traditional Aboriginal knowledge rang ok the alarm bells on serious changes to the environment downstream , from Fort Chipewyan in northern Alberta to Fort Resolution on the shores of Great Slave Lake . <p> Anxiety is rising among many people in the North that the monitoring work happening upstream will ignore the lives , and the land , downstream . <p> ' World class ' monitoring : will downstream communities be involved ? <p> Both the Alberta and federal governments have expert panels in place , tasked with determining the future of water monitoring of the Athabasca River and surrounding land . <p> Alberta 's panel was formed in late January 2011 , after independent scientists including Dr. David Schindler of the University of Alberta released a paper in the fall of 2010 showing a range of toxic chemicals ending up downstream as far as the Peace Athabasca Delta . <p> Environment Canada formed a similar panel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research . <p> Meanwhile another Alberta panel of scientists released a report on the oilsands on March 8 , clearly recommending that " local communities " be involved in the creation and implementation of monitoring work coming out of the panel 's discussions . <p> Two spokespeople for those downstream communities ? Chief Allan Adam of Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation ( ACFN ) and NWT Environment Minister Michael Miltenberger ? say they have been invited to the table and their people 's voices will be heard . <p> " It sounds like something is actually happening , " Adam said , guardedly optimistic after being invited to meet with the Alberta panel on April 20 . " But we 'll have to wait and see if the meetings are satisfactory . " <p> Miltenberger has been invited to present the NWT 's perspective to the Environment Canada panel in early April . He also has one of his staff sitting on the panel : Dr. Erin Kelly , one of the scientists who worked with Dr. David Schindler on the oilsands pollution studies that spurred both governments to action . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business , " Miltenberger said . " So we 're there at the table . " But spokespeople for both federal and Alberta governments were evasive when asked how downstream communities could make their concerns known to the panels . <p> Jessica Potter of Alberta Environment said a website was being created to allow members of the public and community leaders to provide input . That website should be online in a few weeks , she said . <p> And Mark Johnson with Environment Canada would only reply to questions with a terse statement saying that the government is " committed to action the recommendations of the federal panel oilsands report of Dec. 2010 . " <p> PADEMP well ahead of the game <p> Meanwhile First Nations around the Peace Athabasca Delta are already working together with government agencies on a monitoring program for the troubled delta . <p> The Peace Athabasca Delta Environmental Monitoring Program ( PADEMP ) was brought together by Parks Canada , and includes Environment Canada , Alberta Environment , the government of the NWT , eleven First Nation and M ? t is groups and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regime . <p> Nearly three years since starting the round-table discussions , the group has completed an inventory of previous and ongoing monitoring work , and come close to finishing a vulnerability assessment of the delta that will guide monitoring going forward . <p> It has taken a while to get this point , said Rhona Kindopp , an ecosystem scientist with Wood Buffalo National Park and member of PADEMP . <p> But she argued that the time was well-spent developing relationships and figuring out how to work together . <p> " One of the big things we 've learned is that there is a great value in listening to another person 's perspective , listening and empathizing with where they are coming from , " Kindopp said . " I feel the program has been successful because we 've allowed the time to do that . " <p> Kindopp noted that Aboriginal people living in northern Alberta and the NWT have long been frustrated by scientists coming into their homeland and doing studies without local involvement . <p> One of PADEMP 's big successes was utilizing traditional Aboriginal knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way to combine that knowledge with Western science to identify gaps in current monitoring regimes and threats to the delta , she said . <p> Victor Marie of the Salt River First Nation in Fort Smith , a member of PADEMP , said that use of traditional knowledge goes a long way towards an understanding of the ecosystem . <p> " Native people have travelled up and down these rivers . They know what is happening with the fish , the waterfowl and the water . You do n't have to tell a native person something is wrong , " Marie said . <p> PADEMP , however , has not completely gotten away from the usual mode of monitoring . While local communities and Aboriginal groups will set the parameters for the science being done , Parks Canada staff will likely complete the majority of actual monitoring , considering the inaccessibility of most of the delta . <p> Slave River community monitoring takes a step further <p> Only two months in , the Slave River Community-based Monitoring Partnership ( SRCMP ) has used PADEMP as a model and taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tasked with monitoring the Slave River from the point it leaves the Peace Athabasca Delta until it enters Great Slave Lake , not only includes Aboriginal groups and local communities in identifying risks and setting up the parameters of monitoring . The SRCMP plans to actually call on community governments , including First Nation bands and other organizations , to do the monitoring and submit results to the government partners . <p> The government of the NWT is heavily involved , under its well-regarded Water Strategy . So is Environment Canada and Indian and Northern Affairs . But the main focus is on the Aboriginal partners , both in creating the monitoring system and doing the work . <p> Miltenberger said his government sees the Slave River as a focal point for all of the NWT 's water , and information on the health of its ecosystem as key in forming transboundary water agreements with Alberta and British Columbia . <p> Aboriginal governments in the region have commended the Slave River monitoring program , calling it a new way forward when it comes to water monitoring . <p> Tim Heron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to both PADEMP and SRCMP , said both the federal and territorial governments have realized they can not do the work alone . <p> " It 's a new thinking from government , " Heron said . " It 's flipped-flopped , and now it 's coming from the community level up . " <p> The future of monitoring <p> The new approach to water monitoring on the Peace Athabasca Delta and the Slave River has gotten off to a good start . All parties are still at the table , working together , despite having political differences and , in some cases , long histories of opposition . As Connie Benwell of Salt River First Nation said , " water is our main source of life ; " it is bigger than politics . <p> Both groups know any monitoring done in isolation of surrounding regions is futile . They have promised to work together , using similar parameters so data can be easily compared . <p> But Alberta 's oilsands are the elephant in the room when it comes to any downstream water issues . As nearly everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the oilsands are by far the main concern with water quality upstream . <p> To that end , the PADEMP group has written to Environment Canada , asking to be included in the monitoring system that gets established for the Athabasca River and to be the conduit through which Peace Athabasca Delta monitoring work gets completed . <p> And as all representatives of downstream jurisdictions noted , the people making decisions on how the Athabasca River and its tributaries get monitored should not forget the communities relying on that water . <p> Whether that advice gets taken , as expert scientists from across North America set about creating a world-class monitoring regime for the Athabasca River , remains to be seen .

@@4065231 <p> The land beneath the Richmond and Adelaide street off-ramps just west of the Don Valley Parkway is a mess of giant puddles and construction detritus . A pile of plastic sheeting blows past discarded wooden pallets and torrents of spring runoff spill over crumbling curbs . <p> A steady hum of traffic drifts down from above , while a barricade of metal fencing leans under the weight of billboards painted with a colourful , tree-filled landscape , a literal sign of what 's to come . <p> This , a place that could have been used as a backdrop for the apocalyptic saga The Road , is where the city expects people to hang out . <p> Next month , construction will begin in this practically invisible pocket of land just north of Eastern Avenue . The plans for Underpass Park , a highly landscaped development directly under a pair of busy roadways , were announced last year to a barrage of hype that was fuelled mostly by disbelief . <p> " Toronto is so boring , its residents will attend the opening of an underpass , " culture writer Rosemary Heather posted on her Twitter feed . <p> Located smack in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the future site of the Pan Am Games athletes ' village , the park will feature moveable coffee kiosks , public basketball courts and an ambitious work of public art hung from the highway itself . <p> It 's a bold re-imagining for a town where underpasses are generally regarded as nothing more than graffiti galleries and pigeon coops . Linger too long under most Toronto roadways and you get the distinct feeling that something disgusting is going to drip onto your head , and it wo n't be sliding off a piece of art . <p> But some urban thinkers are beginning to see the spaces as the downtown 's untapped natural assets , and say that beautifying them could completely change the way people move around the city . <p> " Toronto 's got all sorts of overpasses and roadways , and I think there are places that could be really interesting if enough imagination was brought to bear , " said Greg Smallenberg , the Vancouver-based landscape architect who designed Underpass Park . <p> In New York City , transit commissioner Janette Sadik-Khan transformed a parking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public park simply by painting a white border around it and laying down some grass , completely changing the neighbourhood . <p> " It was a quick way of showing you can transform a space in a matter of hours instead of a matter of years , " she recently told Esquire magazine . <p> Granville Island in Vancouver is perhaps the most successful underpass development in the country ; it 's a bustling community , parts of which are carved out beneath the Granville Street Bridge . <p> Before it was developed into a public market , the False Creek area around the bridge was a polluted industrial wasteland , said Mr. Smallenberg . <p> " For a year and a half it was a dead zone . Everybody thought it was going to be an absolute white elephant , " he said of the area 's redevelopment . " Now it 's elbow room only to get your fresh fruit and vegetables . " <p> While Underpass Park is intended to be a thoroughfare rather than a destination , making it more palatable to walk from one side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new way of thinking about the city 's unused space . <p> The new Dufferin Street extension north of Queen Street West has created a brightly lit underpass , which serves as a pristine point of comparison to the dingy , constantly flooded sidewalks running east-west . <p> But by far the worst underpass is the stretch of space beneath the Gardiner Expressway . <p> A windy , desolate expanse that cuts the city off from its waterfront , Mr. Smallenberg calls the underpass " one of the most inhospitable pieces of road in Canada . " <p> " I do n't see the Gardiner so much as the villain , " he said , " I see Lake Shore as the villain . " <p> Waterfront Toronto is currently doing environmental assessments of four tentative plans to deal with the Gardiner , one of which , in the words of chief executive officer John Campbell , involves " tarting up " the space underneath . <p> But some initial steps have already been taken . This spring , the city is scraping and repainting the minty green beams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bents have already been pressure-washed into a lighter shade of grey . <p> Two years ago , the city held a competition to select a piece of public art that would be installed beneath the Gardiner in front of Fort York . The winner , called Watertable , by artists Lisa Steele and Kim Tomczak , illuminates the underside of the highway with waves of light that mark the original shoreline of Lake Ontario . <p> " It 's one of those spaces where people kept asking ' Where is it , where is it ? ' " said Mr. Tomczak . " Of course , they 've been there many times . " <p> Although most people move through the Gardiner underpass as quickly as possible , Ms. Steele points out that the space is becoming more valuable as the area surrounding it develops . <p> " It will be the front yard of thousands of people , " she said . " It will just , de facto , be used . " <p> Through their work on Watertable , the couple said they fell in love with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majestic and even " beautiful . " <p> The pair said it was satisfying to create a work of art in an area that is considered uninhabitable and even dangerous . <p> " You want to affect some kind of change in your audience and often we do n't get to see it , but we could certainly see it this time , " said Ms. Steele . <p> A little farther to the east , near the corner of Lake Shore and Dan Leckie Way , artist Pierre Poussin created Mitosis Courtyard , a permanent piece of public art underneath the Gardiner that was commissioned for the Panorama condominium complex . <p> " There are a lot of areas of Toronto that are neglected and there so many great opportunities to create unique , dynamic public art work , " said Mr. Poussin . <p> But the spaces also come with inherent challenges . Because the Gardiner underpass has long been a place of refuge for the homeless population , Mr. Poussin was encouraged to incorporate light into his work so that the condo 's security guard could easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his work and Watertable were required to be fully removable to ensure that city engineers could have full access for highway maintenance and repairs . Watertable is currently in storage while the underside of the Gardiner is being painted . <p> But there are also psychological hurdles at play when it comes to enticing people to rethink such unappealing space . <p> Mr. Smallenberg insists that the air around Underpass Park will be no more polluted than any other Toronto street corner , but said that drastic landscaping and lighting measures will have to be taken before people will accept it as a place to walk at night . <p> The park is scheduled for completion by this fall , and its designer insists that people will be happily surprised by the result . <p> " It 's a space that does have a lot of promise , " said Mr. Smallenberg . " There 's a lot of spaces that do n't have any promise at all . " 
@@4065232 <h> Michael Lista , On Poetry : Why literary magazines should fold <p> When Minister of Canadian Heritage James Moore announced the creation of the Canadian Periodical Fund , literary magazines in this country knew they were in trouble . The CPF is the consolidation of the Canadian Magazine Fund and the Publishing Assistance Program , two essential sources of subsidy for Canadian literary journals , and its stated goal is to help non-daily print publications " overcome market disadvantages . " It differs from its constituent parts in one key way : Only magazines with a yearly circulation of 5,000 copies or more are now eligible for funding , a benchmark the majority of literary journals do n't meet . <p> Last September , the first beneficiaries of the CPF were announced . Four hundred and eighty four magazines received a total of $52.7-million . Six literary magazines -- The Literary Review of Canada , Broken Pencil , Matrix , Prairie Fire , The Queen 's Quarterly and SubTerrain -- received $126,000 to split between them ( last year , under the old programs , 11 journals divvied up $219,000 ) . Put another way , literary magazines were awarded 0.02% of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazines received more than $1-million each ; the French and English versions of Chatelaine banked $1.2-million apiece . The list of recipients is worth a look : Anna Make Everyday Special , Motorcycle Mojo , On-Site Heavy Construction News , Penguin Eggs , The Eastern Synod Lutheran and V-8 Passion -- which one can only assume is the organ of commentary for vegetable cocktail aficionados -- all received funding through the CPF . More Christian magazines than literary magazines received subsidy . One of them , the Catholic Register , was $77 short of receiving half a million taxpayer dollars . <p> But will literary journals go broke ? And what does it mean to our poetry if they do ? <p> As I write this column , no journal has yet folded because of the CPF funding changes , but many are facing catastrophic budget shortfalls , some as large as 50% . Some journals , such as Taddle Creek , are raising prices to balance their books . Others , like Canadian Notes and Queries , are reducing their page counts . A handful in Ontario , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ontario Arts Council , and a few , like The Malahat Review , may be buttressed by the universities with which they are associated . <p> But some are going to fold . And while that may be a bad thing for the affected literary journals -- and their brave staff who work tirelessly and often thanklessly at their tasks -- it may not be a bad thing for our literature . It may well be that the " market disadvantage " plaguing their sector , a market disadvantage that the CPF is set on correcting , can only be reversed by the culling of a supersaturated market . <p> There are , by my count , some three dozen literary journals in Canada . But that was n't always the case . Canadian literary journals as we know them today are the grandchildren of early modernist magazines like The McGill Fortnightly Review and The Canadian Mercury , both of which published briefly in the 1920s . They were places where , for the first time , Canadian poets and prose writers could publish work , in their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before them , Canadian writers could only publish in foreign journals . They were always small and underfunded , but unlike , say , The Eastern Synod Lutheran , they punched well above their weight , and have made a cultural impact vastly disproportionate to their modest circulations . The cultural nationalism of the 1960s saw a boom in Canadian literary journals and today the bumper crop is so vast than even the most ravenous consumers of CanLit can never hope to digest a fraction of what 's on offer . <p> The problem with the market for literary journals now is that there 's too much supply for too little demand . The demand is there , to be sure , and is n't in danger of diminishment should a number of these journals fold ; quite the opposite . A culling will improve quality on both sides of the editorial table ; the quality of submissions will increase as places to publish become more scarce , as will the calibre of the editors . And if we move from having a couple dozen journals to a handful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the remaining organs . The standard of the whole enterprise will rise . A magazine 's most important asset , let 's keep in mind , is its exclusivity ; writers want to be published by magazines that are tough to get into , and readers buy pedigree . Plus , this sort of consolidation will put the literary journals that remain in a better position to receive significant funding through the CPF , which allocates funds according to circulation . And all of this will produce a couple robust magazines -- Canadian versions of Poetry or The Paris Review -- that are more exportable , that the foreign reader curious about our literature can buy for a comprehensive , concise survey of our very best and freshest work . <p> I like what Christian Wiman wrote in his essay " In Praise of Rareness " : " Institutionalized efforts at actually encouraging the overconsumption of poetry always seem a bit freakish , ill-conceived , and peculiarly American , like those mythic truck stops where anyone who can eat his own weight in rump roast does n't have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

But while the Canada Line whisks hundreds of passengers a day to their destinations , hundreds more huddle at bus stops or fume in their cars . <p> Transit is a hit-and-miss affair in the Lower Mainland , with some neighbourhoods well-served and others out of the loop . <p> The skyline of Calgary , AB at sunrise on Tuesday , September 02 , 2010 . Chris Bolin for The Globe and Mail <h> Slideshow <h> Multimedia <h> infographic <p> The patchy coverage reflects geography , history and financial constraints .

Modes of transit include buses , the SkyTrain light rapid transit system , a SeaBus that links the North Shore to downtown and the West Coast Express , a weekday commuter rail service between Vancouver and Mission . In addition , TransLink shares responsibility for major roads and bridges with local governments . <p> Over the past few decades , the region 's population has outpaced transit development . Major new projects have been few and far between . SkyTrain debuted for Expo 86 . The proposed Evergreen Line - a $1.4-billion SkyTrain extension that would link Coquitlam to Vancouver - has been on the drawing board since the 1990s , but has stalled repeatedly over money problems . South of the Fraser River , cities like Surrey , Delta and Langley are forecast to have some of the biggest population increases in the region over the next 30 years but at this point argue that they have n't seen their share of transit cash , or service . <p> Last year , TransLink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have relied on property tax increases to fund several major projects , including the Evergreen Line . <p> Provincial and federal dollars for the project have been lined up but TransLink still needs to come up with its $400-million share of the tab . <p> " The supplemental plan did n't go anywhere because their ' plan ' was to put more of a burden on property taxes , " says West Vancouver mayor Pamela Goldsmith-Jones , who is vice-chair of the mayors ' council . " And we as mayors have been very clear that is not tenable . " <p> The province and mayors in 2010 signed a memorandum of understanding that both sides would look at " all options " for future transit funding . TransLink 's current revenue sources include property , fuel and parking taxes . The agency also has the authority to impose a vehicle levy and an " area benefiting tax " - a levy that would be paid from property owners that stand to benefit from transit improvements . <p> TransLink 's funding bind has been an issue for more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It has n't gone away - it has gotten worse . And the delegated funding sources that TransLink was given are not enough to sustain the plan , " he says . <p> In the meantime , urban planning in Port Coquitlam , Port Moody and Coquitlam has been based on the belief that " some day the train will come " - a belief that is at times difficult to maintain . <p> " Business wants certainty . Investment in our sector is suffering because of skepticism about rapid transit , " Mr. Trasolini says . " Business suffers when you do n't have efficient transportation systems and you have things left in the air without any certainty . " <p> Future fixes <p> For transportation planners , big sports or cultural events can be virtual laboratories , ripe with possibilities for experiments and innovation . <p> After monitoring transportation and travel patterns in Vancouver during the 2010 Olympic games , Tarek Sayed has one overriding conclusion . <p> " We can set the bar much higher than what we are doing right now , " says Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city , that dispatched squads of University of British Columbia student survey teams to monitor people coming in to or leaving downtown . " We can expect a larger per cent shift in sustainable modes , including transit . " <p> The study found that trips by " sustainable " modes - transit , walk or bike - more than doubled during the games and accounted for 79.5 per cent of spectator travel to event venues . <p> Faced with the closure of major roadways into downtown , people adjusted - walking , taking the bus or working from home . That adjustment holds lessons , including the potential to use a " carrot and stick " approach to transit and travel planning , says Mr. Sayed . <p> A " carrot " might be a speedy new transit line , while a stick could be costly parking fees or road closures - all designed to encourage " compact " living . <p> In Vancouver , planners are weighing proposals for higher-density developments along the Cambie Corridor travelled by the Canada Line . Richmond , too , is pursuing transit-oriented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as electronic fare cards - names in the running for TransLink 's planned smart card include Tpass , Compass and Starfish , along the lines of London 's Oyster - and other changes that make transit more convenient and efficient , such as traffic systems that provide green lights for transit vehicles . <p> TransLink is trying to build on its Olympic legacy , which includes higher-than-forecast ridership for the Canada Line , with TravelSmart , a program that encourages people to use sustainable options to travel around the region . <p> Outside of Vancouver , that concept can be more difficult to embrace . <p> TransLink has boosted bus service in Surrey , but that 's not enough for many people to give up the convenience and comfort of their cars , says Surrey mayor Dianne Watts . <p> " That SkyTrain is called the Expo line because it was built for Expo , with four stops , " Ms. Watts says , referring to Surrey 's four SkyTrain stations .

South of the Fraser we are going to take 70 per cent of the region 's growth over the next 10 , 15 , 20 years - and there has to be infrastructure put in place . " <p> Ms. Watts , like many of her counterparts , says TransLink needs a different funding mechanism that would allow the agency to put together an integrated , long-term plan . <p> For Surrey , she favours a light rail systems that would link different " nodes " of Surrey to SkyTrain network . <p> SkyTrain is great for linking two urban centres but is far too expensive to run through sprawling Surrey , she says .

For author Denise Johnson , the lottery has nothing to do with the riches of monetary wealth . The woman , who has gained some local fame as a gifted tarot reader and channeller , is a firm believer in the freeing potential of meditation . <p> According to Johnson ( who has published her book under the spiritual name Clarity Jigme Kunga ) , the ability to exist " in the now " is a gift that needs to be cherished and shared . <p> Bringing more people to experience peace within themselves is the purpose of her writing , in which she describes how Shamantha meditation has brought her through unbelievable amounts of physical suffering as well as emotional turmoil . The word refers to concentration , being a single point focus meditation where all distracting thoughts are sent away with the out breath . <p> Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years , arriving aboard the Mystic Star from Cortez Island with her partner and three children . The family meant to stay for just two weeks , but after a series of mechanical failures they figured maybe the universe was trying to tell them something . <p> Johnson has learned to listen closely to such cues in recent years -- the past decade has brought incredible health challenges , a near-death experience , a coma and an eventual journey into healing . Guiding her path have been some interesting figures , who do n't all exist on the terrestrial plane . <p> Johnson began her meditation practice as a single mother in Nova Scotia . Her family was originally Roman Catholic , and her mother watched with suspicion when a Buddhist monastery came into the area where she was born and raised in francophone Cape Breton . But after starting out as an interested , if bemused , observer herself , Johnson was drawn to meditation class . <p> " I did n't have to do anything -- I did n't have to think or worry . And it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry about losing control of my life , " Johnson recalled , describing the class as a chance to " gap out . " <p> In 1998 , Johnson had a bizarre dream that preceded a whole string of equally bizarre coincidences centering on Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche , a former monk from Tibet who founded a series of Shambala Meditation Centres throughout North America as well as the first accredited Buddhist university in the west . <p> As she explains In How to Win the Lottery , " I was 28 years old , a single mother on welfare when we met . I was dreaming , and he was dead . " In fact , Trungpa had been dead for 11 years and Johnson had never heard of him . <p> Circumstances would lead to Johnson finding more and more connections between her life and the Rinpoche while she was in Nova Scotia , and she believes she continues to meet people he has directed toward her to this day . <p> " Just when you think ' this is so weird , ' it just keeps getting weirder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to suspend judgement about it . " <p> Johnson embraced the teachings of Trungpa . After she met her partner Rory and had two more children with him , her family practised meditation together and embarked on a Buddhist-oriented home school program . They decided to move to B.C. shortly after taking the formal Refuge Vow . <p> " With three young children and a picture of The Karmapa glued to the dashboard , we set out to find health and happiness on Canada 's west coast , " Johnson writes . <p> " However , within three months of arrival in British Columbia , I was diagnosed with third stage uterine cancer . " <p> The events that followed would have finished off most people . Johnson flat-lined after her first surgery and and then did n't stop bleeding when she was sent home from the hospital . <p> Soon after she had a hysterectomy , an allergic reaction to pain medication and an infection , and went into a coma for three weeks . She underwent a full experience of being in the " white light " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her family . Through all of it she practised Shamantha . <p> " I did natural childbirth , and post-op without pain relief was like birthing a baby every five minutes . It just did n't stop , " Johnson said . Entering the coma relieved not only the physical pain but also the mind , with no thoughts disturbing her for three weeks . <p> While Johnson came to her own clarity through the path of Buddhist teaching , she does not feel any faith has a monopoly on understanding . Indeed , she said the beauty of meditation is that the practitioner need not adhere to any belief system . <p> During her near-death experience , Johnson also received knowledge that she should be acting as a medium to help people find clarity and connect with the world of spirit . In another bizarre occurrence , requests for such readings started coming in to the family 's unlisted cell phone before she had even come out of the coma . Clairvoyant readings are now her primary work . <p> Johnson said she receives information directly from " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without embellishment to her clients , but in fact , nothing is told that they do n't already know . <p> " The purpose of the reading is to validate . Your spirit is connected to the universal mind/spirit , " Johnson explained . <p> " We 're always looking for understanding . If one hamster has stopped running the wheel for just a moment , that energy can be kept in yourself . " <p> Johnson 's purpose now is to pay back the kindness she has received from people in the physical and spiritual realms , both with her readings and by teaching people about meditation . And despite her lengthy health battle , which she is still recovering from five years later , she said she would n't change the experience . <p> " There 's still bills , still stress , still kids with the flu -- but there are still moments that are miraculous , " Johnson said .

@@4065238 <p> As Japan digs for its dead , copes with hundreds of thousands of homeless , and races to cool down its stricken reactors , the world is having a meltdown over nuclear power . <p> And , with climate change bearing down on the planet , everyone 's wondering what the energy future will be . <p> Coal 's too dirty , hydro ca n't meet all our needs , power from wind and solar is intermittent , and oil ? Well , the world just keeps going to war over that . <p> Which is why the idea of thorium-based reactors has exploded into the nuclear debate . <p> This radioactive metal is increasingly being touted as The Answer . <p> " Here 's a solution that 's in front of us that can solve multiple problems , " says retired physicist and IT specialist Robert Hargraves . " It can tackle global warming . To the extent that we can make fuel , we can reduce our dependency on the Mideast . " <p> Brief chemistry refresher course : atomic number 90 , symbol Th , just two protons fewer than uranium , and four fewer than plutonium , shiny , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal was discovered in 1828 and named for Thor , the Norse god of thunder . <p> Thorium 's fans -- nuclear scientists and engineers , chemists and physicists , even some environmentalists -- have become almost cult-like in their promotion of thorium as the solution to most of the world 's energy problems . <p> They say that , among other things , a well-designed thorium-fuelled plant beats the uranium-based system on all fronts . <p> For one thing , there 's enough easily mined thorium in the ground to power the world for a thousand years . According to the U.S. Geological Survey , the United States has an estimated 440,000 tonnes , Australia and India about 300,000 tonnes each , and Canada about 100,000 tonnes . <p> It 's supposedly safer and produces much less waste . The waste it does produce loses its radiotoxicity in about 300 years , as opposed to tens or hundreds of thousands for conventional uranium waste . <p> Plus , get this , it actually feeds on radioactive plutonium waste , one of the nastiest substances on earth , as part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disposal of plutonium is probably the nuclear industry 's most vexing problem . <p> Although there are no thorium reactors currently in operation , they have worked in the past , in both the U.S. and the former Soviet Union . Right now China and India are developing them . <p> According to their proponents , liquid fluoride thorium reactors ( LFTRs ) would be much smaller in scale than the nuclear plants in Pickering and Darlington , and would be resistant to what scientists refer to as proliferation -- the manufacture of nuclear weapons . <p> Interest in thorium has intensified so much that a previously esoteric website called Energy From Thorium ( http : //energyfromthorium.com/ ) has been crashing . Its host and creator , Kirk Sorenson , an Alabama-based NASA veteran , nuclear technologist and aerospace engineer , has had to apologize to his growing number of Facebook followers for server crashes . <p> So besieged is he with requests for interviews about thorium -- whose cult-like following says one tonne of it produces as much energy as 200 tonnes of uranium or 3,500,000 tonnes of coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ca n't talk before this story 's deadline . <p> But he does tell the forward-looking U.S. magazine Fast Company that , had Japan built LFTRs or molten salt reactors ( MSRs ) with thorium instead of the more common and conventional uranium-based light water reactors ( LWRs ) , nobody would be looking at their Japanese-sourced foodstuffs suspiciously today . <p> " A major problem at Fukushima was that the tsunami knocked out the emergency power system that was supposed to pump water through the plant to keep it cool , " Sorensen said . <p> He says LFTR designs automatically shut themselves down , even if emergency power is lost . What 's more , they probably never would have reached a dangerous melting point -- at least 1,400 degrees Celsius -- to begin with . <p> Explains Ottawa-based physicist David Leblanc , whose company Ottawa Valley Research Associates is developing a new generation of MSRs : " We have nothing to push the radioactive material out . We 've got nothing that explodes . We 've got no pressure . We 've got no steam . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could then explode . <p> " There 's nothing to go boom , so to speak . " <p> All of which helps explain why thorium has gone nuclear this month . <p> From a few Twitter mentions a week to several thousand a day . Coverage on every major scientific website , as well as pieces in London 's Daily Telegraph and The Wall Street Journal . All of them singing the praises of this humble and largely anonymous element . <p> Hargraves is author of the booklet " AIM High , " which attempts to demonstrate that not only can LFTRs be cleaner and greener , they probably could be built on assembly lines , one a day , like Boeing airliners , and sited in places where electricity is currently unaffordable . <p> " My motivation is years of frustration listening to people complain about high energy prices , or wars in the Mideast , our energy dependence and now global warming -- and not taking action with an effective solution , " he says on the phone from his home in Hanover , Maine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> " Meltdown just does n't happen , " insists Leblanc . " All of us , especially since Japan , have been doing a lot of what ifs ? What if we had a tsunami ? What if we had floods ? What if we had a meteor strike ? It 's just really hard for any of us to imagine any kind of danger to the public . It 's really hard to imagine any mess getting beyond the plant gate . " <p> Thorium pitches are really just " appeals for public funding , " he says : " Thorium reactors are only one of a significant number of long-term dreams to plant soybeans in Antarctica with the help of nuclear sun lamps . There is almost no limit to the dreams you can have with an endless , too-cheap-to-meter source of clean , benign , **28;176;TOOLONG energy . " <p> Needless to say , Rubin is not impressed . Not just with LFTRs , but with nuclear power plants in general . <p> " Thorium does n't eliminate the problems , " he contends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then switching to thorium might solve their problem . But that 's not their problem . The fuel cost in today 's reactors is a tiny fraction of the total cost . That 's not what is giving the Ontario government sticker shock about the next two reactors at Darlington . They 're solving a non-problem by substituting a cheaper fuel for uranium . Unless they solve the big problems , they 've got a curiosity there instead of a practical solution to anybody 's problems . " <p> But if , as proponents say , the thorium fuel cycle is so fantastic , why did the world go with uranium ? <p> Long story very short and simple : In the 1950s , in the Cold War-obsessed U.S. , there was essentially a competition between uranium- and thorium-based systems . It was determined that the former , used in a light water reactor , was the quickest and easiest way to power a nuclear submarine . The bonus was that the waste from the LWR process could be used to make bombs . And so Washington went with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee was mothballed . <p> But it was n't because the experiment was a bust . It ran incident-free for five years . <p> Now , India and China are pursuing thorium-based reactors . <p> So what 's stopping us now ? <p> " The downside is it 's disruptive to the whole industry , " says Hargraves . " It 's going to cost $2 billion to build the first one and get it started . There is more engineering to be done . " <p> To complicate matters , most nuclear engineers today have never learned about MSRs . They dropped out of nuclear texts decades ago . There 's virtually no mention of thorium on Industry Canada 's website . Atomic Energy Canada Limited , despite a recent agreement with China on using thorium in its Candu reactors , does n't seem to be much invested in LFTRs . And although the Oak Ridge blueprints could easily be dusted off and used as a starting point , the financial exposure is huge . <p> " No matter how good our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to develop ; anything nuclear is , " says Leblanc . " There are huge potential rewards but there are some pretty major costs as well . And that 's really hard to get people to work on . " <p> " Yes , we know that wind and solar can provide electricity , but we also know it ca n't be the real solution , " says Leblanc .

But women should n't become complacent in fighting for change . <p> In 1989 , in my first year of teaching at Ryerson School of Journalism , Mary Lynn Young was a smart , hard-working student in my first-year news reporting class . <p> In the years following , Young went on to work as a crime reporter , business columnist and editor at major daily newspapers in Canada and the United States . She then decided to return to academic studies , and in 2005 , completed a PhD with a dissertation examining media coverage of crime and gender . <p> Today , Young is director of the University of British Columbia 's Graduate School of Journalism . This week , she released the Canadian results of a groundbreaking global report on women in media conducted by the Washington-based International Women 's Media Foundation . <p> Young labels some aspects of this report as " disappointing . " But the report also strongly indicates to me that Canadian women have come a long way since the days when Young was an ambitious Ryerson journalism student and a woman had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-level roles in journalism . <p> Full disclosure : Young has remained a friend over these past two decades . Now she 's the " teacher " and I continually learn much from her research commitment to issues that matter in newsrooms . <p> Young , along with Alison Beale , professor and director of the Simon Fraser University School of Communication , directed Canadian research for the Global Report of the Status of Women in the News Media . This study , the first of its kind , examined women in journalism in 59 nations . Canadian researchers looked at 11 media institutions in 2009 . The Star was one of five Canadian newspapers that provided data . <p> Coincidentally , the report was issued a day after I returned to Ryerson to participate in an inspiring symposium on women in journalism initiated by current j-school students seeking information and guidance about the path ahead , given the reality that women now far outnumber men in journalism schools across Canada . <p> No one could argue that there are no issues of major concern for women in Canadian journalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in salary advancement , and balancing work and family .

Still , I see much to celebrate in this new report . <p> Overall , the study shows that Canadian women are close to achieving parity with men in terms of numbers working full time in journalism . Among 59 countries , Canada stands out as a nation making great strides for women . <p> " On the whole , there is fairly strong evidence of commitment to gender equity in the Canadian news companies surveyed .

@@4067236 <h> Canada 's first social media election is on , but will people vote ? Add to ... <p> Are 140 characters enough to make or break a federal election campaign ? <p> Canadians are about to find out . <p> The defeat of the Conservative government unleashed a torrent of political tweets . By midafternoon Sunday , more than 14,000 tweets had been sent out during the first day-and-a-half of the campaign related to the election or Canadian politics . With a potential reach of more 16 million people , it was a dramatic spike from the less than 2,000 tweets on the same topics the weekend before . <h> Interactive <p> If there was ever a question before , it 's clear now : Canada 's first social media election is under way . <p> The raw commentary on Twitter is often anonymous and occasionally obscene . For parties with the proper tracking software , what potential voters say on social media can provide real-time feedback on the campaign to find out what 's working and what is n't . <p> " That kind of information , to me , would be golden for a campaign , " said Mark Blevis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the above-mentioned statistics to The Globe and Mail . <p> At a high level , Mr. Blevis said , tracking Twitter lets campaigns know what issues are resonating with voters . But parties could also drill down deeper and reach out to potential supporters . <p> The revolution <p> Barack Obama 's 2008 presidential campaign is seen as the watershed moment for social media in politics . Mr. Obama 's team used the online tools to make their candidate more relatable , while at the same time organizing local online groups with the goal of identifying people who would then be more physically engaged in the campaign by volunteering or donating money . <p> New Calgary Mayor Naheed Nenshi also won praise for using social media in the right ways - being genuine and responsive online rather than simply spewing news releases . <p> Mr. Nenshi 's chief of staff Chima Nkemdirim said personal responses online from the candidate and an openness to critical feedback on policy issues are what worked last year . <p> " There was a good chance he 'd actually tweet you back , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manager . " From the early signs , I do n't see any of the federalparties using social media the way we used it in Calgary . " <p> Conservative MPs increasingly took to Twitter over the past year - a loosening of the tight message control the party is known for under Leader Stephen Harper . <p> It 's no secret that Twitter feeds from politicians like Tony Clement are must-reads for journalists and political junkies . The former industry minister is famously known for tweeting government policy - such as overturning a CRTC decision on usage-based billing on the Internet . <p> There are an estimated 17 million Canadians on Facebook , but fewer than five million on Twitter . The might of Facebook - particularly as it grows in popularity with older Canadians - means parties must ensure their sites are current and engaging .

That means that the standard community-centre gatherings that take place in the evenings for a few hundred local residents will now be available live online to all . Both parties say they also plan to have the leaders answer online comments in these and other forums . <p> Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff is also expected to post regular blogs . So far , however , all three leaders appear to be ignoring the advice of social media experts by issuing tweets in the tone of press releases rather than casual conversation . <p> The parties will certainly be tracking the tweets of the various candidates and their staffers , ready to pounce at the first sign of a slip-up . <p> " You have a brain wave and bang : it 's out there in the public domain , " said Tom Flanagan , who has directed past Conservative campaigns in which candidates were urged not to blog in order to stay out of trouble . " I see it as a problem , but Twitteris so new , it has n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is there 's only 140 characters , so there 's perhaps a limited amount of damage you can do saying something stupid on Twitter . " <p> Does it work ? <p> Dr. Anatoliy Gruzd , the founder of the social media lab at Dalhousie University , said the emerging Twitter tracking software is clearly of use to parties . While still in its infancy , he said , the data can provide real-time feedback , complementing traditional public-opinion polling . <p> " There are so many people using these tools and it 's real-time , " he said . <p> The professor will also be watching to see if Canadian parties learned the lessons of recent election campaigns in Canada and the United States . Efforts to engage voters by having them make their own YouTube ads or other interactive efforts are far better than simply sending out one-way messages , he said . <p> Nonetheless , a fundamental unknown remains . Does the politician who has the most Facebook friends , the highest Twitter score or the most iPhone app downloads necessarily mean more people will put down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The results of last fall 's U.S. midterm elections suggest yes . The site All Facebook reported that in 74 per cent of House of Representative races and 81 per cent of Senate races , a candidate 's Facebook fan count was an accurate predictor of victory . <p> Will the same pattern play out in Canada ? Mr. Blevin thinks social media may swing a few ridings . Dr. Gruzd said he will be watching to see if social media persuades Canadians to vote .

@@4067239 <p> Most people misinterpret my love for sports as one constituting the same nerdy idolization frequently observed in sports fans . No -- I like sports because it affords me the necessary social atmosphere to get piss-liquored and shout at people without the cops being called . But the world of the Bell Centre stands in harsh contrast to my most beloved of pursuits , and pretty much ban thes inebriation of this struggling McGill proletarian . <p> So , largely because I wanted to see a live hockey game and could n't afford to buy tickets to one , I convinced my editor to score a media pass to the Sabres vs . Canadiens game this past Tuesday . Two teams fighting for their playoff lives . And boy was I treated to the works . <p> The media section is filled with two things : humpty-dumpty male sports writers -- basically a pack of ticks Hunter S. Thompson lovingly compared to " pimps and real estate agents " -- and stereotypically attractive female sports writers , who , from what I could tell , kept most of the other group of miscreants pretty happy . It was an odd contrast that seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weird iron oval media section that hung apart from the rest of the stadium . <p> There were free hot dogs , chips , and coffee -- evidently a popular diet . I took my place at my media position beside a pretty serious dude who seemed to care about the fate of the Sabres . I was immediately suspicious of this odd man . <p> When the game started the Canadiens played some serious propaganda . They displayed a video montage of children playing hockey , dreaming of one day becoming players like the Canadiens , then they showed the childhood amateur hockey cards of current Canadiens . <p> The message was palpable : one day this could be you . <p> But I wonder -- when most of these professional players were young , precocious , and dreaming wild dreams of becoming NHLers -- could their parents have even afforded to take them to an NHL game ? Maybe then , but not now . Not at an average ticket price of $86.44 . <p> The rising costs of sports games <p> In the past fifteen years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and has also gone up about $30 in the past five years alone . And that number is misleadingly deflated . In 2000-2001 , Team Marketing Research -- the company that compiles this data every year -- dubiously decided to factor out " Premium Seating " . In the 2000-2001 season , the average ticket price for the Colorado Avalanche dropped from $63.11 to $37.36 following their Stanley Cup-winning season . It would be naive to think it was out of appreciation for their fans instead of some manipulative accounting . <p> In a culture where fans are so deeply devoted to their team , particularly in a city like Montreal , they would pay almost any price for tickets and sell off their first-born child in the process . The Bell Centre has a sell-out streak that dates back to January 2004 , despite the astronomical jump in costs . <p> " In Montreal , hockey is a religion , " said Joe Dimauro , a Montreal-based ticket reseller . " It 's simple economics : The more people want it , they 're willing to pay for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are getting away with ... asking for higher prices . " <p> Yet Dimauro , as a ticket reseller , represents another element in today 's modern sports entertainment industry that is pricing out working-class fans . Today , many fans turn to ticket resellers and , as a result , have to pay well above face value for their tickets . Dimauro estimated that he charges between 25 and 30 per cent above face value , but clarified that everything is based on market conditions . <p> " Let 's say the season-ticket holder -- their ticket cost them $300 . If the market is strong and they decide to sell it to the reseller , me , for $600 ... I have to resell it for $700-800 . It all depends on the market , " said Dimauro . But if Dimauro sees that the tickets are being sold for more money , he will adjust his price . " If ... I see everybody selling tickets at roughly $1,000 each , that 's what I 'm going to do ... I 'm going to be selling at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ticket . " <p> It is obvious that ticket resellers -- who in essence are licensed scalpers -- are part of the reason that the games have gotten to the point of simply being unaffordable for many fans . Yet the problem has gotten worse . Dimauro states that in the past 15 years , the internet has been the prime factor in the changes that the reselling industry has experienced . In the past , reselling mostly happened on the street outside the arena , through private ads in newspapers , or through word of mouth . Today , the reselling industry 's main platform is the internet , and this has allowed more people to resell their tickets for profit . " There are more players on the market , " said Dimauro . " Because of the internet , you have more wannabe ticket resellers . ... You could get your hands on tickets , put an ad on craigslist , and sell the tickets and make a profit . " <p> Danny Antoinette , a fan at last week 's Canadiens game , came with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limiting his cost to one ticket at $180 . But what happens when he 's all grown up , playing hockey with his own childhood amateur hockey card ? <p> " When I was a kid my Dad used to take me to the Old Forum in the stand-up section , " Antoinette said . " Tickets were like $20 to 30 for the two of us . That 's out of the question nowadays . " <p> Fans getting shut out <p> Modern sports franchises , which largely employ players coming from the working classes of society and profit from their prolific skills , oddly alienate the common person from purchasing tickets to see their peers play . The paradox is evident . Pro sports were once a bastion for the working man -- a place that they could retreat to for entertainment , to avoid the reality of things like war and the Great Depression . Yet since the 2008 recession , the average ticket price in the NHL has gone up each year . Dimauro believes that sports is a recession-proof industry . " In some respects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because people need an out for their depression . " <p> As I sat back in my big-shot media chair I could see eye-to-eye with the nose-bleed fan base . They were all standing joyously , shouting and chanting at the players far down below , densely packed together in some sort of workers ' commune . No seat was bare . No person silent . <p> Below I could see bare patches of seats in the lower bowl . <p> " There 's a good reason for that , " said Dimauro . " In the upper levels ... seats are cheaper . Most people in the general public can afford the cheaper seats and not the expensive seats . " <p> But , because of ticket resellers , getting upper-level tickets is not so easy . " If you can get the upper level seats , they 're affordable -- $40 to 50 -- but good luck trying to get them , " said Antoinette . " You got to buy them online and they 're all season tickets and it 's very , very hard to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't get them . " <p> The fact that the lower levels are often empty is just a technicality for the Canadiens and their illustrious sell-out streak . All of the tickets are still sold , but whether or not people go is another issue . " It 's not a problem as far as the Bell Centre or the Montreal Canadiens hockey club is concerned because they sold all of their tickets , " said Dimauro . On Tuesday night , Dimauro claimed that many resellers were stuck with the tickets they were unable to sell , but the Canadiens still reported a sell-out crowd . " Whether people go and sit in those seats is inconsequential to the owners of the team . " <p> In the current market , the Canadiens are selling out their tickets , the resellers are making profits on tickets they get , and the fans are getting righteously screwed . " It 's an open market , " said Dimauro . " We live in a free and open democratic society whether you 're a scalper or ... anybody else . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all buy tickets , we can all do what we want with them , and that 's the bottom line . " But the fans , in essence , are getting punished for their avid support . Owners and resellers recognize that fans will pay high prices to see their beloved teams in action and , because of that , they charge prices that are almost unfathomable . The whole thing is a deal with the devil and the devil is paying your favourite hockey player . <p> In the press box <p> The odd man beside me writing feverishly about the Sabres groaned and scowled at the upper section as whistles flew down to the referee . Another penalty against the Canadiens had been called . This was after all a hockey game , not church , so I broke the silence . <p> " Bad call , eh ?

" <p> With the first wave of baby boomers turning 65 this year , and many Canadians still reeling from having much of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are top of mind for many voters . <p> Elana Sarson , 23 , said she has already started contributing to her workplace pension and a private retirement plan . <p> " I 'm throwing things into a TFSA ( Tax-free Savings Account ) as quick as I can , " she said , because she does n't count on the Canada Pension Plan still existing when she 's ready to retire . <p> Sarson said she sees the pension issue as a " play for votes " targeted at baby boomers and is not satisfied that parties have explained how they will finance new benefits and increased savings options . <p> Pension reforms have garnered so much attention lately that Liberal MP Bob Rae will speak to the issue at a Toronto conference on Wednesday . The 2011 Summit on the Future of Pensions will also feature the Conference Board of Canada 's long-term economic outlook and the results of Towers Watson 's annual pension risk survey . <p> Meanwhile , federal NDP leader Jack Layton announced Monday that his party would gradually double the Canada and Quebec Pension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with personal savings . <p> " In this election , with one third of our workforce without any retirement savings at all , I 'm asking Canadians who they trust to fight for the pensions your family relies on , " Layton said in a statement . <p> He also promised to invest an additional $700 million annually in the Guaranteed Income Supplement . <p> The Liberals have echoed the promise to add $700 million to the GIS , and proposed gradually increasing defined CPP benefits and allowing for a new , voluntary supplement to the CPP , which the party is calling the Secure Retirement Option . <p> " Liberals are framing it somewhat differently ... in that they 're focusing on elder care and sick care and that 's the appeal they 're making , potentially , to boomers , " said University of Toronto politics expert Nelson Wiseman . <p> The Tories have so far stayed quiet about the pension issue on the hustings , after Quebec and Alberta stymied CPP expansion plans in December 2010 . Finance Minister Jim Flaherty 's pension reform would have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in order to fund a more generous pension regime . That plan was rejected , however , in favour of a scheme that would allow small businesses , workers and the self-employed to buy into a privately run pension pool . <p> A conservative spokesman referred the Star to the recently defeated budget document , which contains measures to add $300 million to the GIS and outlines a framework for defined contribution Pooled Registered Pension Plans ( PRPPs ) , the Conservatives ' preferred method . <p> But pensions are likely to continue popping up in campaign speeches , as politicians tailor their messages to appeal to the sandwich generation of middle aged professionals caring for young children and aging parents , often under the same roof . <p> " I think there are significant concerns regarding CPP and the ability to continue financing it , " says Sarson , who works in financial services in Toronto . " As baby boomers get older -- from a health care perspective , from a CPP perspective -- the cost of our services is going to go up . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to Statistics Canada . Currently , two out of every three Canadians have no workplace pensions and 1.6 million seniors are living on less than $15,000 a year in government support , said Eng . <p> Two-thirds of Canadians have not saved enough money to retire on , said Glen Hodgson , Senior Vice-President and Chief Economist with the Conference Board of Canada . <p> " There 's going to be ongoing pressure on our pensions , both public and private , as there are fewer and fewer of us working to support more and more pensioners , " he said . <p> Hodgson added the current investment climate is layered with risk due to high public sector debt , the effect of the Japan earthquake on global supply chains , inflation due to increasing energy and food prices , and political turbulence in North Africa . <p> He said pension fund earnings should improve this year , and interest rates are due to rise mid-year . <p> " There 's a reason why our finance ministers have been debating this over the last number of years and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table , " said Hodgson . " You can have a big debate about whether it 's public sector or private sector 's responsibility to fill that gap . " <p> Ontario 's finance minister , Dwight Duncan , has said he supports expansion of the CPP . Quebec moved toward implementing a voluntary contribution system last month , as finance minister Raymond Bachand tabled a budget that outlines major changes to the Quebec Pension Plan . <p> Eng said the majority of CARP members prefer a public solution : " It should be a defined benefit plan , it should be a universal enlarged plan and it should be run by the public sector . " <p> While pensions have attracted public and political attention , it 's unlikely the issue will change the way people vote , added Wiseman .

( Etienne Ranger ) <p> The glass-clad Constitution Square notwithstanding , many of the privately held structures date back to the ' 60s and ' 70s . While the architectural style of that era may have long fallen out of favour , the buildings generally continue to function and remain relatively full . <p> That is , until one makes it to the east end of Albert Street , at Elgin Street . <p> The government-owned seven-storey Lorne Building , formerly home to the National Gallery of Canada , was barely 48 years old when Public Works declared it beyond the point of no return and acknowledged it would have to be torn down . <p> Just prior to hitting the campaign trail , the Conservatives proposed a new policy that would help prevent such relatively rapid degradation of public assets . <p> Buried beneath the feel-good tax credits for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an important signal to businesses about their role in constructing the federal buildings of the future . <p> Under the plan , it would be mandatory for government departments to consider public-private partnerships for any infrastructure project with capital costs greater than $100 million that creates an asset with a lifespan of at least 20 years . <p> Despite the budget being dead on arrival and forgotten by many once the writs were dropped , Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said the document would be reintroduced by a Tory minority or majority government . <p> If another party assumes power following the May 2 vote , it would be a major and ill-guided reversal to reduce the growing role of the private sector in the construction of federal assets . <p> Granted , there is merit to the argument that the government is better off owning buildings outright when it intends to occupy a facility long-term . <p> But Public Works has been a poor caretaker of its office buildings in the National Capital Region in recent decades , consistently underinvesting in preventative maintenance . This results in early obsolescence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings prematurely . <p> While critics often decry the fact that businesses can make money under P3 arrangements , it is this possibility of profits that gives the private-sector partner the motivation the government seemingly lacks to maintain its buildings . <p> P3 contracts frequently require a building to perform to specified standards . The private partner only maximizes its profits when it invests in preventative maintenance , lest it become a costly repair job down the road . <p> The feds are currently dabbling with several P3 procurement models to erect three new office buildings in Gatineau , as well as to construct a new home for Canada 's cryptologic agency near Ogilvie and Blair roads . <p> And , back downtown on Elgin Street , Public Works is said to be close to awarding a contract to a private-sector proponent to design , construct , finance and manage a new office tower on the Lorne Building site . <p> The feds ' P3 momentum has been building in recent years .

But observers say that when P3s do go awry , it is frequently because of poorly structured agreements that fail to clearly define the parties ' roles and responsibilities . That was part of the problem at L'Esplanade Laurier , where the federal government -- poised to exercise an option to buy the property -- accused the building 's then-owner , Rosdev , of withholding services that ultimately eroded the value of the two 22-storey office towers . <p> But with explicit performance metrics , P3s allow the government to tap into private-sector expertise on an as-needed basis while reducing the financial liability to taxpayers . <p> Despite Ottawa 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assets , political candidates on the campaign trail should be discussing how best to build a better National Capital Region in a way that respects taxpayers and creates assets that last .

By Melanie Florence . ( 2010 , Toronto : James Lorimer &amp; Company . Softcover . Pp. 104. $9.95 . ISBN 978-1-55277-529-5 . ) <p> Melanie Florence , a writer who has published a wide variety of articles on Aboriginal people and issues , tackled the interesting and emotional story of Jordin Tootoo , the first Inuit to play in the NHL . Her first book , Jordin Tootoo , traced Tootoo 's journey from being coached by his dad on his first team in Rankin Inlet to his current role as an agitator for the Nashville Predators . <p> Written for juvenile readers , Florence described Tootoo 's growing up in Nunavut ( Nooh-na-voot ) , making it easy to understand for those unfamiliar with the Native Canadian experience . Similar to the structure of the Carly Adams book Queens of the Ice ( both were published by Lorimer ) , Florence used the text @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . Interestingly , Florence added to the mythology of the origins of hockey in one of those text boxes . She described a similar game played by the Mi'kmaq prior to the arrival of Europeans to North America , complete with animal bone skates , frozen apple pucks , and sticks made from hornbeam trees . <p> Overall , the book was focused on the development and determination of Jordin Tootoo to get from Rankin Inlet to the NHL . Throughout the book , the reader experienced the different stages of Tootoo 's evolution as a hockey player . Notable points from his career included : <p> The first rink in Rankin Inlet was made with spaghetti to keep it from cracking ; <p> Tootoo shares a distinction with current teammate Shea Weber -- opposing players were terrified of his slapshot ; <p> He played Bantam with a Native Canadian team , the Opaskwayak Cree Nation Blizzard ; <p> Tootoo was voted most popular player four years in a row with the Brandon Wheat Kings ; <p> In 2002 , he won the National Aboriginal Achievement Award ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his brother , Terence . <p> Although it was apparent that Tootoo worked hard to be able to realize his dream of playing in the NHL , sometimes it was incredibly difficult for him to continue advancing . During his time in juniors , Tootoo experienced anti-Aboriginal racism for the first time . He would get homesick , and moving south into larger cities was often a culture shock . <p> Ultimately , a singular tragic moment would have a tremendous affect on his life -- the suicide of his older brother Terence in 2002 . Emotional topics , such as suicide are not often discussed in juvenile literature . Florence handled these weighty topics with both a sensitivity and well as in the capacity of an educator , explaining their difficult nature without a preachy tone . <p> Most hockey fans are aware of Tootoo 's recent experience with the NHL / NHLPA substance abuse program for alcohol abuse . It was during this time that more people became aware of the story of Terence Tootoo and the tragic affects suicide has on those left behind . Jordin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of alcohol treatment centers and , if the book had been written later than it was , one can be sure Florence would have handled this situation with the tact she used in the rest of the book. * <p> Overall , Tootoo 's story was inspirational for both children and adults . He showed that despite setbacks and adversity , one can achieve their dreams with hard work . Nashville Predators ' fans will not be surprised that Tootoo was voted the most popular player with the Wheat Kings , as he is probably the most popular player skating for the Predators today . His recent return to the ice was celebrated in Nashville and Number 22 's jersey t-shirts are incredibly difficult to come by in the Pro Shop at Bridgestone Arena . <p> Rebecca Dobrinski <p> *I hope readers understand that I am not excusing Tootoo 's alcohol abuse problems , nor am I trying to justify them .

@@4080235 <p> Investors looking to buy $1 worth of value for the bargain price of around 60 cents might be able to find such a deal in the shares of Pinetree Capital Ltd . <p> Pinetree , a mutual fund-like company that invests in junior resource companies , recently has traded for about $3 a share , but has a net asset value of $5.01 , or the amount of money that would be returned to stockholders if its holding of resource stocks were liquidated , and all its liabilities repaid . <h> infographic <h> Market View <p> It is n't every day that investors can buy the equivalent of a $1 bill for only 60 cents . So the big question : Is Pinetree an intriguing value play mispriced by the market , or do the shares have drawbacks that justify a sizable haircut from net asset value ? <p> Getting an answer to this critical question is difficult . There are no analysts listed by Bloomberg as following the company , unusual on the Canadian market for a business with shareholders ' equity of about $800-million . <p> The company does n't have a big institutional following either , and is mainly owned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money manager with gold bug tendencies , is the only major institutional holder of any size in the stock , with 6.7 per cent , according to Bloomberg . <p> ' Very , Very Hot To Trot ' <p> Company director and spokesman Marshall Auerback attributes the discount to the ebb and flow of interest in junior exploration companies . In early 2007 , during the peak in the pre-crash mania for all things resources , the shares traded at a premium of more than twice net asset value . <p> " When people are really very , very hot to trot on resources , particularly the junior Canadian resources sector , they look at this company . ... The current discount ismore a gauge of investor psychology than anything else , " he contended . <p> In its structure , Pinetree resembles a closed-end mutual fund . It pools money from many investors to buy shares it deems attractive . But it has no obligation to allow shareholders to cash out at net asset value , as in a conventional mutual fund , hence it trades on the stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling activity of investors . <p> About 40 per cent of its investments are in junior precious metal explorers , the rest spread among companies looking for uranium , other metals , coal , and oil and gas , giving a diversified portfolio . Pinetree believes macro-economic trends , such as growth in emerging markets and disdain for the U.S. dollar , are driving a long-term-bull case for companies looking for these commodities . <p> A benefit of gaining exposure to junior resource stocks through Pinetree is that investors get access to its professional analysts , led by chairman Sheldon Inwentash , an attraction the company touts in its presentations . <p> Access to professional money management in the junior space should be a draw . No one would mistake these startup companies for blue-chip stocks , and they are one of the easiest market sectors for the unwary to be fleeced by dubious promoters . <p> Tax inefficiencies do n't seem to explain the discount . Half of Pinetree 's capital gains are subject to taxation , according to CFO Gerry Feldman . That makes it similar to what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same companies as Pinetree . <p> Then What Gives ? <p> One knock against any company that , like Pinetree , holds a big portfolio of stock investments , is that there is no guarantee of receiving current market prices if it sold positions . The shares of many juniors are thinly traded and prices would tank if a big holder tried to liquidate . <p> However , Pinetree does n't face pressures to liquidate because shareholders ca n't demand their money back . The company 's strategy is to hold juniors , hope they hit pay dirt , and then sell out to a takeover or to less risk adverse investors once the juniors graduate to the development stage . <p> Mr. Auerback says Pinetree accepts that some of its investments wo n't pan out , part of the risk of the sector , and is mindful of the liquidity problems , sometimes selling positions into market strength to be prudent . <p> A possible reason for the discount is the supersized bonus paid to Mr. Inwentash . He receives 10 per cent of the capital appreciation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $25-million . Mr. Auerback admits the payout is high by Canadian standards , but is " not egregiously outrageous " compared with Wall Street . Hot U.S. hedge fund managers often pocket 20-per-cent fees . <p> Pinetree has options and warrants outstanding that potentially could dilute existing shareholders . But all the securities have strike prices above the current market , making it difficult to assess how many will be exercised . <p> OSC Investigation <p> Pinetree and Mr. Inwentash also received a notice from the Ontario Securities Commission in late 2006 that they were facing an investigation into alleged manipulative and insider trading , another risk for investors . <p> The company believes the probe has ended , which would be a vindication . " We have n't heard anything from the Ontario Securities Commission " since 2006 , says Pinetree CFO Gerry Feldman . " Time is not your enemy here . " The OSC declined to comment . <p> One approach to Pinetree would be to make direct investments in the some of the junior companies it holds , based on the view that it has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock positions are listed on its website , and such direct buys would avoid the OSC baggage , dilution and Mr. Inwentash 's big fees . <p> But given that the juicy discount to net asset value may be excessive , another idea - for those willing to take the risk - would be to buy the stock , and sell if and when it moves to a premium . A premium would probably signal the end of the bull run for junior resource stocks and a time to run from this speculative sector . <h> Restrictions <p> All rights reserved .

It 's a brilliant movie that took the metaphor all the way to the extreme in a new and provoking way that forces you into seeing the underlying themes and it 's a textbook example of catching lightening in a bottle . The American remake was originally announced back in 2006 and immediately came to a halt after the 2007 shootings at Virginia Tech University . <p> The idea is that Americans would n't like the extreme nature of the film and it was even speculated that the teenagers would be from a detention system in what I suppose is a misguided way to try and justify the children on children violence .

It 's an absolutely perfect example of how Urban Horror should be handled where the physical haunted house is replaced by a state of mental isolation . It 's been quite some time since I 've seen both of the sequels to Candyman but I do remember them seeming extremely forced while abandoning everything that made the first film great . <p> That being said , talks about Candyman 4 surfaced back in 2004 but it appears that the boat sailed on a purposed budget of 25 million ( who really thought that was going to happen ? ) .

This is probably all for the best considering that this attempt was a shining example of how an original film with very little substance can be completely reimagined as a film with even less substance . <p> Remember when the Friday the 13th movies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directors decided to just completely dismiss any kind of characters whatsoever that are n't named Jason and the movies became all about the fantastic kills displayed on interchangeable and worthless characters . Was it fun ? Hell yeah it was fun , even if the movies themselves were n't good , a good time was had by all so how bout we do n't taint that image with something horrible . <p> Rosemary 's Baby Platinum Dunes originally planned to do this remake back in 2007 , but they have since abandoned the idea , hopefully because they realized that they are n't complete morons . Seriously , remaking this film would be a worse idea than eating food that was prepared and served by monkeys ( because they play with a lot of poop , you get the joke ) . Roman Polanski 's film is not only beautifully shot , but expertly acted and written with a tight script that really makes the viewer think for the entire running time that maybe , just maybe Rosemary may be losing her mind . Turns out of course that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miracle of child birth quickly goes from bad to worse . <p> It 's a metaphor that plays on every parents fear that not only may they be slipping away mentally , but their helpless child may also be in harm 's way . The stakes have never been higher and in a horror film , it ca n't possibly get any more engrossing than that . That however is the whole point , that the baby is actually the spawn of Satan and even though the absolute worst case scenario happened , there is still life to be lived . Could you imagine an audience now seeing a remake ? We all know what is going to happen and if that ending did n't unravel in the film , then what on earth could n't another ending be ? Would the baby come out normal and have Rosemary end up in a mental institution ? Would the baby kill Rosemary ? Would Rosemary eat the baby ? There is no way that you could satiate an audience that enjoyed this film , and it looks like for once , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theater .... with constant bitching . <p> Nice article ! I agree with most everything here , though I ca n't comment on the Battle Royal movie . I would n't mind a Rosemary 's Baby remake if they brought in the top people to make it . It would need to be an increadible movie to live up to the name . I do n't need any more Jason or Candyman movies . I can go watch the ones already out there any time I need to . <p> I think if they did Rosemary 's Baby with a different take on it , it could be a good remake . But again , I do n't really think it 's that great of a movie to begin with . <p> Same goes with Friday the 13th part II . I actually have an idea that I think would make for a great sequel mainly changing the setting from summer time at Crystal Lake to winter time . That 's never been done before and totally should . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

He sounds like an upper-crust British version of Henny Youngman , although his one-liners have more the acidity of Rodney Dangerfield with the surreal smarts of Steven Wright . <p> Carr delivers his zingers with machine-gun-like rapidity and invariably connects . And if you could n't get enough of Carr 's one-liners at a clip of three-a-minute in a 10-minute set at past Just for Laughs , you had best prepare yourself to split a gut with the news that the Brit wit will be bringing his 75-minute one-man show Laughter Therapy to the 2001 eiditon of the summer fest , July 21 to 30 , at 9:30 p.m. at the Ges ?

@@4114236 <h> Life <h> Internal organs next commodity boom ? <p> Are Canada 's donor organs and its renowned transplant experts commodities the whole world should have access to -- or a precious resource for residents only ? Several hospitals are trying to answer that question as they field a steady stream of requests from patients in Middle Eastern and other countries where life-saving transplant services are nonexistent or limited . <p> At least one hospital -- Toronto General -- is already performing a handful of transplants a year for foreigners who supply their own donor and pay the full cost , and is considering whether to significantly expand the service . Surgeons in Edmonton get several requests a week for a pancreatic " islet " transplant procedure to treat diabetics , while other centres transplant kidneys to refugee claimants , some of whom have later been denied status and deported . <p> The issue is creating a stir in the medical world . A newly published paper by two Toronto ethicists suggests Canada develop national or provincial guidelines on transplants for foreign nationals , while the Canadian Society of Transplantation attempted to tackle the issues at a conference last summer . <p> " Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it internationally ? " asked Dr. Gary Levy , head of the University Health Network ( UHN ) multi-organ transplant program in Toronto . " I believe as a doctor my role is to save lives and , if the government of Ontario and the people of Ontario will allow me to do so and we have the ability to do it , I do n't see why restrictions should be at a border . " <p> The UHN routinely gets requests -- like one Dr. Levy fielded last week -- from doctors or patients in places such as Israel , Saudi Arabia and Bahrain to have Toronto General conduct liver and other transplants for patients who come with their own living donor . <p> The hospital , a world leader in liver and lung transplants , performs up to about five a year now , but hospital administrators are considering whether to expand the service to meet more of the demand , which would probably triple the current number , he said . <p> The foreign patient pays the full cost -- estimated by one doctor at about $100,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the hospital has enough transplant surgeons and other specialized staff and O.R . time available to accommodate the foreigners without cancelling or delaying any procedures for Canadians , said Dr. Levy . <p> Still , he is careful to ensure that the living donor is a relative or otherwise acting altruistically , given the well-documented organ trade in some developing countries . One patient from the Philippines was rejected because of such concerns , said Dr. Levy . <p> " We have to make sure we 're not involved in illegal activities , " he said . <p> The University of Alberta Hospital has also done transplants with out-of-country donors and recipients . <p> By contrast , Toronto 's St. Michael 's Hospital -- concerned about the perception of the practice -- has so far refused to perform kidney transplants for patients who come from overseas with living donors , said Dr. Jeffrey Zaltzman , head of the St. Michael 's program . <p> An even more contentious issue is whether to let foreign nationals receive an organ from a dead Canadian donor . A chronic shortage of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transplant every year . <p> The ground-breaking University of Alberta islet-transplant program implants insulin-producing cells from the pancreases of dead donors into diabetics doing poorly on traditional treatment . <p> Dr. James Shapiro , a world leader in the experimental procedure , said he gets about 10 calls or emails a week from patients around the world for access to the islets , or actual transplant procedures . <p> He said he has been willing to oblige foreigners in situations where the centre had enough cells on hand that no Canadians were on the waiting list . His hospital , however , has denied the requests , voicing concerns about scarce beds being occupied by the foreign patients . <p> " I think they missed the concept , that somebody from overseas could benefit , " said Dr. Shapiro . " I think they were a little narrow-minded .

" Now you 're giving a precious resource to someone and the medication post-transplant is very expensive ; they may go back to their country where they do n't have access to it . " <p> In a paper just published in the journal Progress in Transplantation , two Toronto ethicists outline the issues and suggest possible policies , from denying all foreign nationals to allowing a limited quota on transplant wait lists , as the United States and some European countries already do . <p> " The tension is mainly between two arguments , " notes the paper by Rebecca Bruni and Linda Wright of the University of Toronto 's joint centre for bioethics .

@@4122233 <p> Pierre McGuire is a fairly polarizing figure in hockey media . While he undoubtedly has experience as an NHL scout and coach , as well as some inside connections , he 's prone to hyperbolic statements about whatever team he happens to be covering at the time , and never owning up when he 's caught dead wrong . In fact , usually when McGuire 's hyperbolic narratives are shown to be wrong , he claims he said the exact opposite at some point or another and was right all along . The best part is , he 's probably not lying , because he changes his entire outlook on hockey depending entirely on who he 's talking to . <p> While Pierre certainly has his fans , and I 'm not one of them , I do sometimes enjoy listening to him on The Team990 's ' Melnick in the Afternoon ' , as at times he can be very insightful about the game . However after listening to his borderline tirade the day after the Canadiens were eliminated from the playoffs this year , I think it 's high time to take him down a notch . The clip is here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it for context . <p> It 's been fairly obvious for the better part of the last decade that Pierre McGuire is quite bitter about his services never being requested by the Montreal Canadiens organization , this vitriol becoming even more clear when the man who fired him in Ottawa was named general manager of the Habs last year . This inherent lack of professionalism in his commentary is further worsened by the fact that he 's a huge Habs fan , and is n't able separate that from his commentary . <p> McGuire 's core criticism of Canadiens management and the team itself is that they were behind on his personal model for success , what he calls a " 7 player profile " . Interesting side note , Pierre McGuire has never managed an NHL team , so his experience in this area is basically that of a fan , not an experienced manager who 's had success previously . McGuire outline 's how the Habs fit and do n't fit his model as follows : <p> Big stopping defensemen ( what ? I assume he means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says basically the Habs wo n't get that from Markov again so there 's a hole there . Questionable ? McGuire says : Fail <p> Two elite centers : Pierre claims that Montreal has zero elite centers , yet cites Dave Bolland and Patrick Sharp ( a natural RW ) as elites . Now I do n't consider any center on the Canadiens elite , but I do n't think anyone in the world considers Dave Bolland to be a better NHL player than Tomas Plekanec . Maybe Dave Bolland 's mom , and I think Sharp and Plekanec are very similar players . So if they count , Plekanec counts . Yet Pierre says : Fail x2 <p> Power forward : McGuire states boldly that Montreal does not have a power forward anywhere in the organization . I guess he forgot that we have a budding one , he just had his neck broken in March is all . McGuire says Fail <p> Specialist ( what ? I 've never heard this term pertaining to hockey before ) : Pierre says Gionta and Plekanec are both in this made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pass <p> So overall Pierre McGuire gives the Canadiens a 3/7 mark on his incredibly simplified recipe for success in the NHL . Personally , looking over this list I do n't think McGuire cares about the truth at all , he just wants to bash Gauthier . Looking at the Canadiens roster , excluding upcoming UFAs for the purposes of only looking at guaranteed players for next year , I would rank the Habs much differently , I 'll look only at those spots where Pierre has given a failing grade : <p> Elite defensive defenseman : I 'm assuming this is what McGuire actually meant , because if he meant what he literally said then the Habs had that this year in Gill . Hal is great but I would n't call him elite because of his limitations at even strength . Josh Gorges however , is easily an elite defensive defenseman . He 's one of the best penalty killers in the NHL , has above average skating , plays above his size and occasionally chips in offensively . Pass <p> Two elite centers : By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ideal #2 center of course , but here is where Pierre is correct , the Habs need more depth at center . Luckily Lars Eller was acquired in the trade for Jaroslav Halak last year that McGuire hated so much , and as evidenced by his play in the playoffs he could very well be a couple seasons from achieving this goal . 1 Pass , 1 Fail <p> Power forward : I 'm not sure what Pierre was smoking on April 28th to forget Max Pacioretty , but this is perhaps the player I 'm most excited to see don the CH next season . The characteristics that define a power forward are speed , strength , physicality , no fear and scoring ability . Max showed all of this last year , and at just 21 he 's only going to get better . Ideally a power forward should contribute 30 goals and 50 points at the least , both marks Pacioretty was on pace for had he played all of the 2010-11 season . Pass <p> So it seems Montreal is only in need of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 've been looking for since Damphousse was ousted . This need ended up leading to the worst move of Bob Gainey 's tenure as GM , acquiring Scott Gomez for a package including Ryan McDonagh , the only real loss of the trade , but a big one . <p> Even without a true #1 center however , depth at that position in the Canadiens organization is stronger than it has been in a long time . Plekanec , Gomez , Eller and David Desharnais are possibly good enough as a group to overcome the lack of a true #1 , especially if Gomez has a bounce back year . <p> Surprisingly enough though , McGuire does n't stop there in his rant , further offering Pierre Gauthier some advice on what to do with Scott Gomez : <p> " I 'd try to trade him . I 'd try to trade him . I 'd try to package him with a draft pick and try to trade him . " <p> " You 've got to , you 've got to find a way to package him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have him back and start the season in Montreal with him on your team with the money he 's making . I just do n't know how you can do it . " <p> Yet another brilliant idea by the experienced NHL general manager rabid fan bombastic commentator . Much like many fans wanted to do with Carey Price last season , McGuire is suggesting the Canadiens deal Gomez at the absolute lowest his value will ever be . At this moment he 's coming off the worst year of his career , and still making more money than his cap hit , automatically ruling out most teams in the NHL as potential trade partners . From a guy who 's been whining about maximizing potential return on Halak for the last 10 months , he does n't seem to be very consistent here . Not to mention he 's suggesting the Canadiens lose an asset in a high round pick in order to jettison Gomez , and you 're still left with a gaping hole on your second line . <p> After Melnick suggests the Canadiens need to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canadiens of cruising along using band-aid solutions . I suppose that 's why the entire team was blown up 2 years ago . <p> Pierre then continues on , going through the Eastern Conference claiming that various teams are primed to get better , while insinuating that Montreal is not on that track . McGuire then goes on to make the same prediction he made last season , that if the Canadiens do n't make big moves they 'll miss the playoffs next season , again slandering Canadiens management saying he does n't know if they 'll be honest with the fans , and oddly enough predicting another Gomez-like trade . As he continues he claims that Canadiens management is so smug that they do n't understand their own weaknesses . <p> Detailing why McGuire does n't think the Canadiens will make the playoffs next year , it seems to come down to a lack of young " difference makers " in their top prospects group , citing players like John Tavares and Jeff Skinner , specifically who will make the team next year . Well Pierre , last time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight , so they have n't exactly had top 10 picks in the draft like Tavares ( #1 ) or Skinner ( #7 ) . Yet despite this lack of high end picks the Canadiens still have a sparkling group from the 2007 draft class on the team next season in Subban , Eller , Pacioretty and Yannick Weber . Last I checked you do n't need a high impact rookie coming onto the team every season to make a difference , you need young players to step up , and the Canadiens have that in spades . <p> When McGuire asks Melnick who will be a difference maker for the Habs , Mitch states that " We see who their prospects are , their prospects are pretty much 3rd and 4th line guys " , to which McGuire responds ; " Correct " . <p> Really ? That 's odd because the next day Pierre went off about how great Chris Kreider is , and how he " ripped up and shredded college hockey the last two years . " For those who do n't know who Kreider is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rangers took one spot after Louis Leblanc in 2009 . Here are his stats : <p> I was n't aware that 47 points in 70 games was ripping up and shredding a league . Now I do n't want to diminish Chris Kreider , he 's an excellent hockey player and he 'll be good for the Rangers , but he 's not Sidney Crosby . Still though , it 's too bad our inept management passed him over for that 3rd or 4th liner Louis Leblanc , right ? Let 's look at his stats : <p> Hm , for a 3rd or 4th liner who 'll never make an impact like Chris Kreider will , it 's kind of weird that Leblanc was able to put up the same 23 points as a rookie in the NCAA while playing 7 fewer games , struggling with a broken wrist for half the season , and playing on a far inferior team . Damn , what a mistake by Gainey and Gauthier ! <p> In that same audio clip ( April 29th now ) McGuire also went on about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young Dmitri Orlov possibly making the team next season . I 've seen Orlov play , he 's very good , and he played well in his 25 games with Hershey this season ( including playoffs ) , but the comparison McGuire makes is so hyperbolic you have to question his sanity . He says Orlov will be the next Sergei Zubov , and to " trust me on that " . I 'm sorry Mr. McGuire , but I do n't think I 'll trust you that the 20th defensemen taken in the 2009 NHL Entry Draft will be an equal to perhaps the greatest Russian defenseman of all time . I especially wo n't " trust you on that " before Orlov plays a single minute in the NHL . Sergei Zubov recorded 771 points in 1068 NHL games , and another 117 points in 164 playoff games . This is a potential Hall of Famer we 're talking about . <p> He also claims that Orlov is better than any prospect the Canadiens have , but that all depends on what you consider a prospect . @ @ @ have him ranked as a 7.0 C , a good prospect that could be very good , but not great . According to Hockey 's Future Montreal currently has 4 prospects who project to be as good or better players than Orlov ; Danny Kristo , Louis Leblanc , Jarred Tinordi , and Yannick Weber . Combine this with the fact that in the last calendar year Montreal has graduated Lars Eller , Max Pacioretty , P.K. Subban , Benoit Pouliot , Tom Pyatt and David Desharnais , it 's amazing we 're still ranked in the middle of the pack as far as prospect depth goes . <p> In reality ; the real one , not Pierre McGuire 's delusional version , the Canadiens actually have very solid prospect depth . In fact they would likely rank a bit higher if Hockey 's Future did n't criminally underrate the recently acquired Michael Bournival . In many ways Michael Bournival actually outplayed Louis Leblanc this season , and he 's a year younger . However Leblanc being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him getting the top billing among Habs prospects . Look for Bournival to increase his profile in a big way next year for Canada 's World Junior team , he was the final cut this year . <p> With the likely departures of Roman Hamrlik and Jeff Halpern this summer , and Spacek the year after that , this team is getting younger every year , contrary to the opinion of McGuire and many so-called pundits out there , who make snap judgments based on recent events , and do n't ever bother to look at issues in-depth . <h> Join Eyes On The Prize <h> Authenticating <h> Great ! <p> Choose an available username to complete sign up . <p> In order to provide our users with a better overall experience , we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience .

And that 's just Disney ; when you take into account Mattel ( Barbie ) , Nickelodeon and all the other companies telling parents that their products encourage girls to explore their femininity , and telling girls that the acquisition of clothes and accessories will enable them land a husband and be happy , things begin to look ... scary . Almost conspiracy-like . <p> When most people see a conspiracy , they also see crap . Orenstein 's super-power is to unpack the conspiracy theory into episodes that persuade rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . First is a chatty , intimate , humorous tone , where all readers are Orenstein 's BFFs ; the book is engineered less as manifesto than the musings of a very smart ( but non-threatening ) mom looking out for her daughter . She constantly cites studies that show that the emphasis on beauty and play -- sexiness increase girls ' chances of falling prey to eating disorders , risky sexual behaviour , depression and more , and yet , Cinderella ... is a fun read , seemingly driven by concern rather than fear . <p> Orenstein 's second weapon is a rather noble insistence on exploring every side of every issue ; it never appears as though the author has an agenda to push , other than making sure that her daughter grows up happy ( now , argue with that ) . Princess stands for entitlement , passivity and prescriptive consumerism , but as Orenstein muses , it 's also shorthand for special , and which parent does n't believe her daughter is special ? <p> While attending a beauty pageant for five-year-olds , Orenstein finds that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; upon learning that one of the participants had a sibling with severe physical and mental disabilities , she notes that the parents might view the pageant as an affirmation of the young girl 's normalcy . And when Orenstein 's six-year-old daughter finally rejects Disney Princesses , saying they 're all about " I 'm so pretty , Handsome Prince , wo n't you rescue me ? " , Orenstein rejoices , but typically , also faces self-doubt and guilt : has she brainwashed her child ? <p> Many rabble readers may feel Orenstein over-argues the obvious ; heck , I doubt any will disagree that Canada should emulate Sweden and ban advertising to children under 12 . This book will not fortify the sort of parents who 've cut cable , buy no-logo clothing and who worry about the potential social ostracism of their boat-rocking offspring . <p> CinderellaAte My Daughter is targeted towards **31;218;TOOLONG parents who feel an unarticulated but gradually escalating discomfort with present-day cultural constructions of girlhood .

With a hefty price tag the city council had the project shut down . That plan was a score for Mayor Rob Ford who wanted the project shut down when he was a councillor . <p> The bridge was to open in time for the War of 1812 bicentennial . Supporters say it 's a key renewal project for the waterfront .

His incredible speed left players in the dust , as he sped down the right side , and took shots at opposing goaltenders . <p> That , however , is where the problems begin .

It become apparent to opposing teams that when the puck was on Gionta 's stick , he would most certainly attempt a shot on goal . <p> And when I say it is partially his linemates fault , that is a big part of the equation . During the middle of the season , Gionta was lined up with Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn , a stretch where all three players showed good numbers offensively . However , when he was placed back on the wing of Scott Gomez , his numbers dropped , primarily because of the horrible season Gomez was enduring . While saying that , the overly defensive style of play employed by Coach Jacques Martin is n't conductive to offensive production . <p> In my opinion , Gionta needs to get more creative , and not play such a north-south style of game . He also needs to learn to distribute the puck more , and not try to force shots on goal when they 're not available . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage of the middle of the ice more in the offensive zone , and using different shooting angles . After all , taking shots from the wing make a goalie job much easier .

@@4127240 <p> Sun News Network expected to be attacked for its politics -- not its professionalism . But the reviews of the conservative-leaning news channel have pointed out that it looks amateurish : " The sets and lighting are Spartan , " wrote Brad Oswald of the Winnipeg Free Press ; Globe and Mail critic John Doyle called it " cheap , cheesy , terrible television . " That 's not a charge often levelled at Sun 's U.S. model , Fox News , whose high production values are acknowledged even by people who hate it . If Sun has trouble looking classy , it has nothing to do with the rather modest short skirts and sleeveless dresses ; it may be because of the unexciting scenes behind them . <p> The hyper-patriotic Sun turned to the Toronto-based AKA Creative Group to design the sets . Andrew Kinsella , AKA 's president , feels they created " a style that Canadians have never seen before , " but adds that it would be " a lot more expensive to work with the big-name design competitors south of the border . " But on screen , the American competitors sometimes look more spectacular . Ezra Levant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fox show ; it has the host do wacky conservative things like destroy a bush to show his contempt for Earth Day . But Beck 's program has an elaborate set and there 's creative use of camera angles and lighting . Levant 's set , dominated by two fairly small TV screens with his name on them , looks much more low-tech . And like many of the Sun shows , the backgrounds are often monolithically blue , which can give news shows a feeling of sameness : U.S. set designer Jim Fenhagen , who designed shows like ABC World News Tonight , has n't seen Sun but told Maclean 's that as a general rule , " doing blue sets is pretty old-fashioned now . " <p> While some Sun programs make good use of space -- Kinsella is proud of the main news hub , with a " retractable rear-projection screen as well as flexibility for the host to move freely from one area to another " -- others do n't look much more big-budget than the average local newscast . Some of the daytime shows feature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drab-looking newsroom in the background , the kind of thing Fenhagen tried to avoid when he created the newsroom set for ABC : " Usually the main shot is all the people back there and you ca n't get rid of them , which I think is a mistake . " Conservative TV host Michael Coren , who has appeared as a guest on Sun , considers the overall look " sharp and modern " but added that " because of the number of linked interviews with guests around the country , there is always going to be a certain limitation to the overall look . " But those limitations may mean the Sun hosts ca n't compete with a Fox personality like Megyn Kelly , the network 's aggressively blond daytime star , who yells at guests against a stylish background of glass , metal and flickering screens . <p> Another difference between Sun and Fox is that Fox is a little subtler about plugging itself . The Sun logo is often omnipresent : Theo Caldwell , the tousled-haired host of the O'Reilly Factor imitator The Caldwell Account , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into it , suggesting Stephen Colbert 's desk that 's shaped like the first letter of his name . Brian Lilley , host of The Byline , sits in front of a background that has almost nothing on it except his own name and the name of his show . Fox News is cannier about pushing its brand name on its viewers ; even when the logo is part of a Fox News set , it 's done in an almost subliminal way , like the semi-transparent logos on the set of Fox &amp; Friends . " People do like to see the logo , " Fenhagen says , but a network needs to avoid " over-logoing it . " <p> In the end , it could be that what matters for Sun 's future is not production values but Canada 's desperate need for conservative content . " I 'd watch an Ezra or a Theo in a box , instead of any standard Canadian host in a palace , " Coren says . But as Fox News frequently points out , many of its viewers are independents attracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-liberal mission , declared the conservative blog Rightchik , Sun " looks like a small-town television station production .

In other words , if you want to be a carrier , you ca n't have the other pieces . <p> Canada 's news and opinion channels to us , provided by fiat by the CRTC , are concentrated in the hands of very few corporations , and that makes for sharply-restricted freedom of speech , expression , and unbiased news . Anyone that doubts this should review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that took place at CBC , CTV , G&amp;M and TorStar during this past election . Truly disgusting . <p> The Sun Newspaper chain ? The National Post ? These are considered conservative mediums ; thus , those who hold these values have never been denied any view or thought outside the left side of the political spectrum . This argument , from all right-wingers , is tired . <p> I watched Adler for about 5 minutes and changed the channel . the production was a small step up from local variety shows on communicty TV and the interview was a pathetic , ideologically driven piece of garbage . I was hopeful that a credible alternate source would emerge from this concept , but I should have known better . This is the Sun we are talking about . <p> I 'm curious to know if there 's a theory out there about how long new channels have to establish and attract viewers -- I read that Oprah 's OWN network is also strugglng -- operating a flailing network would bleed money and advertisers wo n't want to advertise there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oprah 's deep pockets to keep funding until there 's more viewers , or do they go broke trying ? <p> Agreed that suntv is neither slick nor easy on the eyes , but there is integrity there , and one hopes that the owners will get the format right for the new season starting after the summer silly season . Their right of centre , no nonsense viewpoint is desperately needed in Liberalized Canada . <p> Once again , for all you thick-headed people out there that try to slag SNN , the network has nothing to do with Fox , and never did . It 's owned by Quebecor , the owner of the Sun newspaper chain . Criticize the sets all you want , but get off this " Fox news north " stupidity . Maybe they need to jazz things up a little , but that dumb tie-in exists only in the feverish minds of liberals . <p> You idiots , they are competing with you and knocking your socks off by providing content that your liberal livers ca n't stomach . <p> If it were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Layton 's visit(s) to the sleazehouse would have been buried for ever .

Your editors and Andrew Coyne represent to me , the " entitled " , as you attempt to discredit Sun -- TV . Did you buy into Frank Graves " culture war " and are now upset that you lost ? Yup , guess us old men in Alberta will just be votin ' for Palin and Sun-TV . By the way , I am a university educated woman who appreciates the " politically incorrect " programming of Sun-TV . Relevance is consumer-based , not media generated , as your self-important bias attempts to portray . You have expressed your " opinion " , now I am expressing mine . Get over yourselves .. <p> I think there are quite a few more people who like the idea of SunTV than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I 'll repeat that the market for a right-wing political channel in Canada is minuscule , and if they ca n't branch into other interests , such as business , they 'll die a quick death . If all they wanted was an alternative voice , a syndicated show , with 20 minute slots for Adler , Lilley , and Levant would have been a much more effective use of money . <p> Maybe Quebecor will string this along as long as the Financial Post has been hemorrhaging money , but I doubt it . <p> Really ? What evidence do you have to support this ? Right wing talk radio regularly tops audience ratings . Conservatives are sick of the two " me too " channels . They are sick of having their pockets picked by $1.1 billion to finance one of them .

And several of those natural disasters have led to financial help from the federal government in order to help ensure recovery . <p> In July 1996 , for example , Quebec sought aid after at least 10 people were killed and nearly 16,000 people were forced from their homes in Quebec 's Saguenay River valley , after nearly 300 millimetres of rain fell in less than 36 hours . <p> Less than a year later , 25,447 Manitobans evacuated their homes when the Red River swelled , blanketing 2,560 square kilometres of land in water at its peak , on May 4 , 1997 . <p> In both cases , the federal government provided financial assistance to help the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ related to the Saguenay flood , and $193.8 million to Manitoba for the Red River flood . <p> The federal Disaster Financial Assistance Arrangements program has paid out more than $1.9 billion since its inception , according to documents from the federal Public Safety Department . <p> The $855 million Quebec has gleaned from that account dwarfs the $238 million given to British Columbia , $165 million to Alberta , $141 million to Ontario , and $50.5 million to New Brunswick . <p> Manitoba 's 1997 Red River flood was one of the largest on record , requiring more than 7,000 military personnel deployed for 36 days to help relocate the tens of thousands of displaced Manitobans and to help prevent further flood damage . <p> There are established causes of the flooding tendencies of rivers flowing through Manitoba 's landscape , but there is nothing about Quebec 's topography or geography that makes it especially prone to large-scale natural disasters such as earthquakes , tornadoes , flooding or ice storms , Clague says . <p> " But we ca n't forget , Quebec had two major , major disasters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ice storm -- which left more than 3.2 million people without power in the middle of winter -- and the Saguenay flood . <p> " But , we also ca n't forget that two other provinces were also hit by the ice storm . Quebec was most severely impacted , but Ontario was also severely impacted . " <p> A majority of the money Quebec has received -- $535 million -- was a result of the 1998 ice storm that paralyzed the western part of the province when more than 100 millimetres of freezing rain and ice pellets poured down on the region , destroying power lines , leaving some areas without power for weeks and prompting more than 200 communities in the province to declare states of emergency . <p> Ottawa set up the disaster assistance fund in an effort to help provinces and territories with recovery expenses exceeding what they " might reasonably expect to bear on their own , " which the federal government has pegged at $1 per capita . The cost sharing is calculated on a scale , so as the cost of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fund , administered through the Public Safety Department , recently distributed financial assistance to Prince Edward Island for the effects of hurricane Juan in 2003 , British Columbia , for the 2003 wildfires and to Alberta , for the 2005 floods . <p> " My sense is we 're becoming more vulnerable economically to disasters because our cities are growing . With increased urbanization , wealth is essentially being concentrated in cities and hazardous areas , increasingly putting the wealth at risk , " he says . <p> An earthquake that struck Vancouver 50 years ago , for example , might have produced tens of millions of dollars in damage , Clague says . But an earthquake of similar magnitude today would likely incur hundreds of millions -- or even billions -- in damages , he says . <p> And if you survey the country from coast to coast to coast , it quickly becomes clear that no province is immune to some sort of natural disaster . <p> Alberta and Saskatchewan are relatively safe compared to other provinces , but both are still susceptible to tornadoes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rockies , Clague notes . <p> The impact of any disasters that occur in the northern territories would yield fewer financial burdens since the population is so sparse . <p> In other regions , parts of British Columbia , Ontario and Quebec are prone to earthquakes , Manitoba 's main weather foe is floods , and the Eastern provinces have had to pick up the pieces after being ravaged by hurricanes . <p> Considering so many provinces are susceptible to natural disasters , Clague says it 's surprising to see such a discrepancy between the amount of federal funding each province has received . <p> " Averaged out over time , once you normalize the data , it should n't be so disproportionate , " he says . " Quebec had its two major disasters which would skew it slightly , but what still surprises me is that with the ice storm , since Ontario was affected too , the funding should have jacked Ontario way up over Manitoba .

The special constables are responsible not only for the Ontario Court of Justice in Peterborough but also the Superior Court of Justice on Water Street . <p> " They have a huge responsibility in supporting the criminal justice process and supporting the work of the Crown 's office and the Ministry of the Attorney General staff functions and protecting not only the staff and the public but the actual prisoners , " explains Police Chief Murray Rodd . <p> He adds that special constables in Court Services are pros at multi-tasking and are cross-trained on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part that helps the system flow smoothly , " explains Special Constable John Coburn , who has worked in Court Services for the past 11 years . <p> What most people see in court are the two Special Constables sitting at the front of each courtroom providing security . What they do n't see is the many other important services provided by Special Constables at the courthouse , including picking up and dropping off the Crown briefs , taking DNA samples , escorting people in custody and keeping track of every moment of the people in the cells . <p> Special Constable Barry Taylor , who has worked in the Court Services division for nearly eight years , likes variety of his job . <p> On this Monday morning ( May 9 ) , special constables Jin Lee , who has been on the job for just four months , and John Coburn are in charge of escorting people held in custody in the City . After taking care of a few other duties they head out on the road to pick up three young offenders at Park Place for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ male youth in Peterborough . The two Special Constables arrive at the home giving the three young men a friendly greeting as they shackle their hands and load them into the police van . <p> The three youths are brought into the back of the courthouse and into the cell area where they are separated from what is called the general population , and where they will have to hang tight and wait their turn before the judge . <p> Then Special Const . Lee and Coburn turn around and head out to the City police station on Water Street to pick up a woman held in custody and bring her back to the courthouse . <p> Special Const . Coburn says a large part of their job is dealing with the emotions of people held in custody , people he describes as having high needs , wanting to know everything from when their lawyer will arrive to when they will get in front of a judge to what they will be getting for lunch . <p> He says the best advice he can give to any special constable in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you do n't know the answer , say you do n't know . <p> " Ninety-nine per cent of the time the people in custody are not mad at us , " he explains . <p> " Credibility is all you have with them so you do n't want to burn that bridge . " <p> While Special Const . Lee and Coburn take care of the escorts , Matt Thomas and Mike Moncrief stay at the desk in the cell area . Their job is to track and record the every movement of a prisoner , when they are taken out of their cell to talk to their lawyer in an interview room or go before a judge , and when they come back . Inside the office in the cells are large screen televisions that allows the Special Constable at the desk to watch what is going on in each of the cells , and in the hallways , at any given time . <p> They also record every prisoner that arrives from the Central East Correctional Centre in Lindsay via the OPP Transport Unit .

Coburn . <p> " There 's no better training than life skills . " <p> Special Const . Coburn adds that for him the job can become monotonous on some days , but they always have to be ready to react to any situation . <p> The ability of a special constable to react quickly was recently put to the test in a Peterborough courtroom . During a sentencing hearing at the Ontario Court of Justice on April 1 , the mother of a sexual assault victim used a pair of scissors to stab the man found guilty of assaulting her 15-year-old daughter . Police reported that the 38-year-old Hastings woman used a small pair of scissors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the metal detector at the courthouse was activated during that time for a three-week trial period , the small scissors were not seized as they were not an item listed on the prohibited list . The mother is now facing charges including assault with a weapon and uttering death threats . The man was treated at the Peterborough Regional Health Centre and released . <p> Chief Rodd says the mother had been following the trial for months and had been working a midnight shift . <p> " She had waited all day to see justice done and acted out of what appeared to be frustration , " he explains . <p> " The reality is despite the fact that we can seize weapons and obvious weapons of opportunity at the door , we would have to literally resort to seizing ball point pens , potentially eye wear because glass lenses could be broken and used as a weapon to taking people 's belts off so they could n't use them to choke somebody .

" <p> Chief Rodd says what this incident has clearly indicated is that although they can take steps , such as having a metal detector in place , to get rid of potential weapons at the door to the courthouse there 's no replacement for the response capabilities of a special constable in a courtroom to deal with the incident . <p> " They special constables are out of sight in terms of operations , unless you get to court . They are sort of invisible to the main community but they 're invaluable to our whole community 's safety responsibility , " he notes . <p> Sergeant Tim Millard , who has been the supervisor of court services for the past two years , describes the courts as the last stop for people that are charged with both criminal and non-criminal offences . <p> " This is where the whole file gets put together , " he explains . <p> " The actual volume of cases that goes through here in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 99 per cent of the charges they deal with have to do with drinking and drugs , which leads to many of the domestic assaults and assaults in general . <p> He says depending on the charge , Special Constables in Court Services could be dealing with the same people for months or even years .

" You are getting what you want : both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a secular education program available in Morinville this September . " <p> The minister went on to reference a previous letter to Morinville Parent Delegation spokesperson Donna Hunter in which the minister said the issue is not whether or not Morinville parents have a right to secular education , but how that education should be provided . <p> Hancock told Kirsop the exact form that secular education will take could only be decided on when the number of students who would register in such a program is known . <p> GSACRD concluded a survey May 16 through Edmonton-based pivotal Research Inc . Results of the survey , which was sent to parents of children in Morinville schools and a random sampling of no less than 400 other residents , is expected to be revealed by the end of May . <p> In Hancock 's letter , the minister defended his relative public silence on the issue . <p> " It would be a mistake to interpret my relative public silence on this matter as a lack of interest , or as an indication that I am abrogating my responsibilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As I have indicated in previous correspondence with you , given the history and intricacies of this situation , there is no simple way to address the concerns you have raised . I can assure you that my staff and I are working closely with the GSACRD board of trustees to ensure that a secular education program will be available to the parents of Morinville this fall . " <p> But Kirsop said he believes the situation would be different if the issue were not religion , stating if a public school board promoted one ethnic group above and to the exclusion of all others , the minister would not repeatedly send a group of concerned parents back to the board to work it out . If it were one gender , one age group or one socio-economic class , Kirsop feels Hancock would reach into his ministerial tool box and loudly and proudly battle discrimination . <p> " I want my public school board to run my public schools for all the public , " Kirsop wrote in reply to Hancock 's May 18 letter .

" <p> Kirsop concluded that the cookies were a reminder that as an elected representative with a ministerial portfolio Hancock is supposed to represent and stand for all of the public . <p> GSACRD is currently talking to potential partners to provide a secular program beginning this fall for Morinville children whose parents wish it . A picture of just what the program will look like will not be known until the survey results are revealed . <h> 3 COMMENTS <p> Dave Hancock : " There is no simple way to address the concerns you have raised . " <p> He could require GSACRD to obey the law . <p> When a citizen faces some hardship in the course of obeying the law , is it the minister 's problem ? Of course not .

No one yet has any idea what form the solution GSACRD will offer is going to take ( at least not those of us outside that board ) . I believe it behooves us all to allow them a little bit of time to figure out how many people want what so that they may actually give people a well considered plan of action to address the current concerns . Shotgun solutions rarely work out the way people want them to and often make things worse . Let them figure it out before you pull the trigger .

But despite the fact the dump has been closed for quite some time , people continue to leave their garbage here regularly and along many other roads secluded from residential areas in Conception Bay North . <p> " We 've been noticing this problem for the last two years for sure , " said Gerald Harris , an animal control officer who often picks up animals near the old dump road .

" <p> Such a move allows contractors to avoid paying tipping fees of $65.50 per tonne . By doing so they would be increasing profit from a job , even if the cost of dumping debris at Robin Hood Bay were factored into the price charged for a job . <p> There 's evidence of further dumping along New Harbour Road coming out of Spaniard 's Bay .

Many people might have been scared away from hockey after such a horrific injury , but says it 's just a risk you take while pursuing a dream of playing professional hockey . <p> He signed a professional contract with the Edmonton Oilers to play in Hamilton after completing his junior hockey career , but did n't pass the physical at the Oilers ' camp though , due to a nagging injury . <p> " My shoulder did n't pass the test , " Martin said . <p> " It actually popped out in the doctor 's hands during my checkup .

It was frustrating because I did n't want to change my style of play . " <p> Life off the ice was a different story . <p> " I enjoyed living there and travelling through Europe because it was beautiful , but the hockey sucked , " Martin said . <p> He comes home to Timmins every year for two or three months to train and spend time with family and friends . <p> " I also work in roofing ( Prudent Roofing ) for the summer and then head out again when hockey starts up , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life has been since he was 17 , when he left to go tryout for the QMJHL . <p> Over the years , Martin has had an opportunity to play with and meet a number of players who have gone on to play in the National Hockey League , including Ales Hemsky , Alex Henry , Steve Sullivan , Jiri Fischer and Derek Broussard . <p> Martin has yet to make it to the NHL , but if he had to do things over again he likely would not change too much . <p> " I do n't regret going after a career in hockey , " he said . <p> " I could have gone to Hamilton after my first year of university and I could have got some time in before the lockout . <p> " I have n't had a dream career in the NHL , but I 've had a good time in the minors and I 've got to see the world while doing it .

I would have loved to experience education as guided by my own curiosity , taught at my own pace , and marked by my own individual achievements . Want to learn about frogs ? Sure ! How to count change ? Yes ! The Harper government ? Er -- why not ! ? In theory , this type of ' unchooling ' seems like the best model for education . Students typically absorb information more effectively if they are genuinely interested in the subject matter , rather than forced to follow a curriculum . And when compared to the structure of the conventional school system , whereby grades are often prioritized over actual learning , it 's not hard to see why some parents have opted for this model of education for their children . <p> But the unschooling movement , which recently garnered mainstream attention when two unschooling-advocate parents were featured in a story about their genderless baby , is not without its limitations . Unlike typical homeschooling , whereby parents often follow the provincial curriculum , or else set their own guidelines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It sounds like a good idea in theory , but are unschooled children headed for a rough ride when someone else inevitably takes the reign ? <p> The trouble with unschooling is that it eventually must come to an end . A child may decide to enter the mainstream education system to get the necessary prerequisites for university , or else choose to enter the workforce when he or she deems appropriate . The difficulty , then , is that the individual will be hard-pressed to find an ' Unschooling U , ' and , as far as I know , there is n't a company in Canada offering strong support for an unworking movement . There 's no such thing as unpaying your taxes , unreporting for jury duty , or unfollowing the speed limit on a busy road . Self-determination is a freedom we enjoy in a democratic society , but it is not an absolute . And for children who are given complete control over their education during their formative years , this hard reality may come as a bit of a shock later in life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including the limitations of parental instruction and possible gaps in knowledge . But I 'd say the greater drawback of allowing a child total control over his or her education , absent any schedules , testing , or other forms of accountability , is that it sets an unrealistic and transitory precedent about autonomy and responsibility in everyday life . Like it or not , most people are going to have to show up for work at 9 a.m , pay their taxes on time , and figure out how to register their new vehicles . Gaps in physics knowledge can be easily remedied , but a skewed worldview can not be . <h> Advertisement <h> Post navigation <h> Unschooling has its appeal .

It 's not . Unschooling is both well established in more recent times ( the term , for instance , was created by John Holt in the 70 's ) , and unschooling , or life learning , was how everyone learned for the the vast majority of our existence as a species . Modern day schooling , however , has only been around for a couple hundred years . Now that , as far as I 'm concerned , is the true " experiment . " <p> Links are apparently cut out of comments , so if you 'd like to see that list of grown unschooler interviews , you 'll have to go to my site ( I 'm Unschooled . Yes , I Can Write. ) by clicking on my name , then go to the page " grown unschoolers " listed in the left sidebar . <p> Your misperceptions about unschooling are predicated on specific examples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steretyping . <p> I have two adult unschooled sons ( and one young teen ) who are currently attending college and working full time . Their boss recently told them he did not know how in the world they got such work ethic . It 's unschooling . When kids are responsible for their achievement , they figure out what it takes and get it done . Many unschoolers receive significant guidance from their parents and other accomplished adults in their lives . Unschooling can look just like school if a kid or kid/parent combo thinks that 's the way it should look . Many unschooled kids are quite dedicated to work , study , and hobbies that require quite demanding training and knowledge acquisition . They work on this in the same ways adults to -- they read , they take classes , they practice . <p> You 've taken the most outrageous ( to you ) part of unschooling and made it the sum of the experience for all unschoolers . The truth is , many unschoolers go " undetected " . Those with college aspirations typically decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get thru college , which then gives them the requisite skills needed to get along in traditional classrooms . With the high school dropout rate and the college dropout rate being what they are , I hardly think the narrow population of unschoolers can be seen as at any special risk , and in my experience , they tend to do quite well . As a college instructor , one of my frustrations is that my just-out-of-high-school students struggle with creative thinking , " permission " to be original , and an over-emphasis on following a pre-prescribed formula that will earn them THE grade -- although this often backfires on them since college level work requires so much more synthesis and problem solving . <p> So , I think you probably need to know more about unschoolers and unschooling before presuming that having the ability to self-direct is equated with inability to get to work on time or take care of paperwork .

Do you really think that people who undertake unschooling for their children are so careless and thoughtless as to endanger their children 's future ? My friends , to unschool takes commitment , an ability to network and seek out opportunities as well as to have a ton of curiosity and ingenuity to match your child 's . It takes WORK to unschool .

It 's not that it 's less or not as good or anything . It 's simply different and " not like the other " . Unschooling is not " school at home " , a style some home educators adopt .

I am the teacher and therefore use their interest to form their curriculum . We have a schedule every day , including household chores and volunteering that very much make them understand work first , play second and create a firm foundation in responsibility .

Sure , I can point out that my 4 children were unschooled and successful in college , and I can point to many others -- the difference in my children and the others I know is that we parents , the facilitators of those educations , had and have a vested interest in our children 's success .

Howe Institute that suggests a Big CPP would create more problems than its proponents let on . In Do n't Double Down on the CPP : Expansion Advocates Understate the Plan 's Risks , William Robson says advocates of an expanded CPP as a solution to retirement income worries too often promote it as a plan with guaranteed benefits that are fully funded . <p> The CPP is a gamble , not a guarantee : expanding the plan would raise the stakes on a bet most Canadians do not know they have made . <p> The CPP may look like a defined-benefit plan , but it is not , adds Robson , who is president and CEO of C.

If it were a true Defined Benefit pension plan like most corporate pensions , its contribution rate would have to be 11.3% or more , Robson argues . <p> The Quebec Pension Plan has been forced to trim benefits and raise contributions because of adverse demographic trends and economics , coupled with low investment returns . <p> Expanding the CPP would expose other Canadians to a larger risk of similar disappointments , Robson warns . <p> CPP needs to be shored up , not expanded As a target-benefit plan ( rather than a true DB plan ) , in principle the CPP may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says .

" <p> As I 've argued repeatedly in this blog and columns , an expanded CPP means putting too many of our retirement eggs in the single basket of " government pensions . " As Robson points out , there are other ways to improve the retirement prospects of Canadians , including saving more in RRSPs and TFSAs , and in professionally managed employer pensions for those lacking them ( i.e. the Conservatives ' Pooled Registered Pension Plan or PRPP proposal ) . <p> Fortunately , the Tories do not appear to have backed down from the PRPP , and they still plan to double TFSA contribution limits to $10,000 per person once the books are balanced : hopefully a year early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Tories have not ruled out a " modest " expansion to the CPP .

Given that Quebec is now NDP territory and the fact Jack Layton pushed for an expanded CPP during the recent election , the rest of the country should pay close attention to developments surrounding the QPP . <p> The average retiree gets just over $6,050 in CPP benefits a year , Tufts says , since not everyone paid in at the maximum rate , so even a doubling of CPP or QPP benefits would n't solve the problem of retirement income shortfalls over night .

It 's definitely the opposite of a big , warm hug , reminding them just who 's in charge . <p> I watched Checkpoint Charlie take shape through the winter and spring . With its thick steel posts and concrete foundations , it will stop any madly-rushing vehicle or vanload of lost tourists . I could get into its technical niceties , but people are paying a lot of tax money for Hill security . Suffice to say that it 's more than enough concrete and steel to stop anything with wheels . <p> The Hill is definitely becoming fortified against the hordes of -- well , of what ? -- that seek to attack the place for evil purposes unknown .

Chartier had planned to toss the dynamite into the House of Commons from the visitors ' gallery , but the laugh was on him . <p> And at least one other similar plan was thwarted by police during the Trudeau years . The guy behind it later went on to run a psychiatric patient advocacy group in Toronto . <p> In 1996 , a distraught man drove a jeep up the Hill and plowed it into the front door of the Centre Block .

Security guards have become less friendly , or downright hostile , over the past few years . The Hill has gone from being public space protected from criminals and terrorists to private space in which everyone can be challenged and harassed by security guards . <p> Strangely , it seems to be the Senate guards who are the meanest .

@@4178230 <h> Settlers of Catan : A low-tech island retreat for a plugged-in generation Add to ... <p> A decade ago , you 'd only find it in obscure game stores hidden in the corner of shopping malls or along low-rent streets . Settlers of Catan had a niche market . You had to hunt for it . <p> These days , much has changed . The German board game has become a bona fide social phenomenon . More than 18-million copies have been sold at roughly $50 a pop , making it the most popular new board game in a generation and pushing it to the verge of mainstream . This month , with a version for Android phones set to be released , The Atlantic magazine predicted Settlers would soon become " as American as apple pie . " <p> Settlers is the face of a board-game renaissance - a return to slow , measured pastimes in a smart-phone and video-game era . <p> " It poses a strong alternative to electronic media . It is actually an unplugged experience , " says Guido Teuber , 37 , whose father , Klaus , invented the game . " All of a sudden it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a computer screen . There is something to be said for having this very tactile , social and immediate experience . " <p> Settlers has a simple premise : Players collect and trade resources to develop an island . It 's interactive , there 's no war and no player loses or wins until the final turn . It 's the foremost example of an entire genre of " German-style " games . <p> Such games largely reject the confrontational mantras of traditional board games , such as Risk and Monopoly . Instead , they tend to be more constructive - settling an island , building a network of power plants ( Power Grid ) , a train system ( Ticket to Ride ) a kingdom ( Carcassonne ) or farm ( Agricola ) . The elder Mr. Teuber has spent 30 years developing board games , winning Germany 's prestigious Spiel des Jahres ( game of the year ) award four times , most recently for Settlers . <p> " All of those games are using ways to solve conflict in a non-violent way , " says his son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North American expansion . " After two world wars , and Germanpeople realizing it 's time to do things dramatically differently , there 's definitely a wave of pacifism that 's reflected in the game culture . " <p> First invented in 1995 , Settlers took hold among young professionals , students and what Mr. Teuber calls " techies " - the game is a favourite throughout Silicon Valley , where plugged-in employees of the world 's cutting-edge technology firms routinely break for a definitively low-tech game of Settlers . <p> It became popular because it had a unique design , was easy to learn and quick to play , said Ontario player Robin Baksh , who started playing a decade ago in university and was among three Canadians to earn a spot in last year 's Settlers world championship in Germany . <p> " A lot of people will win or do very well at their first game , " says Mr. Baksh , now 30 . " Because of that , there 's the incentive to keep going . " <p> About five years ago , the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the kitchen tables of families . <p> " It 's huge . It 's absolutely huge , " says Cheryl Cameron , 52 , owner of Edmonton 's River City Games . Once mostly a pool table vendor , her small chain has reinvented itself on the back of board games and Settlers . In two of her stores , board game sales now make up 70 per cent of revenue . Settlers has been the top seller for six years . <p> " One of the contributing factors has certainly been a great deal of concern with our children today , in that a lot of them lack social skills . I attribute a lot of that to the factthey 're plugged in and not interacting , " says Ms. Cameron , who plays the game with her own eight-year-old granddaughter . <p> The game has some high profile fans , including Black Swan actress Mila Kunis and entrepreneur Reid Hoffman , the low-key founder of LinkedIn , a online networking site that netted him $1.7-billion when it went public last month . " It 's a game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The game holds a special appeal in Canada and the United States , Mr. Teuber believes . " In North Americans , there 's this pioneer spirit .

" <p> The Settlers boon has n't been without its awkward moments , however . The game has a " robber , " or character that blocks squares from use . Initially , it was painted black , raising eyebrows , drawing complaints and surprising the Teuber family . <p> " People e-mailed us and said , ' Hey , why does the robber have to be black ? That 's not cool , ' " Mr. Teuber explains , saying his family was caught off-guard . " Nobody initiallythought about the connotation a black robber would have .

You can play it on your BlackBerry , iPhone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Teuber discusses these almost reluctantly . The game 's foremost appeals - tactile , unplugged , interactive - are n't reflected in phone or computer versions . <p> " We do really see the board game as the meat and potatoes , " he says . <p> The future of Settlers rests in whether it can crack the mainstream . There is optimism : The Atlantic , for instance , wrote that sales are " nearing 25 million copies , " though Mr. Teuber says they sit a touch above 18 million . Either way , it pales to the 275-million copies of Monopoly sold worldwide . ( The Atlantic also published a rebuttal to its own piece , arguing that Settlers was n't , in fact , mainstream . Players here agree . ) <p> The game may have a shot at everyday status if shops like Toronto 's Snakes and Lattes are any indication . The caf ? , which opened last year , has 2,000 board games in stock which clients pay a $5 cover charge to use .

" <p> What is Settlers of Catan ? <p> The concept is of the board game is simple . In each game , 19 hexagonal tiles are arranged randomly to form an island . Each tile represents a resource , and has a die roll number between two and 12 assigned to it . Three or four players ( or up to six , with an expansion ) build cities and roads along the sides and intersections of the tiles . When a tile 's number is rolled , any player who has an adjacent city or settlement collects at least one resource , of which there are five - wheat , sheep , ore , brick and wood . <p> Settlements are worth a point , larger cities are worth two and earn you more resources . Players gather - and , most importantly , trade - resource cards to build roads , new cities and to buy cards .

" Even if you 're in the last place , you still have the feeling you can affect game play , make a difference , even catch up . That stands in contrast to other games . " <p> Tips from an expert <p> Diversify , diversify , diversify . <p> Try to access all five resources if you can - but always get wheat . <p> " If you do n't take wheat , you 'll never win , because it 's the most important commodity , " says Ed Zurawell , 54 , a Sherwood Park , Alta. , resident who won the North American Settlers championship in 2009 . <p> Crunch the numbers to build on the most common rolls , but do n't be afraid to talk , negotiate and trade with other players . <p> Styles differ <p> There are regional qualifying matches for a world championship tournament held biannually in Germany . Three Canadians earned spots at last year 's tournament , with Robin Baksh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the three , ranking 23rd of 52 players . The competitions are intense . Most players are from Europe , where the style of play is slightly different - " Europeans buy more development cards in the gamethan North Americans do , " explains Mr. Baksh . <p> Other Settlers <p> Since the initial game 's release in 1995 , other board game versions and expansions have followed : Seafarers of Catan , Cities and Knights , Traders and Barbarians , and Settlers of America among them , as well as a card-based travel game .

The idea that children retain more of what they learned is perhaps the most popular theory behind year-round schooling - especially for disadvantaged kids . <p> One well-respected Baltimore study tracked a group of 800 students starting in kindergarten and found that during the summer holidays , learning for all students slides , but disadvantaged students regress more than the average .

In practice , the effects of a modified school year have proved difficult to measure compared with more traditional schools . <p> " The differences are usually fairly minor , " says Robert Brown , who has studied year-round schooling as a research co-ordinator with the Toronto District School Board . " Sometimes , the schools with more disadvantaged students do better . But slightly . " <p> Paul von Hippel , a research statistician in sociology at Ohio State University found few benefits in a 2007 study of reading and math test scores of children in kindergarten and first grade in 748 public schools and 244 private schools in the U.S. <p> Still , even those , like Prof. von Hippel , who ca n't find an overwhelming academic bonus do n't consider themselves naysayers . He suggests that to truly see a difference , schools would have to increase the number of instructional days ; currently most year-round schools simply redistribute the roughly 190 days of school all children attend . <p> At the same time , there is good news coming out of some small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Peel Board of Education on students at Roberta Bondar Public School in Brampton , Ont .

For teens , the summer job market has been contracting across North America , too , while year-round part-time work has been on the rise . <p> " Most kids today pick up part-time jobs through the year and they 're working roughly 12 hours , 20 hours at the most per week , rdquo ; says Joan Hamilton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They do that all year round .

In year-round schools such as those in the Calgary Catholic School Board , that means extra time off at Easter , Christmas , March break and in the fall . <p> Summer school sessions are likewise redistributed .

@@4178235 <p> When the British Columbia government did a study to find out how many people were getting permits to build docks , dump sand for artificial beaches and put up lakeside retaining walls , it got some shocking results . <p> On two dozen lakes selected from around the province , researchers found 420 private property Water Act permits had been issued - but more than 4,000 waterfront " modifications " had been done . That means more than 3,500 lakeshore projects were apparently built without authorization . <p> This is n't just a case of widespread non-compliance - it 's an epidemic . But little is being done about it because the province transferred enforcement responsibilities to local government without providing funding . So it 's a free-for-all on the waterfront . <p> " Our lakes are in trouble , " Klaus Kuhn , a director of the Cowichan Valley Regional District , said in a recent e-mail . " To leave local governments struggling with all the responsibilities , but not enough funding , will only result ... in a deteriorating environment .

But cumulatively , it could be damaging . Nobody really knew if the laws drafted to protect waterfront habitat were being respected . <p> So the government decided to take a closer look . Researchers discovered that in their rush to get close to nature , people have been cutting lakeshore vegetation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groynes or retaining walls to stop erosion , and putting in docks at an alarming rate . <p> On Skaha Lake in the southern Okanagan Valley , 100 per cent of the shoreline was rated as " disturbed . " <p> On Prospect Lake near Victoria , where 89 per cent of the shoreline is considered disturbed , the survey found more than 20 docks per kilometre . <p> To determine how many lakeshore residents attained the required permits , researchers randomly selected properties on 24 of the 32 study lakes , then checked to see if their paperwork was in order . <p> On Okanagan Lake , they looked at 35 randomly selected properties - and not one had Water Act authorization . <p> On Vancouver Island only three private property Water Act permits have been issued since 1995 , but there are 380 retaining walls and 791 docks on the lakes studied . <p> But researchers found that the few who did get permits adhered to the terms and conditions of their licences .

Years and years of work is put in by every party , and the stellar breakthrough of the NDP in Quebec was due , according to the party itself , to their years of hard work in the province since Jack Layton became leader . But laying the groundwork for a future election win costs money , and the abolition of the per-vote subsidy is likely to put the Conservatives in a tremendously advantageous position . <h> infographic <h> infographic <p> Last year , almost $60-million poured into the coffers of the five major federal parties , not including private contributions made to individual riding associations .

That dwarfed the $14.3-million collected by the Liberals , the $9.5-million collected by the NDP , and the more than $3-million each collected by the Bloc and Greens . This money was put to good use , as the Conservatives blanketed the airwaves with political advertisements before the campaign , setting the stage for the May 2 majority victory . <p> What will the abolition of the per-vote subsidy mean for the future ?

In leading Turkey away from its authoritarian and military-dominated past , he has made it the model for democracy-hungry Arabs , to whom he has lent strong support , including taking in 4,000 Syrians fleeing Bashar al-Assad 's butchery . <p> Another miracle is Turkey 's economy . At 9 per cent , its growth is second only to China 's and higher than India 's . Its $1 trillion economy is now not too far behind Canada 's . <p> The third miracle is Turkey 's emergence as a strong regional power . Its relations with the United States and Israel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Erdogan 's independent foreign policy of " zero problems with neighbours " has normalized relations and increased trade with neighbours in the Balkans , the Middle East and the Black Sea basin . <p> The fourth miracle -- still in the making -- is that instead of Europe resisting Turkey 's entry into the European Union , it is Turkey that may no longer want the membership . <p> While the government officially remains committed to E.U. , the Turkish people are losing enthusiasm for a continent that 's in economic doldrums , suffering an identity crisis and becoming Islamophobic . <p> Cumulatively , these developments represent a remarkable peaceful , democratic transformation of a nation that just 10 years ago was an economic basket case and where the military routinely toppled the governments it did n't like . <p> Erdogan now becomes the longest-serving Turkish leader since Kemal Ataturk , the founder of secular Turkey after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in the 1920s . <p> With almost all votes counted last night , Erdogan did not get the two-thirds majority of seats that he coveted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his majority , he still can . He would only need to consult the opposition and hold a referendum . That 'd be good for democracy , as would be the changes he proposes to the constitution , a deeply flawed document designed to protect the entrenched interests of the military and its partner in authoritarianism , the judiciary . <p> Both institutions have long resisted democratization , by cleverly posing as protectors of Turkey 's secularism . But it 's not secularism as you and I understand it , but rather authoritarian , anti-religious , anti-democratic and anti-European , anchored in a dangerous nationalism inimical to minorities , such as the autonomy-seeking Kurds . <p> It 's telling that the voters strengthened the main opposition , the secular Republican People 's Party . They rewarded it for abandoning its longstanding support of military intervention in politics but instead emphasizing economic issues and democratic values . <p> Voters also elected several pro-Kurdish MPs . That should spur Erdogan to grant full official recognition of Kurdish identity , something he has been inching towards ever so slowly . <p> His ruling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever that means . It is a Muslim version of Europe 's Christian Democratic parties . Its leaders and its membership tend to be observant Muslims , whose piety should not be equated with fundamentalism , let alone radicalism or militancy . <p> Catering to this mostly merchant class base , the Erdogan government has been fiscally conservative and strongly pro-business . Turkey did suffer a recession because of the 2008 world economic crisis , but pulled out of it quickly -- and without any bailouts for the private sector . It did on the strength of strong domestic consumption by a burgeoning middle class and by moving Turkey 's trade away from Europe to the Middle East , Central Asia and Africa . <p> Turkey 's economy is now the 16th largest in the world and the sixth in Europe . <p> What Erdogan needs to be faulted for is his intolerance of criticism .

It 's difficult to know whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities . But , worryingly , none has been convicted . <p> And when the British magazine The Economist criticized him last week , the prime minister said : " The international media , because they are backed by Israel , would n't be happy with the continuation of the AK Party government . " <p> Whether it 's election rhetoric or his tendency towards populist hyperbole , the prime minister will have to learn to respect the democracy that he has helped usher in . <p> " Turkey is no longer the country the West once knew , " said the European Council on Foreign Relations in a recent report .

@@4181235 <p> The staccato chattering sound of machine-gun fire drifts over Canada 's forward operating base at Masum Ghar in Afghanistan 's Panjwaii district shortly after dusk . The prolonged bursts are answered by other angry shots until , after a couple of minutes , the echoes fade away and silence returns . " That 's probably Wilson killing somebody , " says a soldier relaxing on a makeshift bench outside the metal shipping containers where many of them sleep on stacked bunks . Wilson is an American patrol base a few kilometres north of Masum Ghar , across the Arghandab River in Zhari district . <p> At dawn , from the same direction , the muffled crunch of a distant explosion sends a mushrooming plume of dust skyward above the green cultivated fields and rough mud compounds that spread from Masum Ghar beyond the river . It might have been an improvised explosive device , discovered and intentionally triggered , or perhaps something deadlier . No gunfire follows the blast , only birdsong and the puttering hum of a man coaxing a motorbike along a rutted dirt path . <p> " It 's the Americans at Wilson , " says another soldier . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer to the highway , and now , with the prison break , there are 400 more Taliban there . " <p> A Canadian major who had arrived at Masum Ghar the previous day interjects . " They ca n't clear it ? " <p> " It 's like clearing water , " the first soldier replies . " You can push them aside " -- he sweeps an open palm sideways in front of him -- " but they flow back in . " <p> He describes a near-impossible task , and yet this is what NATO forces in Afghanistan , including Canada 's final combat battle group to deploy in the country , believe they are finally beginning to accomplish . The main reason , according to senior military officials in both Canada and allied nations , is the increased number of troops now on the ground . <p> For eight years following the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the subsequent overthrow of the Taliban , American and NATO soldiers in Afghanistan were too few and spread too thin to hold territory , deny insurgents freedom of movement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Taliban . Training of Afghanistan 's own security forces was fragmented and haphazard . Afghan soldiers and police were unable to effectively step in where outside forces were absent . " As they look back over this , they 'll probably figure that there were some opportunities early on that we did n't take advantage of , " says American Lieut. -Gen . David Rodriguez , commander of the International Security Assistance Force Joint Command . <p> " The enemy regrouped , and by 2005 was starting to come back stronger and stronger , " Rodriguez notes . " And then we kind of were a little bit behind it each time and did n't leap ahead to get the strength and density of forces to improve the security to enable all the other things that are important . The numbers came late . The speed and growth of the Afghan national security forces came late . And what we could n't do is just keep catching up to an ever-growing , strengthening insurgency , and basically shooting behind them . " <p> This meant Canada 's deployment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in what was once their heartland and remains a spiritual home . A summer of hard fighting followed . More than 30 Canadians died in Afghanistan in 2006 , compared to fewer than 10 who perished in the previous four years combined . Similar casualty rates persisted from 2007 to 2009 . <p> The Taliban could not beat the Canadians in open battle , and were defeated when they tried . But the Canadians were also unable to keep control of the ground in Kandahar . Some 2,500 Canadians were responsible for most of the province , including Kandahar city , the second biggest in the country , with a population of half a million . " It has been difficult , because we were n't a large enough force to fight an all out counter-insurgency , " says Brig. -Gen . Dean Milner , the Canadian commander of Task Force Kandahar , which is comprised of both American and Canadian forces . " We were able to contain the Taliban , " he says -- but not defeat them . <p> The effort was n't wasted , says Col. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headquarters . Canadians kept pressure on the Taliban " to ensure that the south was not completely lost . " And then , in December 2009 , U.S. President Barack Obama announced he would send an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan . They arrived last year in Kandahar province , where Canada had been grinding it out since 2006 . Canada transferred responsibility for Zhari and Arghandab districts to American forces in June and handed control of Kandahar city to the Americans in July . " Now I have the forces available to live with the people , to be everywhere we wanted to be , " says Milner . <p> The current Canadian battle group is the largest yet to deploy , and its area of responsibility is smaller than the ground assigned to earlier battle groups , focused on the Panjwaii district of Kandahar province . It is mostly comprised of soldiers from the 1st Battalion of the Royal 22e R ? giment , the Quebec unit known as the Van Doos . The battle group arrived in November and will leave next month . A " mission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canadian bases to soldiers from the United States . About 950 Canadian soldiers will remain in Afghanistan in a non-combat role , training Afghan security forces in Kabul , with smaller contingents in Herat and Mazar-e-Sharif . <p> Canadians in Kandahar say they will not slow down the pace of their operations nor avoid combat as their mission nears its end . Col. Richard Gigu ? re , deputy commander of Task Force Kandahar , likens the transition to a relay race . The Taliban will go to sleep with Canadians in their face and wake up with Americans there . <p> The Canadian soldiers are spread out in a network of forward operating bases , patrol bases , and combat outposts . Some are large and well-fortified camps , with a helicopter landing pad , rows of armoured vehicles or tanks , and a staffed kitchen that prepares hundreds of meals a day . Others are small compounds where the few soldiers who live there sleep in cave-like hovels or out in the open and eat what they make themselves . <p> Often there are units of Afghan soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counterparts . Their numbers have increased as well . Two years ago , one small kandak , or battalion , of Afghan troops covered three districts of Kandahar province . Today there are two kandaks assigned only to Panjwaii district , plus more than 350 trained Afghan police . In September there were 75 . " The insurgency is weak now , " says Ali Urozgani , a sergeant major with the 6th Kandak of the 1st Brigade of the Afghan army 's 205 Corps . He 's partnered with Canadian soldiers and lives with them at a patrol base in Panjwaii . " If they attack , they run away five minutes later , " he says . <p> The concentration of Canadian and Afghan soldiers has frustrated Taliban operations . Two Canadians have died as a result of insurgent attacks since the Van Doos deployed in November . Maj. Fr ? d ? ric Pruneau , commander of Para Company of the Royal 22e R ? giment 's battle group , says his soldiers used to find one or two improvised explosive devices ( IEDs ) every day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are rare . " We 're not chasing them everywhere anymore , because we 're with the population , " he says . <p> " We 've been able to take back the Horn of Panjwaii from the insurgents , " says Lieut. -Col . Michel-Henri St-Louis , commanding officer of the Canadian battle group . " We 're talking about a Taliban stronghold where there was no previous government presence . " <p> Dominating ground militarily , however , is only the first stage in a successful counter-insurgency . International forces in Afghanistan must also win over the local population that might otherwise support the insurgency , and nurture an Afghan government and security forces that can keep that trust and protect civilians who support it . These goals are perhaps more difficult to achieve , and have become more pressing as Afghanistan 's international partners seek to withdraw troops and hand over the security lead to Afghan forces by 2014 . <p> Some of the forward operating bases in Kandahar province have observation balloons hovering above . The cameras mounted on them can zoom in on a farmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket . " Sure , " a special operations adviser to NATO replies when this anecdote is related to him . " But it ca n't tell you what 's in his heart . " <p> At the Masum Ghar forward operating base , Maj. Fr ? d ? ric Pruneau stands in a rough wood-framed building over a table spread with maps of the surrounding countryside and plans a dawn patrol . A silent television in the corner is replaying NHL hockey highlights . Someone has tacked a short history of the 12th Armoured Regiment of Canada , from CFB Valcartier in Quebec , to one of the walls . On another is a photograph of Cpl . Steve Martin , killed by an IED during a foot patrol in December . <p> Surrounding Pruneau are members of his Para Company and Afghan soldiers with whom they will be conducting the operation in the morning . One of the Canadians has the word " determination " tattooed on his forearm . <p> The patrol is to visit the home of a local man whom the Canadians had previously detained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an " insurgent facilitator " because they had found weapons and IED-making material in his house . Pruneau made inquiries with a local power broker and learned the man felt trapped -- intimidated by the Taliban and afraid of being jailed again by the Canadians . They reached an understanding , says Pruneau . Now , when the man is pressured to attend an insurgent shura , or meeting , he passes on the information to Pruneau . <p> So the patrol is , in part , to maintain a valuable relationship . It also demonstrates power . " The local population will go with who is strongest , " says Pruneau . By walking through Taliban country , the Canadians are asserting they are stronger than the Taliban , and they are daring the insurgents to try to prove them wrong . Finally , the joint patrol is an opportunity for the Afghan soldiers partnered with the Canadians to assume more leadership in security operations . <p> During Pruneau 's briefing , Afghan National Army Lieut . Mohammed Mir speaks up . " If there is a family in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search it , " he says through a translator . " We know the language and the people , and it 's our job . " " That 's why we 're glad you 're here , " says Pruneau . " We 'll stay back and only come if you call for our help . " <p> Later , Pruneau describes the Afghan soldiers he works with as competent , if unpolished . " When we look at them , we think they should n't carry their weapons that way , " he says . " But they do n't need to look professional . They show professionalism by their actions . " As an example , Pruneau says he 's recently given responsibility for the nearby town of Bazar-e-Panjwaii , largest in the district with a population of about 5,000 , to the Afghan National Army . " I do n't patrol there anymore , " he says . During Pruneau 's previous deployment in 2006-2007 , shops in Bazar-e-Panjwaii were shuttered . The town is now bustling . " People tell us they 've come back because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Panjwaii has also impacted Canada 's efforts to win over Afghan civilians in the district . Civilian Military Co-operation ( CIMIC ) teams are attached to the battle group . Their job is to bring aid and development , providing jobs and hopefully building a link between local residents and their government . <p> There are more CIMIC operators than during previous deployments , and their efforts are decentralized . CIMIC operators are assigned to each company , which means projects are run by soldiers in direct daily contact with people who live in the district . Maj. Daniel Lamoureux , commanding officer of CIMIC for Task Force Kandahar , describes the teams as " another weapons system for a company commander . " <p> Maj. Jean-Christian Marquis , who currently commands Crazy Company of the Van Doos ' battle group , says he did n't have CIMIC at his disposal as an infantry commander during his last tour , in 2007 . " It did n't make sense . Everyone was hiding , and the only people we 'd meet were insurgents . " Marquis now works out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salavat . He says when he arrived in November , residents would throw rocks at his soldiers . The Taliban had murdered the village leader , or malik , three years earlier . Then his son , Musa Khalim , only 24 years old , returned to the village from Kandahar city and declared himself malik . He also said he would work with the Canadians . <p> " I promised myself I would make my village better , " Khalim says during an interview that takes place when a Canadian patrol stops to visit him at an Afghan police outpost near Salavat . " I talked to my family . I told them if I die on this job , one of my brothers should take over . The Canadians have a good attitude and they provide support projects for the people . I have been threatened so many times by the Taliban . I do n't care . I want to improve my village . " Khalim says about 10 per cent of the people in Salavat support the Taliban , some because they want to , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In April , the Canadians opened a school in the village . It 's located in a compound that used to be a base for the Afghan National Army . The soldiers there agreed to leave after the Canadians built them an entire new camp elsewhere . The school 's principal is 22 years old . Instructors , teenagers themselves , come in from Kandahar city every morning to teach math , Pashtun culture , Islam , reading and writing . The Afghan Ministry of Education pays their salaries . The battle group 's CIMIC team funded jobs to repair the compound buildings . No students arrived the first day it opened . The next morning there were about 20 . Now more than 200 regularly attend . <p> Today there are at least eight schools open in Panjwaii district . Last August , there was one . There are more than 30 schools open in neighbouring Dand district . Less than a year ago there were 15 . <p> The Salavat school is n't a flawless success . Only boys attend . One morning , a father brought his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his three sons , but the girls never returned . Marquis suspects the father had hoped other fathers would send their girls , and when they would n't the man was afraid to leave his daughters at the school alone . Students who study there mostly belong to the same tribe . Children from a different tribe who live closer to the school do n't come . " For us , it is to give them the tools , " says CIMIC team leader Capt . Nick Paquet . " Then it is an Afghan process . " <p> The battle group has pushed a paved road through what was once Taliban-controlled territory in the Horn of Panjwaii . Known as " Highway Hyena , " it allows Canadian and Afghan soldiers to move quickly throughout the district . Travelling the 70 km or so from the Masum Ghar outpost to the highway 's end used to take all day , and can now be done in about an hour . Taliban strength picks up where the road stops . <p> Canadian soldiers hope the highway will also help farmers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give them an alternative to fighting for the Taliban for a few dollars a day -- or growing poppies , which provide the Taliban with much of their revenue . Poppy fields still bloom everywhere in Panjwaii , including directly below at least one Afghan police station . Zarar Ahmad Moqbel , Afghanistan 's minister of counter-narcotics , says his government eradicates poppy fields when it can provide farmers with a better alternative . This does n't appear to be the case in Panjwaii , where security is fragile and infrastructure is poor . <p> The Canadians , for the most part , stay out of it . Maj. Eric Landry of the 12th Armoured Regiment of Canada , whose soldiers helped build the highway , says Afghan police found an enormous cache of marijuana and opium near the terminus of Highway Hyena . The police burned it , he says . " But they kept a sample for themselves . " <p> The battle group also tries " psy-ops , " or psychological operations , to persuade locals to shun insurgents . Capt . Braden Greaves , an information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from using " black-ops , " meaning deception or intentional misinformation , in this campaign . Pamphlets they publish criticizing the Taliban must indicate that they originate with ISAF or the local Afghan government . " We do n't lie , " he says . " What we try to do is present the truth in a way that is favourable to us . " <p> Greaves helps run a radio station out of Bazar-e-Panjwaii . It employs two local DJs and two reporters , and features news , music and poetry . It 's also a way for local and national government officials to speak to citizens of Panjwaii , who otherwise have little contact with their government . The Canadian army controls the content . " We 're not trying to hide anything from the population , " he says . A recent Taliban attack on Kandahar city was covered , for example , but the focus was on the fact that Afghan security forces repelled it , and that the insurgents had used suicide bombers -- a tactic Muslim scholars have condemned . <p> Canadians in Kandahar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice . They ca n't force Afghans to reject the Taliban , but they can provide an alternative . <p> " As long as we 're here , our work should be to create an option , " says Capt . Alexis Legros , who commands a platoon at the Folad patrol base . " They chose the Taliban because they provided security . Now we 're giving them another choice . In the end it will be the population that decides . They know the Taliban closed schools and we opened one . There 's no point trying to impose anything , because it wo n't work . The only thing we can do is give them time and an alternative when we leave . " <p> That the Canadians are leaving the south complicates the choices Afghans living there will make . <p> Few Afghans -- and few senior members of ISAF -- fault the Canadians for ending their combat mission in Kandahar . " Canada has been in a very tough area . They have contributed a lot to the security of this country . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abdul Rahim Wardak . <p> " They have not given up , " Wardak continues . " They are trying to train and prepare the Afghan national security forces . And we all believe the only sustainable way to secure Afghanistan is to enable the Afghans themselves . What we really did n't want is that anyone 's blood should be sacrificed here to defend and secure us . And the sooner we fulfill our historic responsibility to secure and defend this country , I think we will be restoring our historic honour and pride . We really do n't want to be a burden on the international community forever . Canada has been a good friend and ally . We are highly indebted to the Canadian people and their government . And I think they have demonstrated the highest degree of soldiering and professionalism , and they have represented Canada with honour and dignity and gallantry . " <p> Yet Canada is leaving the south before the area is fully secure . The country has paid an enormous cost in blood and treasure there already , and one might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the Americans and British to declare an end to combat this summer and decrease their troop contributions by more than half , NATO 's mission in Afghanistan would collapse . <p> In the short term , the gap left by Canada 's departure from Kandahar will be filled by American and , increasingly , Afghan soldiers . Afghan Sgt.-Maj . Ali Urozgani , partnered with Canadian soldiers in Panjwaii , believes Afghans will be ready to stand on their own . " The training the Canadian mentors have provided us has been very helpful , " he says . " Also , the Americans are coming . Even without the Americans I think we 'll be okay , " <p> Eventually the Americans will go , too . Then the decisions faced by Afghans in Kandahar will come down to a choice between the Taliban and their own army and government . <p> There are reasons to worry . The Taliban and other insurgent groups still have sanctuary across the border in Pakistan , and Pakistani madrasas , or religious schools , continue to churn out recruits . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem . <p> It 's also far from certain that Afghanistan will have a government that deserves the loyalty of its population . The 2009 presidential election that returned Hamid Karzai to power was not free and fair , and similar corruption persists throughout all levels of Afghanistan 's government . One senior Western official who works closely with the Afghan government describes corruption in state institutions as " very extensive . " He says some Afghan leaders understand that corruption is " a potentially fatal threat to the state " and are trying to end it . Ultimately , however , like so much of Afghanistan 's future , there 's a limited amount that he and other non-Afghans can do about it . <p> It raises the question of how much of the progress that Canada and its allies have fought for and earned in Kandahar is sustainable . What will remain when they go ? <p> The Saidon patrol base is a tiny outpost in what was once the Taliban 's backyard . It guards a village and road . There is a mulberry tree in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ netting for shade , and a couple of mud-walled rooms that do n't appear to have lights . On the roof are the flags of Canada and the Royal 22e R ? giment . There 's also a .50 calibre machine gun . Behind it is a battered easy chair where anyone firing the gun might sit . <p> The soldiers stationed here stay for two or three weeks at a time , patrolling constantly through nearby villages , sometimes with Afghan soldiers who live in a neighbouring compound . Pte . Tommy Quiron , 24 , says he prefers life in a small outpost because " we 're free to do what we want , " but says conditions are more comfortable on the larger bases . He has a tattoo on his shoulder : " In peace , vigilance . In war , victory . In death , sacrifice . " <p> The walk to get to Saidon from a nearby forward operating base is hot . All the soldiers carry 70 or 80 lb. of gear , including a ballistic vest , weapons , water , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stands in the centre of the base , guzzling warm water from a plastic bottle . Powdery dust kicked up by marching soldiers sticks to the sweat on his face , forming smears of white against his sunburned skin . He 's smiling . <p> " It has to be brought down to small victories , " he says , when asked what the Canadians have accomplished that will outlast them . " It has to be brought down to a 10-year-old going to school . When he was born he could n't listen to music or study anything other than the Quran . Now that 10-year-old has a choice . <p> " So what 's our legacy ? That 10-year-old was born in a very different world . It was a radical extremist government that allowed its country to be used for terrorism . That 10-year-old today has more choices . He has a school .

@@4208234 <h> Hockey Hall of Fame referee Andy Van Hellemond is suing the creators of the comic strip Adam@Home and numerous newspapers , including the Star , for libel . <p> In 25 seasons as an NHL referee , Andy Van Hellemond absorbed nightly doses of in-game profanity and at least a couple of punches . <p> But even his time-thickened skin has its limits . When newspapers across North America ran a comic strip last month that referred to Van Hellemond as " the worst and most evil ref ever , " Van Hellemond hired a lawyer . The creators of the strip , Adam@Home , and numerous newspapers that published it , including the Star , have since been served with notices of Van Hellemond 's intention to sue for libel . <p> " Our position is that the statement , that someone 's ' the worst and most evil , ' is a libellous statement , " Gavin Tighe , Van Hellemond 's lawyer , said this week . " You talk about evil , Adolf Hitler jumps to mind . Or Satan . ... Here 's a guy whose entire career was based on integrity and fairness being called evil . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hellemond , who has n't refereed an NHL game since his 1996 retirement from the ice , was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1999 . He retired as the NHL 's director of officials in 2004 . A city councillor in Guelph since being elected in the fall , he declined comment . <p> The four-panel strip in question , which ran in numerous newspapers , including the Boston Globe , consists of a back and forth between a father and a son . In the first panel , the son asks his father , " Think I could be an NHL ref ? " Replies the father : " If Van Hellemond could do it , anyone can . " <p> The son wonders : " Who 's Van Hellemond ? " <p> " Some say the worst and most evil ref ever , " the father replies . <p> Experts on libel law were divided on the merits of Van Hellemond 's potential case . Jamie Cameron , a professor at Osgoode Hall law school , said she would be " surprised if the lawsuit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strip might not have been very funny , but that does not make it defamatory , " Cameron wrote in an email . " The law of defamation has the common sense to recognize that comic strips and cartoons are not taken at face value . " <p> Dean Jobb , an associate professor at the University of King 's College in Halifax who has written a book on media law , said there " is latitude given to parody , " but that it does n't necessarily leave the writer of a comic strip impervious to accusations of defamation . <p> " I do n't know what will ultimately come of ( Van Hellemond 's libel notice ) , but my feeling , from my study of libel law , is that it will be a tough defence , " said Jobb . " You 'll have to show this as either justified or true . ... When you get the superlative ' the worst ' and ' most evil , ' that 's harder to prove . " <p> Van Tighe said that Van Hellemond , who won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been asked about the comic strip by " many " of his constituents . <p> " They 're asking , ' Why are they calling you evil ? ' That 's a good question and I do n't know the answer to the question , " Van Tighe said . " I do n't know who writes this cartoon . I do n't think they play hockey . Maybe they did . Maybe ( Van Hellemond ) made a call against them . " <p> Exactly who wrote the comic remains unknown . The masthead credits Adam@Home to Brian Basset and Rob Harrell . Basset said in an email that he retired from creating the strip 2 ? years ago to focus on another strip . Basset added that Harrell is currently recovering from a badly broken leg . <p> " Guest cartoonists have been filling in for him , " said Basset . <p> A spokesman for the company that syndicates the strip , Universal Uclick , refused comment in an email but confirmed that Basset and Harrell had been served with notices of Van Hellemond 's intention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Star . <p> " In 35 years I 've never seen a matter like this emanate from the comics page . It 's bizarre , " Murdoch Davis , the Star 's executive editor , wrote in an email . " The Star feels that Canadian law on comment protects this , as far as whether it is defamation . However , as Public Editor Kathy English says in her column today , it falls short of our own standards of fairness , which is quite different from defamation . It was stupid and unfair and we regret publishing it . But we do n't think a libel action is the appropriate way to address it . Our readers know what the comics are , and what they are n't . This was not a statement by the Star , but by a fictional character . " <p> Cartoonists have been sued for libel in the past . In one memorable instance Bill Vander Zalm , then British Columbia 's minister of human resources , filed suit after a 1978 editorial cartoon depicted him sadistically pulling the wings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time when Vander Zalm was being criticized for his social policies , ultimately failed . <p> Van Hellemond has certainly been the brunt of severe slings from some of hockey 's most notorious sadists . Bobby Clarke , the foul-mouthed leader of Philadelphia 's infamous Broad Street Bullies , once referred to Van Hellemond with a word so offensive that Don Cherry , telling the story in one of his memoirs , refused to publish the insult . When Van Hellemond was n't being spackled with profanity he was occasionally the target of punches ; the 1981-82 season alone saw him hit by the respective right hands of players Paul Holmgren and Terry O'Reilly . <p> " I 'm sure he 's ( taken ) worse on the ice , but not published in the newspaper like this , " Tighe said . " I think ' evil ' has a connotation that 's beyond expletives . Someone like Paul Bernardo is described as evil . It 's a character assassination with no context . This is a bolt from the blue . What 's this about ? ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're referred to with them , it 's just not onside . " <p> The comic strip , too , tries its hand at a play on hockey terminology . In the third panel the son , whose interest in the legend of Van Hellemond is piqued , asks the father : " How bad was he ? " The father replies : " So bad he could n't see ' icing ' on a cupcake.

Around them , gnarled trees shot up and slammed together overhead , blocking the moon and stars . The wind did n't bluster and blow like city wind . Here it whispered and moaned and shrieked .

@@4211238 <p> A new planning blueprint for revitalizing the tired retail strip on Yonge Street north of Dundas envisions sidewalk cafes and street vendors , mid-rise buildings and heritage storefronts and one lane less in each direction for traffic on the city 's main drag . <p> The privately funded study will be unveiled Wednesday by local Councillor Kristyn Wong-Tam after consultations with residents and businesses .

Canada 's self-respect , international reputation and foreign-policy independence were casualties of what former top soldier Rick Hillier termed the " decade of darkness .

Helicopters offered a surefire way around the IED threat for certain types of missions through reduced reliance on ground transport and exposure on the roads .

It was symbolic of the cost of letting our military slide . <p> As the nightly news filled with images of young Canadians dying in Afghanistan , and stories about our great deeds there became known to the public , Canadians stopped debating whether the investments in tanks , choppers and improved armoured vehicles were worth it . Our soldiers needed them , the government provided them . The public approved .

Vital lessons of Afghanistan will easily become distant memories . But this will not render our military any less important or relevant . <p> The world is a dangerous place .

@@4213240 <h> Calgary Flames 2011 draft review <h> Share this story <p> After just failing to make the playoffs with a strong second half push , the Calgary Flames started a new era under the leadership of Jay Feaster who was recently made the official general manager . He replaces Darryl Sutter who resigned on December 28th , 2011 after eight years with the Flames organization . Feaster has already said that the team 's identity will go back to being a hard working team that is very difficult to play against . <p> In their first entry draft under Feaster , with only five selections , the Flames chose to address their minor league scoring issues by taking three highly skilled offensive forwards . Calgary also added to their organization 's all-round depth by drafting a defensive defenseman and a big goalie . <p> Baertschi was the right choice for the Flames as he addresses their needs for impact scoring forwards . Feaster was very happy to get his man and the player was clearly happy to be chosen by the Calgary Flames and to have the possibility to play for a Canadian team . The Flames ' general manager indicated that Baertschi was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play all the forward positions but the most important quality was his remarkable work ethic . The rookie forward was known for being the first player on the ice for the Winterhawks ' practices and after the team had finished , he would stay on the ice to work on his shooting , moves and skating footwork for an extra 45 minutes . His coaches would occasionally have to ask him to get off the ice . The 18-year-old Swiss forward has a low powerful skating style which allows him to hold his ground and not get knocked around by bigger players while playing in the high traffic areas . The dynamic forward must increase his muscle mass , gain some more weight , and improve his strength along the boards to play at the NHL level . Baertschi acknowledged he has lots to work to do both on and off the ice to make the Flames and play in the NHL . <p> The freshman forward scored 34 goals ( 11 on the power play ) with 51 assists and a plus-23 rating in 66 WHL games . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , scoring ten goals with 17 assists in 21 games . The highly skilled forward was nominated for the WHL rookie of the year award and played for Team Orr in the 2011 Home Hardware CHL/NHL Top Prospects game . <p> Baertschi will most likely be returned back to Portland for another year at the WHL level to continue improving his game . <p> The Flames chose another highly skilled offensive forward with the first of their two second round picks received in the trade of Tim Erixon to the Rangers . Granlund has good hockey sense , excellent playmaking abilities and sees the ice well . All of the young centerman 's assets helped him to score 20 goals with 32 assists in 40 games , an excellent season for HIJK , averaging 1.32 points per game . The rookie forward was the league 's third best scorer despite being two years younger than most of the players in the Finnish Junior " A " League . The 18-year-old centerman was exceptional at running the power play but needs to improve his overall strength while maturing into his body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Granlund will most likely remain in Finland for a couple more years . He will watch closely what his older brother , Mikael ( MIN ) , does after completing Finland 's mandatory military service requirements . <p> Wotherspoon was the other second round pick from the Erixon trade to the Rangers . The Flames are getting an effective shutdown defenseman who plays a simple , low risk and solid defensive game . The second year defenseman scored only two goals with ten assists and an even rating while collecting 73 penalty minutes ( three fighting majors ) in 63 WHL games . The 18-year-old will need to work on adding more to his offensive game and using his NHL size to his advantage by playing more physically with the body . <p> Expect Wotherspoon to play at least one if not two more seasons at the CHL level before joining the Flames professionally . <p> The Flames stepped way outside the box with this high risk but high reward draft pick . Gaudreau has really quick hands , shifty moves , explosive speed and this really small centerman could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and big time skill to prove the doubters wrong about his size . The teenager can make bigger players look foolish when they miss trying to check him . If they are able to make contact with him , then he has such excellent edge control with his skates , he can slide off and around the checker . The smallish center needs to add muscle mass and weight to be able to play at the more physical NHL level but he has time to mature . Gaudreau has scored goals at every level of hockey as he 's a pure scorer which is an asset that ca n't be taught . <p> The 17-year-old centerman was named the USHL Rookie of the year and also named to the All-Rookie Team when he scored 36 goals ( second in the USHL ) with 36 assists while playing all 60 USHL games . His Dubuque Fighting Saints won the Clark Cup as Champions of the USHL this season . <p> The young centerman has a commitment to go to Northeastern University this year but the resignation of the Head Coach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coaching staff , has caused the player and his family to weigh out all their options . Gaudreau 's options are : attend Northeastern , ask for a withdrawal of intent and sign with another college if granted the withdrawal , return back to play for Dubuque , sign with the Calgary Flames , or sign with a CHL team . What his decision will be , has yet to be announced . <p> No matter which of these options the outstanding scorer choses to pursue , it will be worth watching to see how he progresses in his hockey career . Gaudreau was picked by the right team because the Flames have given smaller players like Theo Fleury and Martin St. Louis the chance to play in the NHL , but he must still prove them right . <p> This draft selection by the Flames is a development project as the young netminder clearly has raw untapped talent . Brossoit started the year as the back-up goalie for the Edmonton Oil Kings but progressed enough to supplant the number one goaltender , Jon Groenheyde , as the starter by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be returning to the WHL for his sophomore season as the probable number one netminder . The big goalie recorded 13 wins ( two shutouts ) with 12 losses while sporting a goals against average of 3.32 and .887 save percentage for the defensively weak Oil Kings . The 18-year-old netminder showed poise , a calm demeanour , determination and quick reflexes . The young talent will need more work on his positioning , timing when dropping into butterfly and his cross crease lateral speed . <p> Brossoit could turn out to be a solid goaltender if the Flames are able to bring him along slowly and develop that raw talent to its fullest potential . He adds the needed depth to their goaltending position .

" <p> Current estimates of the value of global annual agricultural production provided by natural crop-pollinators are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monetary value to the pollination service is the first step in establishing a protocol for protecting its workers . The logic goes that if people realize the labour value of bees , bats , birds , beetles , and butterflies , policy-makers will be likelier to develop better environmental and agricultural policies . <p> Any alternative to natural pollinators -- such as having untold numbers of human beings manually spread pollen with paintbrushes and Q-tips -- would be economically unfeasible , not to mention physically implausible . <p> With a decline in bee populations , McCavour called for major changes in pollination and agriculture practices . <p> The European honey bee has long been credited with bearing the bulk of the pollination burden , but there are actually more than 20,000 separate bee species which spread pollen , along with a host of other winged creatures . <p> Among the most effective are Africanized bees , which provide a 50 per cent higher produce yield than standard apiary honey bees . However , there are common fears about introducing the non-native species . <p> McCavour wants to challenge those fears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " McCavour later explained in an interview . <p> If insects are considered contributors to an overall pollination service , she said losing a species is not necessarily a bad thing if the new species does the same , or a better , job . <p> Lessons learned from using a variety of pollinators can also be applied when sowing the crops themselves -- including the lesson that diversity is good . <p> Experimental agricultural plantations have revealed that farming an array of food crops side by side will result in a higher overall produce yield due to variations in the pollinators they will attract . <p> This is in direct opposition to the current practice of wide-scale orchard plantations , which may be contributing to the alarming decline of the honey bee population in North America . <p> California 's almond growers occupy more than 800,000 acres and produce 80 per cent of the world 's almond crops .

" They 're out on the road from February until the fall . " <p> Pollination of the almond crop in the California agricultural belt uses virtually every available commercially owned honey bee in the United States -- and McCavour says it 's still not enough . <p> She suggests a simple solution : designating strips of land within the plantations to diversify the crops would attract wild pollinators to the area and reduce the honey bees ' workload , she says . <p> Another roadblock to work out under NAFTA is the use of pesticides -- specifically neonicotinoids -- which are harmful to both bees and bats . <p> The Environmental Protection Agency had approved their use but the state of New York challenged the ruling and won , rendering pesticides containing the ingredient illegal in the United States . However , they can still be legally obtained in Mexico and Canada . <p> " It creates a lot of problems when you 're trying to come up with a cohesive pollinator protection plan that applies to the three countries , " said McCavour . <p> Though McCavour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she does n't believe we need to continually preserve the exact same species .

" <p> She said colony collapse is only a critical issue for farmers as long as they depend solely on one species for pollination -- suggesting that even the most productive company might benefit from a diversified workforce .

" <p> Howell 's case may not have been able to tell the jury what Tippett did to injury Tameron , but it did set the scene for the jury to believe that Tippett was the only person who had the opportunity to have hurt the child , including that Tippett may have had a momentary lapse in judgement brought about by mounting frustrations that fateful afternoon . <p> " Any case involving the death of a child is always a difficult case on a number of levels in terms of the evidence that has to be called and obviously the emotional aspect that comes with that kind of a case , " said Howell . <p> The Crown attorney said getting a conviction in a case involving circumstantial evidence is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an alternative approach compared to when there is direct evidence available . <p> " Circumstantial evidence is , as the judge explained ( to the jury ) , evidence like any other evidence , " said Howell .

@@4220233 <h> Rex Murphy : Newfoundland moose cull could help take the gas out of emissions <p> I have had reason , in an earlier column , to call attention to the extravagant growth of Newfoundland 's moose population . There is no question they are a randy bunch , as jaded as mink and as prolific as rabbits . In recent years , the population has vastly increased . Whether there are now more moose than Newfoundlanders is a sad and open question . Newfoundland 's problem comes however , not from the moose 's carnal virtuosity and reproductive efficiency so much as from their -- let me be direct -- stupidity and sheer bulk . They are as large as freight trains and stupid as a stump . Moose cross roads and highways . They ignore the signs . They seem to think the Trans Canada Highway , which in a manner bisects the provinces , is some sort of private and paved moose path . They ignore all oncoming traffic -- a bus means as little to the average dumb moose as a bicycle . As a result , they collide with motorists -- I do n't think it 's too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend of mine , in less than a month , has had one car totalled , its successor very badly damaged , and the " rental " he was given while number-two car was being repaired suffered a collision three or four days ago . Three hits in fewer than three weeks . Suffice to say he had the " emissions " quite scared out of him . All of this , by the way , within a four-kilometre span of highway . <p> What to do , has till now -- for I have a proposal to make -- eluded the depths of even Newfoundlanders ' famed ingenuity . <p> This brings me to Australia , which has a population of wild or feral camels almost one-million strong . Camels are among the most prodigious " flatulators " on the planet . It is not a good thing , weeping and nearly blind Australians assure us , to be downwind when either one camel or ( God save the mark ) a whole bunch of them , decide to pass gas . And such gas : not just carbon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas . Indeed , the rear end of the wild Australian camel in full flatulent mode is ( according to Aussie greens ) bringing the world dangerously close to a global-warming apocalypse . <p> The Australians ' idea is to shoot the camels to save the planet . A company called Northwest Carbon has proposed the notion , utilizing helicopters to maximize the cull . The head of that company ( his own words can not be bettered ) " calculates that each of the feral dromedaries roaming Australia 's mostly desolate interior belches or farts out no less than 45kg of methane each year , equating in global-warming terms to a thumping ton of CO2 . On average , each camel assassination will prevent the lifelong equivalent of 15 tonnes of carbon emissions . " Under Australia 's latest green scheme , the shooter would then be eligible to receive a carbon trading certificate , which is easily monetized . The prospect of green money for doing in the feral camel will no doubt ignite all serious environmentalists in Australia to bring out their guns and rent a helicopter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a source of flatulence the Newfoundland moose can make any claim to be in the same league as the Aussie dromedary . For the sake of all my fellow Newfoundlanders , I truly hope it is not . But it is vegetarian -- eats leaves and stuff -- so we know it 's gassy . <p> So let us take a page from progressive Australia , and put the moose to the gun for the sake of our common planet . And , incidentally , reduce the pileups on the TransCanada and minimize the threat to innocent tourists . <p> Thank you Australia . Thank you greens . Your example is a light unto the nations , and every wickedly flatulent camel 's greatest nightmare .

Seminal works -- such as These Waves of Girls , a hypertext short story about a car accident , created in 1987 ; or Shelly Jackson 's Patchwork Girl , a feminist retelling of the Frankenstein story , published in 1995 -- established the new field of electronic fiction , and the issue of authorial control has been hotly debated ever since . <p> " You get these interactive projects -- it 's such a novelty , the first 20 minutes the person is just learning the interface , " says Alex Jansen , the owner of Pop Sandbox , a small digital publisher that produced The Next Day and will turn to fiction with a forthcoming photo novella based on a short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith .

Simple tasks like typing become harder , as do tasks that require significant cognitive input , such as public speaking . <p> Mental acuity is also greatly affected by changes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living on coffee , during a vigorous day are literally not smart . The body secretes cortisol hormone as a response to physical stress ( such as starvation ) , which in turn stimulates insulin secretion . A carbohydrate , or ' sugar , ' craving ensues . If you give in to the temptation of a chocolate bar or a candy jar , these types of carbohydrates quickly metabolize into blood sugar , which rises for 60 to 90 minutes . During this spike , research shows that concrete and abstract memory recall , word fluency and reading speed all become impaired . To make matters worse , if this junk-food fuel is not all used up for physical activity , it gets stored in the form of body fat . Those cups of coffee you 're drinking with a bagel or muffin also stimulate cortisol . <p> So the next time you walk into a meeting and feel like your heart is racing , you ca n't articulate exactly what you want to say and have trouble writing down what you 're hearing , ask yourself : Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you dumb and fat -- it 's that simple . So follow the long-standing advice : Make sure you eat three meals a day . Balance those meals with the right amounts of carbohydrates ( 40% to 45% ) , ideally complex ones such as multi-grain bread , oatmeal , fruits and vegetables . Snack only on plain nuts and seeds . Balance the sugar peaks and valleys by adding proteins ( 25% to 35% ) and lean fats ( 10% to 20% ) to each meal . This formula will provide your body with five to six hours of steady energy it needs to keep you at high performance .

The two-week program is set to wrap up today ( July 15 ) . <p> After initially telling her no one had applied to serve as Emilio 's in-class teacher 's assistant ( TA ) - only to later confirm his mother 's claim that the two people who have served in that role during the school year had applied -a school district official told her Emilio had been excluded because the summer school program would not be a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> However , on Friday ( July 8 ) , school officials relented and told Pam Razzano that Emilio could participate , she said . <p> School district officials could not be reached for comment on the reasons for the change .

" We should n't have to go to these lengths . " <p> On July 5 , Razzano said she recognizes that not every school program is suitable for her son . However , district officials had yet to explain what aspects of the program would not be safe for him to participate in . <p> " I as a parent would never put him in a program that I know would cause him harm but I would think that school programs and education are not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an email for verification what they feel in the program would be unsafe for him , I receive nothing - no itinerary nor any explanation .

" <p> Faith Bodnar , executive director of the B.C. Association for Community Living ( BCCLA ) , agreed that society in general , and public institutions more specifically , have a responsibility to be as inclusive as possible . <p> While most B.C. school districts have Ministry of Education-guided policies surrounding inclusiveness , there 's nothing in the School Act or other legislation that requires school districts to include special-needs students , either during the school year or in summer school programs , Bodnar said . <p> The BCCLA is in favour of having such requirements ensconced in legislation , she said . Failing that , she suggested that the Ministry provide incentives for school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their programs fully inclusive . <p> At the moment , it 's up to individual school boards to decide how best to incorporate special-needs students into their programs . " I would hope that they would follow good practices and be dedicated to pursue desirable outcomes for all students , " Bodnar said . <p> Emilio and his family have been overcoming challenges since the day he was born -May 1 , 2003 . As an infant , he was diagnosed with hypoplastic left heart syndrome and underwent three open-heart surgeries and countless trips to the hospital for treatment . The community rallied to support several successful fundraisers to help the family meet the financial burdens brought on by Emilio 's medical condition . <p> His deafness was diagnosed when he was 18 months old , and he also suffers from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) and moderate brain damage that resulted from a stroke that followed one of his early surgeries . <p> Pam Razzano , though , said her son is nonetheless still in the mainstream school system and could use the extra help provided by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She said she signed Emilio up for the same program in 2010 , only to be told there was no money in the budget to pay his interpreter/TA .

Americans should also not overlook the critical issue of civil , political , and economic freedoms .

They are embedded in Canada 's consciousness in a way we have n't seen since the Korean War , " said Col. ( Ret . ) Brian MacDonald , senior analyst with the Conference of Defence Associations . <p> " That connection was lost around 1966 , when the military dropped its presence on Canadian campuses . The Forces lost contact with the people , to a large extent . <p> " But now we have a Highway of Heroes running into the heart of our cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bridges . It 's a striking change . " <p> As they come home , the Canadian Forces also find themselves kitted as well , or better , than many of their NATO peers . A self-contained , modernized army , replete with the once-missing pieces -- Chinook helicopters and a fleet of four massive CC-177 Globemaster aircraft -- for whatever comes next . <p> What might that be ? And what sort of work might they do when they get there ? It depends on whom you ask . <p> To the military 's sharpest critics , the legacy of these last 10 years includes an acute absence of debate as the army shed its " peacekeeping " image . <p> " I view it as a fight for the soul of Canada and the way we view the world -- and the fight continues , " said Steven Staples , who has locked horns with Canada 's military brass from his perch as president of the Ottawa-based Rideau Institute , an independent research and advocacy group . <p> " The abandonment of peacekeeping arguably started pre-9/11 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since . <p> " But the massive increase in Canada 's military spending has come with a massive expansion of the military 's political power in Ottawa . . . There is plenty more money and power in play , but not nearly enough questions about what we want the Canadian Forces to be doing on Canada 's behalf . " <p> Staples readily acknowledges Canadians are now " more aware and supportive of soldiers . " But he suggests the transformation came about , in part , by design , courtesy of the Department of National Defence headquarters in Ottawa . <p> " I 'm not saying it is a fa ? ade . There is a very real increase in people attending Nov. 11 ceremonies . But the military spends millions in public relations campaigns and that , in part , is what delivers its political clout . So how much of this is a legitimate shift and how much of it is very well-crafted emblems for the media to cover . I 'm not sure . " <p> One especially outspoken critic is Col. ( Ret . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Kandahar in 2002 . Today , he doubts the Canadian Forces have actually changed as much as some believe . Neither , he says , has Canada . <p> When Stogran landed in early 2002 , the Kandahar Airfield that would eventually grow into a veritable NATO city , with Tim Hortons double-doubles and a ball-hockey rink , was a burned-out wasteland mired in ankle-deep dust . <p> But nearby Kandahar City was then a place where foreign journalists could tread unhindered , even after nightfall . One encountered grinning Pashtun tribesmen everywhere , not only delighted to be free of austere Taliban rule but anticipating their lives were about to be transformed for the better by these welcome outsiders . <p> Stogran , who was ousted from his later position as Canada 's Veterans Ombudsman for being too adamant on behalf of vets , returned to Kandahar three months ago as a civilian . He came away with deep misgivings -- convinced Canadians have effectively " lost " the war , yet immensely proud of what rank-and-file soldiers made of the impossible task they were handed . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they never lost a single tactical engagement . They truly are worthy of every scrap of praise Canadians can offer , " Stogran told the Star . <p> " But in my view , the generals let down the troops with a flawed strategy . Instead of focusing on building up Kandahar , economically and diplomatically , we ended up just blindly going in and started whacking Taliban . " <p> Canada 's charismatic former top soldier , Gen. Rick Hillier , is widely regarded as the key to the Canadian Forces rebranding . The shoot-from-the-hip Newfoundlander seemed , midway through the 9/11 decade , to have achieved a rare fusion with Canadian popular opinion . <p> But Hillier 's hawkish rhetoric -- like his famed denunciation of the Taliban as " scumbags and murderers " -- came with a battle posture that " did more to disadvantage Canadian Forces in the longer term anything else , " said Stogran . <p> " Hillier lost the war with Vietnam-style tactics . We should have been there like a police force . We did n't need tanks , we needed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs . Instead , we ended up clawing over and killing a lot of Afghan civilians in the rush to get at the bad guys . <p> " The U.S. will declare victory , undoubtedly , and pull out in 2014 . And by 2016 , probably , the bubble will break like Saigon . It 's a travesty . " <p> There was a time , Stogran admits , when he resented the " Canadian peacekeeper " label , because the frontline-troop reality in past missions to places such as Bosnia , Somalia and Rwanda never matched the myth . <p> " I hated the word ' peacekeeper ' when I got back from Bosnia because it implied some sort of bloodless offering with no real danger .. . . It was war , and yet a soldier injured in the line of duty was supposedly no more than an industrial accident , " said Stogran . <p> " But when I left Afghanistan , I found myself with a new appreciation for our ' peacekeeping ' legacy because what we were facing in Kandahar , I would submit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's where the lessons learned are going to be important . Because in this new security environment we live in , if the future is about winning hearts and minds , Canada has the potential to be a superpower . As long as we do n't believe in flexing our muscles to kill people . " <p> The other paradox throughout the 9/11 years has been access -- an unprecedented flow of journalists to the front lines , even as the flow of information tightened with each passing year . <p> Simple questions that once prompted immediate answers began to drag out into multi-day delays , as public affairs officers on the ground passed the query up the food chain for approval from Ottawa . <p> It 's a dynamic familiar to Sharon Hobson , one of Canada 's longest-serving defence correspondents , who has written for Jane 's Defence Weekly since 1985 . Hobson , who sits on the advisory council of the Canadian Defence and Foreign Affairs Institute , says the information flow from DND HQ has tightened to a trickle . <p> OPSEC -- or operational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on basic queries . But unlike many of Canada 's NATO allies , the long shadow of OPSEC extends to the wounded , with the extent of injuries in recent years a de facto state secret . <p> U.S. forces , by contrast , update casualty counts once a month , while the U.K. freshens its tally of killed and injured in Afghanistan every two weeks . Canada is not expected to reveal its number of wounded for 2011 until early next year . And we may never know how badly the survivors were hurt . <p> OPSEC also stretches like a blanket over Joint Task Force 2 , Canada 's special forces , a unit that is widely believed to have seen more action since 9/11 than any other . But the elite team , which doubled in size to approximately 600 , has never been glimpsed in the field . Or rather , those among us who 've seen them have never been allowed , under the terms of embedding , to write about it . <p> Says Hobson : " Of course we all understand the obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But what about six months or a year later , when the mission is long over ? We should know the kinds of things they are engaging in . It can be done because other countries do it . We just do n't do it here . <p> " Now with the embedding program , the irony is there are more reporters than ever getting to know something about the military -- but you ca n't get detailed information like before . You rarely get interviews . Instead , what you get is an email with bullet points approved by the Privy Council Office and very general . We used to be let in on the big picture . Now you just get fragments . " <p> Which , argues Hobson , is not merely an occupational annoyance . Our ability as citizens to weigh in on Canada 's military future is at risk . <p> " The Canadian public needs to know what the Canadian military is doing in its name .

It was the Good , the Bad vs Zombies , like some other zombie movies I 've seen , just with a clearer line of separation with the Bad being drug lords in an almost abandoned building . And there was a very big cliche bit at the end- the lone idiot on top of a car- seen in previews- smacking around zombies , which finally pulled him off after about 5 minutes of his yelling and screaming like He-Man getting an anal probe ? ? ? I did n't see any depth to the characters either- You killed my friend , I 'll kill you , but zombies got in the way ( sort of ) . The movie was predictable and just a big pile of Meh . <p> I thought La Horde was a fantastic little flick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't seen before , but the performances were good , the zombies looked cool , the terror felt real enough . Sure , a bit cliche , but still fun all the way . Great review , Meh ! <p> Technically , they were n't " zombies " in 28 Days Later , not in the traditional sense ; they were infected by a virus , transmitted through the bite of an infected monkey . In " Dawn , " they were just straight up dead people , coming back from the grave , so to speak . So in a way , " Dawn " was the more true zombie flick . But you 're right , 28 Days did come out first ( 02 I think ? ) . And , in the grand scheme of things , I suppose this would fall into the Zombie sub-genre.

@@4241238 <p> rabble blogs are the personal pages of some of Canada 's most insightful progressive activists and commentators . All opinions belong to the writer ; however , writers are expected to adhere to our guidelines . We welcome new bloggers -- contact us for details . <h> Myths and facts about the Muslim prayer space <p> There 's growing hysteria against the prayer space for Muslim students at the Valley Park Middle School in Toronto . It 's claimed that it gives special treatment to Muslims , undermines public education and imposes sexism on society , and that we should support a supposedly broad-based multifaith coalition that opposes it . But this is based on a series of myths . <p> MYTH : The prayer space gives special treatment to Muslims and undermines secularism . <p> FACT : The prayer spaces promotes secularism by providing equal access to public education . <p> According to Toronto District School Board Education ( TDSB ) Director Chris Spence : " As a public school board , we have a responsibility and an obligation to accommodate faith needs . " With its weekends and vacations , the school calendar already accommodates students who pray on Saturday or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Furthermore , as Omar Qayum , a TDSB teacher pointed out , <p> " At my school we have Christian invocations every year during our Remembrance Day assemblies and during the Christmas holidays through carols -- nobody complains ! Furthermore , some schools partake in Hanukah , Diwali and Kwanza to honour their Jewish , Hindu and African-American students . " <p> The prayer space for Muslim students ensures that they are not excluded and forced to choose between their education and their faith . Rather than demanding the cancelling of Friday classes or having Muslim students miss class , the Friday prayer space ensures no disruption to non-Muslim students while promoting access to education for Muslim students . This is the essence of secularism : equal access to public services irrespective of religion . <p> Banning prayer spaces undermines this principle , and there 's a history of such discrimination towards Muslims . As an article in the Ottawa Citizen reminds us : <p> " It 's the same as the flap about civil arbitration back in 2005 . For more than a decade , the government of Ontario @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settle family disputes according to their faith 's rules provided the outcome did not violate generally applicable laws and principles . Not controversial in the least . Then a handful of Muslims asked to do the same , there was a mighty backlash , and the government scrapped the whole system . " <p> MYTH : The prayer space undermines public education . <p> FACT : Opposition to the prayer space is scapegoating Muslims for government cuts . <p> The Toronto Sun claimed that " the taxpayers are funding religious schools after all . Or at least one that we know of . If it 's not stopped now who knows where this will end up or how much it will cost . " <p> Firstly , taxpayers are not funding a separate Muslim prayer space , it is happening in the existing school cafeteria , organized and paid for by the local Muslim community . Secondly , we know of many religious schools that receive public funding : Catholic schools , which segregate boys and girls not only in separate prayer spaces but in separate schools . <p> Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of accommodation to religious minorities . Prayer spaces have not reduced education budgets and extra-curricular activities , or increased class sizes , budget cuts have . It 's no coincidence that minorities are being scapegoated in times of economic crisis and austerity measures . Britain 's conservative government is imposing massive cuts to jobs and services , including the tripling of university tuition . At the same time it 's blaming " multiculturalism " and giving confidence to extremist groups like the English Defense League who target Muslims . <p> MYTH : The prayer space is imposing segregation on education and society . <p> FACT : Muslims are being scapegoated for segregation that pervades society and all its institutions . <p> The hysteria against the prayer space gives the impression that girls and women would be liberated were it not for an optional weekly half hour Muslim prayer at one school . But segregation of the sexes exists in all religions -- including the segregation of menstruating women in some orthodox Jewish communities . As Aisha Sherazi , a formal principal wrote recently , " Growing up in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is up to the Muslim community to have a debate about whether they want to have mixed prayer or not . " But the Islamophobic campaign against the prayer space does not open up space for this debate , it closes it . <p> Furthermore the campaign suggests segregation is isolated to Muslim prayer space . But throughout society women face segregation -- in pay , reproductive choice , media images that shame their bodies , and levels of violence . Campaigns in Western countries against Muslims are scapegoating them for these far broader forms of segregation , while denying that Muslim women have any agency in their own lives . In France where less than 25 per cent of MPs are women , the government has claimed to liberate women by banning those who wear niqab from public space . <p> In Canada the federal Harper government refuses to investigate missing and murdered Aboriginal women , purged funding from women 's groups , imposed a maternal health plan that denies reproductive choice , and told women 's groups to " shut the fuck up . " As women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ford 's massive proposal of cuts will disproportionately hurt those who rely on city services -- from bus routes to dental care . Why are n't the groups up in arms over prayer space organizing protests against these policies of segregation affecting far broader population ? <p> MYTH : A broad multi-faith coalition opposes the prayer space . <p> FACT : A small number of fringe groups with a history of Islamophobia oppose the prayer space . <p> Far from being a large multi-faith opposition , the main organized opposition to the prayer space are fringe political groups with a history of Islamophobia : the Jewish Defense League ( an extremist Zionist group ) , the Christian Heritage Party ( a fringe right-wing party that calls for a moratorium on immigration from Muslim countries , and that opposes women 's choice ) , the Canadian Hindu Advocacy ( a Hindu nationalist group whose spokesperson claimed that Islamic civilization had contributed " less to human advancement than a pack of donkeys " ) and the Muslim Canadian Congress ( a small group whose spokeperson Tarek Fatah has become a media darling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It 's obvious that what unites these groups is not their love of public education or their commitment to women 's rights , but their Islamophobia . Despite their fringe numbers and beliefs , the media has helped them spark a hysterical reaction against an optional weekly half hour of prayer that does n't interfere with non-Muslims and which allow Muslim students to better integrate into public school -- but which like all religions and most of society has some form of segregation . These groups are trying to import the politics of David Cameron and the English Defense League , paying lip service to women 's rights and public education as an excuse to whip up Islamophobia , providing a scapegoat to economic crisis and austerity .

@@4243235 <h> Peter F. Hamilton 's The Evolutionary Void concludes The Void book series <h> Culture / July 25 , 2011 <p> What do you get when you mix fringe science , British humour , several fantastical characters and an immense plot of galactic reconciliation ? Easily , enough , you get The Void series , by Peter F. Hamilton . The five book in this series -- which goes from Pandora 's Star and Judas Unchained , two books that actually occur a thousand years before The Dreaming Void , The Temporal Void and finally The Evolutionary Void , which execute events of potentially galactic Armageddon -- chronicle the life stories of several characters across a massive empire known simply as the Commonwealth . <p> While transient players are different to each of the series ' eras , the main technologically immortal characters include Paula Myo , a genetically engineered super-cop whose determination and attention to detail has established her as the most efficient , ruthless and utterly effective justice junkie -- ahem , Investigator -- in the entire galaxy ; Oscar Monroe , a freedom fighter turned special operative whose out-of-the-box thinking and devotion to the goodwill of humanity on both the macro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) from annihilation at least twice ; Gore Bernoulli , an old aristocrat whose political clout and never-say-die demeanour has pulled plans and tactics for the good guys practically out of the ether ; and The Cat , a deranged psychopath whose only qualifications include practically genocidal killing sprees and overtly torturous murders motivated by little more than the desire to alleviate her boredom . And these are just the human players that help shape events . <p> The ( unofficially named ) Void series of course centres around what was once thought to be a black hole at the centre of the galaxy and what turns out to be an immense micro-universe known as -- ready ? Hang on tight -- the Void . While the events of the first two books occur before humans have the knowledge of the Void 's existence , they set up the personalities and characterizations of the major players who will confront it . For inside the Void , a telepathic human allows those outside to witness a paradise unachievable in the galaxy and universe beyond the Void 's devilishly black boundary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperate hell for those outside -- in order to power the heaven within , the boundary must expand and consume everything in its wake -- stars , planets , civilizations , all those sorts of things . Of course , any rational species with organs even closely resembling a brain would want such a beat to be destroyed ... but within the human Commonwealth , a religion has developed that grows eager to enter the Void ... <p> Exciting summary aside , the books read like cloak-and-dagger adventure novels , as factions war within ANA ( Advanced Neural Activities -- it 'd take too long to explain ) , agents attempt assassinations , and seemingly unimportant bystanders get caught up in the fray . Hamilton 's style is to soak the reader in action first and then provide some detail to give the white-knuckled masses a breather ( as well as a look into the wonderfully alien and fantastic universe he 's imagined for our species ' future ) . The storytelling is gripping , with more twists and surprises than a polyester rope and when the different perspectives finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either cliffhanging beauty or divine resolution that leaves the reader eager for more . Of course , each book is a bit long , each over a thousand pages and some even broken up into smaller acts to help the reader catch up on all the events , specialized jargon Hamilton has conjured out of pure necessity and the fantastical worlds that even now my imagination is struggling to conceive . <p> Cliches appear , unfortunately , but they turn out to be unique to the story of The Void series . People in the Commonwealth are smart , much smarter than the idiots making the same boring mistakes and humorous errors that befall modern entertainment and writing like obligatory check-marks on some invisible list . Subtle patterns emerge for those who read through the whole series that only the most engaged reader could decipher , so literally anyone reading through the entirety of The Void will pick up on them and almost squeal with delight when they come about full circle . The humour is witty and sublime , which is to be expected from a British author -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the tears welling up in my laughter-squinted eyes prevented me from seeing the words clearly . <p> All in all , Peter F. Hamilton 's work is an under-appreciated gem that should be explored and marvelled by all those brave enough to taste real , honest science fiction . But be warned -- he 's written many books , and after just one you 'll want them all .

" She came from a tight-knit Catholic family and was raised with Catholic religious values , " Rod Personius , her Buffalo-based lawyer , said in an interview Monday . " Her actions were just contrary to all she has been taught by her family .

@@4261230 <h> City councillors rarely see the larger , qualitative role that libraries play when they 're looking to save money . <p> It 's appropriate that Margaret Atwood has joined the fight against the proposed cuts to Toronto 's library system . En route to becoming one of Canada 's most important and best-known writers ( known , it would seem , to everyone but the mayor 's brother ) , Atwood imagined in more than one of her novels the kind of dystopian city Toronto would become should its libraries be cut , shuttered or privatized . <p> For centuries cities have been conceived of as utopian projects built upon ideals of reason , equality , social harmony , prosperity and happiness . Today city planners , councillors and critics are still working toward the same elusive goals . Those who live and work in cities hedge their bets , as did postwar planners in the previous century , on schools , libraries , clinics , and leisure and consumer spaces as the guardians and guarantors of freedom , regeneration , safety and a better , cleaner , smarter life . <p> But of course social and economic ills persist . They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rise of hyper-consumerism , and the politics and culture of exclusion , separation and inequality . Fiction writers were among the first to see limitations in the utopianism of modern urban planning . Early on it was H.G. Wells , Aldous Huxley and George Orwell . Later it was Ray Bradbury , Anthony Burgess , William Golding , Arthur Koestler , John Wyndham and , yes , Margaret Atwood . <p> These writers described totalitarian , over-masculine futures , where female sexuality was oppressed , where the sick and the poor were punished , where the environment was depleted , where technology was abusive , where industry and consumerism exploited , enslaved and conditioned society through propaganda . Dystopian novelists were n't the first to critique failed attempts at perfect societies . But by imagining large-scale human and natural disasters or by examining human dysfunction , bad people , bad ideas and wrong-headed impulses , dystopian fiction provided important cautionary messages . <p> Societies that willed themselves to ignorance at the hands of shortsighted political regimes could look forward to unsafe cities , where women did n't go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to school alone , where everyone was a stranger yet lived under constant surveillance .

Sadly , though , city councillors rarely see the larger , qualitative role that libraries play when they 're looking to save money . Nor do they realize the long-term costliness of targeting books . <p> The situation in Toronto is eerily similar to the U.K. 's now year-round debate about library closures , replete with literary luminaries rallying to the cause .

Meanwhile , reports confirm that cutting libraries will result in a less literate population . Reports also show that a less literate population commits more crime and is saddled with social problems that cost municipalities in countless other ways . A literate population , in other words , is decidedly healthier , more community-minded , informed , engaged and employable . <p> Here , too , is where the larger , philosophical arguments come into play about the role of common use spaces , like libraries , in nurturing individuality , inclusion and social cohesion , civic identity and pride , democracy and citizenship .

It 's counter-productive in every way and will almost certainly have the cumulative effect of reversing fiction and reality . Dystopian fiction will no longer be a cautionary tale of the writer 's imagination . It will no longer be the foreshadowing or imagined end of a society , but the permanent state of things .

But the deadly listeriosis outbreak in the summer of 2008 derailed the plan and the government 's initial timeline . <p> Ms. Airth now estimates CFIA will save about $4-million annually , because the agency spends about $6-million on the inspection program but only recovers about $2-million from the provinces . <p> Provincially registered meat plants are eligible to sell their products in the province in which they operate , but are barred from inter-provincial trade .

@@4268235 <h> The Ice Cream Truck Chronicles : Part Two <p> In June 2009 , the Toronto Star performed an investigation of sanitary conditions at some of Toronto 's soft-serve vendors and found that seasonal sellers ( i.e. ice cream truck vendors ) were among those with the highest concentrations of coliform bacteria in their product . Coliform is considered an index of overall cleanliness ; high concentrations are bad . The Star 's expos ? was arguably in the public interest , but it seems to have given reporters a bad name among soft-serve professionals .

The lighting/video rig above the stage is massive ; the catwalk in the middle of the floor led to a second , back-of-audience platform that gave Grohl control of the room when he wanted it ; and Grohl himself is larger than life -- a superstar of his industry for 20 years . <p> He 's a magnetic figure , one who can elevate the middling quality of the music simply by sweating a bit .

@@4270233 <p> As one of the most active road bike racers on the Team Whistler roster , Trevor Hopkins has often showed up to races on pavement with few teammates accompanying him . Not that it 's bothered him in the past . <p> " I 'm always motivated to race , " said Hopkins . <p> But it will be a different story during the GranFondo Whistler on Sept. 10 as Team Whistler has assembled a great squad of nine riders looking for a high-level result . <p> " We 've built a team to try and win the team event , " he said . " We 've put our fastest road racers , male and female , on the team . Everyone is very highly skilled and has a big background in racing . " <p> If history is any indication , Hopkins will be key to the team 's success in the ride up the Sea to Sky Highway from Vancouver to Whistler , as he had the best finish of any local resident last year by racing in the Giro division and finishing with a time of three hours , 30 minutes and 38 seconds . <p> " It went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vancouver to Whistler , " he said .

He posted two top-five category finishes , two more in the top seven and was never outside the top 20 in any event , be it road race , criterium or time trial . <p> Since then , Hopkins has come through with some other notable results on the road , including a decent overall placing in the Axel Merckx GranFondo in Penticton last month despite flat-tire issues . <p> " It was going really well for me .

@@4277231 <h> Top 10 Tuesday - NHL Goaltending Tandems <p> Having one star goalie is a tough task in today 's NHL . There are only a handful of " go to " guys that can carry a load of 65-70 games . The most successful teams are the ones that have a good starter who is backed up by a netminder of competence who can step in when injury or struggles occur . Here are my top 10 tandems heading into the 2011-12 season : <p> 10 . Martin Brodeur &amp; Johan Hedberg -- Marty is n't the same goalie he was 10 years ago , but he is still among the stars of the game . He might not win 40 games this year , but the man who turns 40 next May should still get over 30 with a resurgent New Jersey squad that ca n't be as bad as it started out last year . Hedberg is a capable veteran backup who can give the veteran a rest when needed . <p> 9 . Henrik Lundqvist &amp; Martin Biron -- Lundqvist is a top 5 goaltender in the league , and he is backed up by a veteran former #1 goalie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not complain if Lundqvist gets a vast majority of the starts . He will bide his time and fill in when called upon . <p> 8 . Antii Niemi &amp; Antero Niittymaki -- The Finnish duo were in an internal battle for the starting position , with Niemi having the upper hand at the end of the season . Niemi will be the clear #1 heading into the 2011-12 season , but he will be pushed by Niittymaki with whom the Sharks do not lose much in the net . <p> 7 . Pekka Rinne &amp; Anders Lindback -- Rinne emerged as a top flight goalie last season , and at 28 is entering his prime . Lindback is a huge 23 year old up and comer from the goaltending factory that is the Nashville Predators . With Rinne entrenched as the number one , it is only a matter of time before Lindback 's eyes wander to a team that needs help in net , but for now they are an elite combination . <p> 6 . Ilya Bryzgalov &amp; Sergei Bobrovsky -- Giving Bryzgalov the benefit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a top level team that he did with a lower tier team -- make a difference . The Flyers are betting on it , and having Bobrovsky as the backup will take some of the pressure off Ilya . Bobrovsky showed last season that he might not be #1 material yet , so having a fellow Russian to learn from will help his development . <p> 5 . Carey Price &amp; Peter Budaj -- Price is a top 5 goalie in the league , and will likely get 65 starts at least . Budaj struggled as the #1 in Colorado , but has a track record of being very good in a backup role . He will support Price as he continues his ascent into NHL stardom in one of the leagues toughest markets . <p> 4 . Ryan Miller &amp; Jhonas Enroth -- Miller is an elite goaltender , and Enroth is capable of being a starter in the NHL . Enroth almost balked at coming back to be the understudy , but eventually re-signed to give the Sabres an excellent tandem . With his slight body type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be fresher for the playoffs . This would help Buffalo go deeper in the post-season and Enroth would be a key to helping them get there . <p> Miller &amp; Enroth - Both capable starters <p> 3 . Jonathan Quick &amp; Jonathan Bernier -- The two Johns will be in a battle for the starting spot in LA , which can only push both to greater heights . Quick has been among the league leaders in wins over the past couple of seasons , but Bernier has served notice that he has paid his dues and wants his shot at #1 . Quick 's lack of playoff consistency might give reason for to Kings management to look to the younger Bernier when the chips are down . <p> 2 .

@@4287231 <p> Last week , at a youth centre in the village of Witney , Oxfordshire , British Prime Minister David Cameron stood in front of a wall of messy graffiti and pledged to put his country 's " broken society " back to the top of his political agenda . It must have been a vindicating moment for a leader who has been roundly mocked , at times excoriated , for his long-held insistence that British youth are suffering from a moral malaise that would best be cured , not by increased social spending , but a bracing dose of good old-fashioned community involvement . Picking up litter in a local park , perhaps , followed by a vigorous round of neighbourhood pickup soccer . <p> In fact , in the wake of the recent riots that have shocked Britain , these were just some of the solutions Cameron was laying out in Oxfordshire that Monday , to an anxiously receptive public . It is all part of his planned " national citizen service , " a kind of voluntary-sector answer to Britain 's formerly mandatory military service -- which , in the aftermath of the violence , there was some outlandish talk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social and security " fight-back " and a major crackdown on gang crime , Cameron 's obsession with civic engagement , which seemed hopelessly quaint just weeks ago , is starting to look altogether more prescient . Indeed , his much-scoffed-at idea of a Big Society -- the Tories ' flagship platform that , among other things , emphasizes smaller government , a bigger voluntary sector and devolution of power from Whitehall to councils -- has never seemed more relevant . <p> After several days of making conciliatory noises , opposition Labour Leader Ed Miliband was back on the attack last week , trying to take hold of the crisis for himself . He mocked the Prime Minister in front of an audience at his alma mater , a public high school in north London , not far from where the riots began . Dismissing as " gimmicks " Cameron 's threats to harass gang leaders in their homes and adopt an American-style " zero tolerance " approach to policing , Miliband tried to paint the new " tough on crime " Cameron as a hypocrite . " A Prime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hoodie ' now says we ought to reform health and safety laws ! " Miliband groused , referring to Cameron 's famous 2006 speech in which he urged an audience , " when you see a child walking down the road , hoodie up , head down , moody , swaggering , dominating the pavement -- think what has brought that child to that moment . " <p> But in fact , judging by the public mood , Cameron 's past support of compassionate conservatism combined with his new cries of a need for tougher policing are helping him to gain and secure the coveted middle ground . As Times columnist Matthew Parris put it , " few of us can have felt like hugging the hooded morons we 've been watching on television ( there were moments many of us felt like shooting them ) , but do n't we also sense something pathetic and bleak in the condition of kids and youths for whom this looting counts as sport ? These really are broken communities , broken families , broken people . " <p> The political road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worrisome is the growing divide within the Tory-led coalition over the issue of appropriate punishment for convicted looters .

Lib Dem deputy leader Simon Hughes characterized the measures as " knee-jerk , " and others warned of increased crime as a result . <p> But it appears the evictions will go ahead . The first notice was served in the London district of Wandsworth two weeks ago , to the single mother of an 18-year-old boy accused of violent disorder and burglary . And Cameron appears to be sticking to a hard line -- not surprising , as it 's one that dovetails nicely with his mission to drastically cut public spending . Of the evicted families , he told the BBC , " Obviously they 've got to be housed somewhere else -- they 'll have to find housing in the private sector -- and that will be tougher for them , but they should have thought of that before they started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cuts to police services , which he has not backed down from despite the need for a surge during the riots , which saw 16,000 police , instead of the normal 6,000 , flood onto London 's streets .

Still , the rift prompted Sir Hugh Orde , president of the Association of Chief Police Officers , to angrily dismiss the role of politicians in the riots as an " an irrelevance . " Cameron is also facing opposition to his decision to hire former New York and L.A. police chief Bill Bratton to consult on how to deal with gangs . " I am not sure I want to learn about gangs from an area of America that has 400 of them , " Orde told the press . " It seems to me , if you 've got 400 gangs , then you 're not being very effective .

While the Tory far right is keen to characterize the disturbances purely as an isolated outburst of criminality and blame parents , the opposition would like to see more support for the underclass of disaffected youth who are , in large part , responsible for the violence . Cameron has pledged to " turn around the lives of 120,000 of the most troubled families " by the next election in 2015 . That 's a whole lot of fixing of broken things . Let 's hope he 's feeling handy . <h> David Cameron rides the riots <p> Oh , my , Mr. Parris ! ! How very naughty of you , wanting to shoot those not playing the part ! Tsk , tsk .

It 's just terrible news for the Strait region and terrible news for Nova Scotia . " <p> MacLean was reacting to the announcement Monday by Ohio-based NewPage Corp . that it will indefinitely shut down its newsprint line at its Point Tupper mill Sept. 10 , to be followed by the shutdown of the supercalendered paper machine Sept. 16 , citing poor market conditions . The company has only said that it will provide future updates on the mill based on an ongoing review of the situation and economic conditions . <p> The mill directly employs 600 , supports 400 jobs in the harvesting and trucking of wood , and supports hundreds of other spinoff jobs in the region . <p> The economic impact of the closure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MacLean said , predicting the effects will be felt throughout the province . <p> News of the shutdown left the Town of Port Hawkesbury scrambling to schedule an emergency council meeting , which will take place tonight , and the executive of the Strait Area Chamber of Commerce also met Monday to discuss the developments . The executive of the Communications Energy and Paperworkers Local 972 , which represents unionized mill workers , also planned to meet , although details were n't immediately available because some members were on holidays . <p> " We 've been taking very little downtime on both paper machines the last two to three years , " CEP Local 972 first vice-president Archie MacLachlan said . " This is the first real downtime and we do n't know how long it 's going to be .

@@4287237 <p> Gone , for Anonymous , are the days of aimless Internet hijinks . The hacker group , once a loosely knit group of cyber-pranksters that formed in 2003 , has traded prank pizza deliveries and shock humour for high-profile attacks on authoritarian regimes . The community now attracts both political activists and hackers alike to campaigns targeting everyone from Arab dictatorships to opponents of WikiLeaks . <p> Last week , Anonymous carried out its latest offensive on an Arab government , when hackers swapped content on the Syrian Ministry of Defence website with a message calling on protesters to take down President Bashar al-Assad 's regime , which has killed an estimated 1,700 citizens since uprisings began five months ago . In June , the group claimed responsibility for revealing the passwords of hundreds of Bahraini , Egyptian , Moroccan and Jordanian government officials ' email accounts . And during the early stirrings of the Tunisian revolution in January , Anons ( as the group 's adherents are known ) created care packages that included instructions on how to conceal identities online and developed a script to help bloggers and news sources dodge a government-led phishing campaign . " It is simply impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maturing collective proclaimed on the @AnonymousIRC Twitter account on Aug. 9 . " We try our best . " <p> Other recent targets include businesses that withdrew their services from WikiLeaks when , in December , the organization released secret diplomatic cables , and the Orlando , Fla. , Chamber of Commerce , after members of the group Food Not Bombs were arrested for feeding the city 's homeless , against local laws . But the clandestine computer hacking group was n't always so interested in altruism . While Anons have maintained that their work is ultimately motivated by freedom of speech and anti-censorship ideals , it grew out of the notorious 4Chan message boards : an Internet repository for lolcats , anime and multiple genres of porn . <p> " It is a fascinating evolution , " New York-based application security expert Hugh Thompson told Maclean 's . " It 's becoming less annoying and more focused on tactical issues , " adds computer security expert David Skillicorn of Queen 's University . While Anonymous 's decentralized structure makes it difficult to attribute a change in direction to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a clear change in tone . <p> The community 's structure , however , makes it difficult to define its political values or to get hackers to support a singular goal or cause , says Thompson . If there 's no leadership , he adds , it 's very difficult to maintain a vision . " It 's about agreeing with a particular direction or style , " says Skillicorn , rather than " having a vote and approving various kinds of activities . " <p> Indeed , the group has no formal membership or constitution , and analysts often compare its decision-making process to a hive , where a majority -- not a hierarchy -- determines which campaigns they undertake . For this reason , Skillicorn says Anonymous should be understood as a brand rather than an organization : " People are coming in and out of the group and in and out of campaigns . Anyone can claim to be Anonymous and there 's really no way to disprove it , " he says . <p> The future for Anonymous , it seems , is not just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's website and its executives after the electronics giant launched a lawsuit against a man who hacked the company 's PlayStation 3 console ; in June , Spanish police arrested three hackers allegedly operating under the Anonymous umbrella in connection to the Sony hacks .

One member explained the operation had been planned , but abandoned , until other Anons stumbled upon the remnants of the blueprint in a chat room and rebooted the operation . Another high-profile Anon took to Twitter , calling into question the feasibility of the operation . <p> Even if Anonymous morphs into a mature political movement , however , the relative anonymity of the online world will ensure that the other activities the group carries out wo n't disappear , says Thompson .

In May 1964 , they were convicted at Chester Assizes : Brady of three murders ; his more than willing accomplice of two .

Most people find that easier to live with . <p> In 1985 , he was declared criminally insane and transferred from a high security prison to one of the so-called special hospitals . In 2001 , he published a book The Gates Of Janus , about the psychology of serial killers . Although this met with predictable outrage , it has been suggested that it was the nearest Brady has or could come to showing remorse for and to repay society for his crimes . <p> Being a convicted serial killer , Brady is fair game for any hack , crank or half-wit to take pot shots at .

A woman who had once believed him to be her father visited him and afterwards claimed falsely that he had assaulted her . Brady was allowed to pursue this claim all the way up to the European Court of Human Rights . <p> Although proponents of the death penalty sometimes give the impression that a life sentence is a soft alternative , not every life sentence prisoner sees it that way . Brady decided many years ago that he wants out , but the legal authorities have decided otherwise , and after he went on hunger strike , he was force fed by order of the court ; a judge actually accused him of " playing the system " and of being manipulative as well as mad . <p> The latest development in the saga of the world 's last surviving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common assault .

Although Brady is now 73 years old , he will surely never be left unsupervised with a vulnerable female or vulnerable anyone . If he is to be subjected to any sort of investigation or disciplinary inquiry , then this should just as surely be dealt with internally . An inmate who is accused of a serious offence can and should be taken to an outside court as was convicted murderer Rickie Tregaskis who slashed the face of paedophile and child killer Roy Whiting in Wakefield Prison .

A new arena or stadium may benefit the city as a whole by improving the quality of life of the community , " Hodgson said . <p> Those factors can include the chance of boosting a city 's profile as a place to invest , visit as a tourist or live . There 's also the temporary boost from construction jobs and the possibility of spinoff jobs and other local investment .

With other facilities , it 's worth asking if they have a future recreational uses , such as training facilities for future generations of athletes , before opening the public treasury . <p> The success stories for private financing of sports facilities in Canada are the Air Canada Centre in Toronto , Montreal 's Bell Centre and Rogers Arena in Vancouver .

And it 's modernizing fast too . For a recent vacation , I hit the road in Turkey , with romantic memories ( a few years old ) of horse-drawn carriages and villages with economies powered by hay , dung and ducks . While that rustic old world is tougher to find , the deep traditions and warm hospitality of the region are as endearing as ever , especially if you venture past the predictable sights and tourist zones .

It 's famous for its once-spectacular , now-ruined Temple of Artemis -- one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World -- and the dramatic , partially restored Library of Celsus , one of the largest libraries of its time .

Simmons says the timing is right to discuss banning fisticuffs in the NHL and those involved in the game at all levels , should have a say . ( Alex Urosevic/QMI AGENCY ) <h> Related Stories <h> Topics <p> The time has come for the National Hockey League Players ' Association to poll its membership to determine whether players want fighting to continue in hockey . <p> And those doing the job , and those most affected by it , deserve a voice in the future of their game . <p> Where once there would be no need for such a vote because the result would have been obvious and overwhelmingly one-sided , there is a need now . There may even be an appetite for it among the players , especially if it 's done by secret ballot . <p> The majority of those who play the game professionally have grown up in a culture of hockey that does n't just enable fighting , but encourages it . But long before the tragedies of this hockey summer -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belak -- there seemed to be a shift emerging with both players and hockey fans . <p> It is n't just about correlating these terrible circumstances . The NHL and the NHLPA plan on investigating that . It 's about removing a danger from the sport . Fighting had become dangerous before anyone died this summer and there is still no tangible evidence that fighting played a part in the deaths of the three NHL enforcers . But the time is right to examine its place in the game . And that examination should begin with the players themselves , who need to have a say in their own futures . <p> THIS AND THAT <p> The joint NHL and NHLPA investigation into the three deaths of this hockey summer needs to conducted independently and by those with no affiliation or connection to either the league or the players ' union . Otherwise , it will have little meaning ... The Players ' Association would also be wise to take a long and hard look at the culture of mixing alcohol with prescription medication that is evident within the sport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What we may never know , and may not be entitled to know , is what prompted the leap from depression to suicide ... No one has been harder on the PA over the years than me , but blaming them for the recent deaths is way out of bounds ... Belak was originally drafted by Quebec in 1994 , 12th overall , the first pick in a Nordiques draft that included Chris Drury , Milan Hejduk and the multi-award winning goaltender , Tim Thomas . Only two of the players drafted ahead of Belak remain active in the NHL : Ed Jovanovski in Florida and Ryan Smyth in Edmonton ... The six highest-paid Maple Leafs , based on salary cap hit are 1 . Dion Phaneuf ; 2 . Phil Kessel ; 3 . Tim Connolly ; 4 . Mike Komisarek ; 5 . Joffrey Lupul ; 6 . John-Michael Liles . And by most hockey standards , at least four of them , possibly five , are considered bad contracts . The Kessel contract is fair value for what he does . <p> HEAR AND THERE <p> Alex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is little chance the Blue Jays ' slugging outfielder will finish ahead of Curtis Granderson , Jacoby Ellsbury or pitcher Justin Verlander in the American League voting ...

Sometimes , a change of scenery is necessary : Kelly Johnson is hitting .367 with a .472 on base percentage with the Jays since being swapped for Aaron Hill , who has a .355 batting average and .412 on base percentage in Arizona ... Ca n't remember a September like this without a real pennant race of any kind , in either league . The only real race , between the Yankees and Red Sox , does n't matter .

And it seems particularly relevant considering Dylan Armstrong of Kamloops has won Canada 's first-ever medal in field at the world track and field championships ... If the Saskatchewan Roughriders miss the playoffs by a game or two , they can blame the Chicago Bears . Why the Bears held on to receiver Andy Fantuz until Friday , without giving him any meaningful playing time , is a mystery ...

And hey , whatever became of Eric Fichaud ? <p> Jim Barker <p> When coach Jim Barker removed Cleo Lemon at halftime Friday night , it seemed like the right thing to do . Which is strange , considering Lemon had completed 11 of 15 first-half passes for the Argos and had three passes dropped . In other words , he had successfully thrown 14 of 15 balls in the half and got pulled for not having enough yards . Fair enough . But the score was only 13-6 at the half . The game was still in play . After putting backup Dalton Bell in , Barker watched as he threw two terrible interceptions on his first two passes , leading to 10 B.C. points and a 23-6 lead . Why he did n't pull Bell at that point only he can explain . He left him in for the entire half , for his four interceptions , basically giving his backup quarterback one more chance at the expense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid to win games .

The track and field world can not undo the false start disqualification of Usain Bolt in the 100-metres final of the world championships . What it can do is try and make certain this never happens again . Bolt , who bounced back to win the 200 metres on Saturday and should also win gold in the 4X100 relay , is the sport 's calling card . However the rules are made , track has to find a way to not lose its signature performers on the biggest of occasions .

Apparently , I am a singular voice on this , but it bothers me nonetheless . I actually like the reason for the rule and the protection of the punt returner . But here 's how I would re-work the rule . If a punt is in the air , the kicking team must give five yards clearance to the return man upon catching the ball . But , if the punt hits the ground or is squibbed , the five yard clearance should be waived . The reason for this : When the ball is the air , the football player is n't backing away from the play .

@@4328230 <p> In the Danish city of Aarhus , a big university town by the sea , young men stream into the offices of Cryos International each day to fill a cup with their semen -- so many that there 's a 600-person waiting list . Guinness World Records lists it as the planet 's largest sperm bank : It has 140,000 samples available , ships to more than 65 countries and helps to impregnate close to 2,000 women a year . <p> International headlines have compared it to the new Viking invasion : " How Danish Sperm is Conquering the World , " said one ; another , " the Viking Baby Boom . " Yet beneath the big horns and bravado , there has been more fretting in Denmark over the future of manhood than in most places on Earth . <p> One reason they are such avid sperm donors is that their own country is in need : Danes have among the world 's lower sperm counts . They also have one of the highest rates of assisted reproduction ( more than 8 per cent of births ) , testicular cancer and male genital abnormalities . <p> If the sperm story in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very different sides , it 's no wonder that it has become an epic saga of confusion and conflict in the rest of the world . <p> It was Danish scientists who first reported in 1991 that sperm counts were in free fall around the globe . They announced counts had dropped by an alarming 50 per cent worldwide between 1938 and 1990 and predicted the trend would continue , painting a picture so bleak it suggested all men were on the road to sterility . <p> Many scientists hammered the study as flawed , but the news went off like a bomb in the news media , igniting debates over a long , worrisome list of possible causes , from estrogen exposure to toxic chemicals to long car trips and tight pants . <p> Yet 20 years later , despite everything riding on it -- male sexual health and the very survival of the species -- researchers are split over whether it 's true . <p> " We do n't even have consensus about what determines quality sperm -- is it density , shape , total number ? ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? It 's like comparing apples and bananas , " says Ole Schou , founder of Cryos . " But everybody in the general population thinks there 's something wrong with sperm . " <p> " This area is a mess , " says Keith Jarvi , head of urology at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto . " The only consensus is we really do n't know . " <p> Some experts think things are looking up ; others still fear that society may face the kind of apocalyptic scenario depicted in Children of Men , the 1992 P.D . James novel and 2006 film about a chaotic , wartorn world of humans unable to procreate . ( The novel was in fact inspired by reports of falling sperm counts . ) <p> It 's a long route from the day that pure curiosity drove a 17th-century Dutch scientist to peer down his homemade microscope at the fluid he had captured from a conjugal romp . <p> Anton Van Leeuwenhoek worried that his descriptions of the wee creatures he saw swimming vigorously might " disgust or scandalize the learned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view and published his descriptions of spermatozoa , the " sperm animals " he saw , as well as his hunch that sperm had something to do with fertility -- even though many people for the next hundred years thought they were parasites . <p> Only in the 19th century were sperm recognized as the cellular seeds of male fertility . And soon after , people started counting them as a measure of such -- in frogs , roosters and , eventually , men . By the 1930s , studies had stacked up enough to define a normal range , which led to international comparisons . It was in October , 1991 , at a World Health Organization meeting on environment and reproductive health that researchers at the University of Copenhagen shocked the world with theirs . <p> Tracking sperm counts of nearly 15,000 fertile men published in 61 studies over 50 years , researchers led by Niels Skakkebaek found sperm concentration in human semen had fallen worldwide by nearly half -- a progression they depicted with a dark line sloping down through the decades . <p> " It looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine . " If you followed the linear , downward trajectory that the researchers had drawn through it -- it said all men would be infertile by around 2010 ... if the line continued . " <p> Along with a reduction in male fertility , they wrote that the falling counts coincided with a troubling rise in abnormalities of male genitalia -- testicular cancer , undescended testicles and misplaced urethras . Together , it looked to them like a collection of new disorders striking males , one they would later call " testicular dysgenesis syndrome . " And the speed of it suggested an environmental culprit . <p> Bottom of the animal kingdom <p> In the days before Viagra , when issues around male sexual health were still in the closet , these findings stoked anxieties : Man 's fertility had been measured , and he was falling short . <p> Yet , said Dr. Lamb , a fertility expert at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston , " people had a field day with this graph . Some researchers did their own analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a U-shape , that something catastrophic happened to sperm counts in the 1970s -- maybe something to do with Saturday Night Fever -- and that things were on the upswing . " <p> Bernard Robaire , a professor of pharmacology and expert in male reproduction at McGill University in Montreal , calls it " the worst statistically analyzed study that I 've seen . " <p> Yet even Dr. Robaire feels that " it was a good thing because it got people talking about men 's health . " <p> And so began a flurry of studies to investigate if human sperm was truly headed for extinction . <p> For Richard Sharpe , the world 's interest in testes could not have come sooner . An expert in male reproductive health at the University of Edinburgh , Dr. Sharpe is troubled by the health of human testes . For the size of them , he says , men do n't produce nearly enough sperm , and most of what they do make is useless -- only 5 to 15 per cent is viable . For other male animals -- " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cows , rabbits " -- the ratio is nine out of 10 : " We 're in League Division 7 , and every other animal is in League 1 . " <p> At the time of the Danish report , he and Dr. Skakkebaek were leading proponents of the idea that overexposure to the female hormone estrogen had put male reproductive health in peril . <p> The hypothesis suggests that estrogens found in everyday foods such as milk and soy , along with synthetic estrogens in pollutants , were wreaking havoc with male reproductive systems . It seemed to jibe with reports at the time of testicular cancer rising more than two-fold , news of fish ( and other wildlife ) becoming feminized and vexing reports , one of them from Canada , that the number of male children being born was lagging behind the number of females . <p> But studies since have not borne out the estrogen threat and most scientists have largely abandoned the idea , Dr. Sharpe included . Neither has research revealed any one environmental contaminant to explain lower sperm counts in the general population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a role , but studies have yet to identify them . <p> Instead , he says , he now feels that the best predictor of a man 's reproductive health is what happened with his mother while he was still in her womb . <p> Geography is destiny <p> Researchers trying to confirm the falling-sperm-count story were finding different answers all over the map . Numbers looked higher in Finland than Hong Kong , Scotland and parts of Africa . Recent Finnish numbers have fallen , while Sweden 's are stable . Counts look good in France , and bad in Thailand . The U.S. tally plots east over west , with sperm counts higher in New York and lower in California . <p> " There 's a difference between countries , there 's a difference between men living in different parts of countries . There is just so much variation , " Dr. Jarvi says . But he says no one can explain if it reflects differences in geography , temperatures , environment or genetics . <p> What 's more , with all the things that can foul up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unreliable , including the Danish report that raised the flag in the first place . <p> A healthy man makes about 80 million sperm a day , or 100 a second . But these numbers can change with age , and by season , and dwindle for any number of reasons -- if a man gets too hot or has too little sleep , has a car accident or , of course , has sex -- suddenly his count lands in the low range . <p> A good study should have men abstain from ejaculation for two to five days to collect an accurate sample -- but it 's difficult to know for sure . " The most striking thing missing from nearly half the papers in the Danish reportwas the duration of abstinence prior to the sample collected , " says Vancouver 's David Mortimer , past president of the Canadian Fertility and Andrology Society . <p> In his controversial book The Skeptical Environmentalist , Bjorn Lomborg , a former member of Greenpeace , argues that semen samples collected in the 1930s before the sexual revolution and the birth-control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Modern men are far more sexually active , which might also explain why sperm counts seem lower . <p> Besides , sperm counts are " one of the least useful measures of fertility , " compared with how well a sperm swims and its shape , Dr. Mortimer says . The trouble is that picking individual sperm out of the crowd under a microscope is tricky . <p> " It 's like looking down on a very busy street from the 11th floor on Bay Street -- you see cars ... but you do n't know anything about their engines , " says Sergey Moskovtsev of the Create Fertility Centre in Toronto . <p> Labs are also notorious for miscounting sperm . Four times a year , the American Association of Bioanalysis sends out batches of the same semen sample to 500 U.S. labs for proficiency testing , Dr. Lamb says . Most fail . <p> Dr. Mortimer cites a study in which two labs tested a sample from the same man and found that " at the one lab the fellow would be identified as infertile , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still , he adds , " I would say there probably is a decline in sperm counts worldwide -- but I would not stand up in a court of law and say so . " <p> Nor can anyone at the moment , says McGill 's Dr. Robaire , who also serves as editor-in-chief of the Biology of Reproduction Journal . " I 've seen too much garbage , too many bad studies . " <p> His own reading of the numbers is that counts clearly fell after the Second World War , stabilized and then picked up slightly . The big postwar dip coincides with women picking up smoking , he suspects , as animal studies show maternal smoking can reduce the number of stem cells in the developing male that make sperm . ( Danish women had the highest smoking prevalence in Northern Europe after the war , studies find , peaking at about 40 per cent in pregnant women in the 1980s . ) <p> In Canada , meanwhile there have been no national sperm-count studies at all . " No one 's bothered to put it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not been there . " <p> Yet , as the experts like to say , testes are like those old canaries in a coal mine -- they die first if there 's trouble . " Semen is a reflection of overall health and well-being , " Dr. Moskovtsev says . <p> Down for the count <p> Over time , the World Health Organization has dramatically lowered the bar for a normal sperm count , based on sperm concentrations among men who impregnated a woman in a one-year period of unprotected intercourse . The guidelines used to peg the low end of fertility at 60 million sperm per millilitre , Dr. Moskovtsev says . Then it fell to 40 , then 20 and in the most recent edition , published last year , it sits at 15 million . <p> Some researchers worry that this is a move in the wrong direction . In a letter published last week in the journal Science , Dr. Sharpe wrote : " It is time to stop accepting low sperm count as normal and confront the possibility that the fertility of present and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latest research shows that the proportion of men with high sperm counts is declining , while the number of men with low counts is rising . And it 's not just sperm counts , he says , but testosterone levels too -- that hallmark hormone of manhood . <p> " It 's declined , independent of age , on both sides of the Atlantic , " Dr. Sharpe says . This could be due to the increase in obesity , he says , since abdominal fat can lower testosterone levels , or to conditions when a male fetus develops in the womb -- one of the few areas of consensus in sperm studies today . <p> A woman 's diet , lifestyle and environmental exposures , particularly in the early months of her pregnancy as male sex organs are forming , can have a major impact on the man her baby boy will grow up to be . <p> This is good news , Dr. Sharpe says . " It suggests the low-sperm-count trend is preventable . " And in his opinion the need is urgent . " Men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abnormal sperm , " and if they make few sperm to begin with , and they delay having children and fertility declines with age , " there 's not a lot of room to manoeuvre , " he says . <p> But Dr. Lamb does n't see the urgency . " If it was something terribly dramatic already , you should see evidence of it in infertility rates -- and the incidence of that has not increased , " she says . " In most Western countries , it hovers around 15 to 17 per cent of couples of reproductive age . " <p> The number of people seeking infertility treatments has risen , she adds , but that 's a reflection of the fact that it has become more socially acceptable to do so , and that more treatments are available . <p> " It 's still an important hypothesis that sperm counts are falling , " she says . " But there 's no strong data , rigorously controlled , to suggest that men are at huge risk right now of becoming sterile . " <p> Meanwhile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into controversy . A few years after the Danish study appeared , Dr. Skakkebaek and his team began an ambitious project to track sperm counts not by looking back at dubious data , but by looking forward . They began following 5,000 18-year-olds bound for the military , taking detailed histories and sperm samples year after year . <p> This spring , they sent a confidential interim report to the National Board of Health , showing they had found no decline in sperm counts over the past 15 years . Without the researchers ' prior knowledge or permission , the board posted the report on its public website and refused to take it down . Another research team then analyzed the data in the journal Epidemiology . <p> It was billed as optimistic news , though it still carried a note of caution , warning that " it may be too early for society to dismiss the concerns " depicted in Children of Men . <p> Dr. Skakkebaek and his team faulted the other researchers for drawing misleading conclusions from the raw and incomplete data , which they said should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the older study 's 50-year range . <p> Yet Peter Saugmann-Jensen , an official with the Danish health board , said the agency felt compelled to publicize the interim finding , given the widespread anxiety , especially in Denmark , over sperm . <p> He told the journal Science in June that the board " had concerns about a negative stamp being put on a whole generation of men , " pointing out a Slate.com article that dubbed Danish men " Little Princes of Denmark . " <p> Before the board released the research , an official visited the sperm bank in Aarhus .

" One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single event out of its greater context and use Deline 's way of argumentation . " <p> When Franklin and the members of an overland expedition wintered at Fort Franklin in 1825 , the Royal Navy commander wrote in a letter to Britain that his men were playing games of " hockey on the ice " to keep their spirits up . And in a separate reference in his diaries , Franklin noted that " skating " was among the winter " amusements " enjoyed by his men . <p> Whether Franklin 's men were playing their rudimentary form of hockey at the same time that they wearing skates remains unknown .

@@4328234 though humble ( always humble ) opinion of this reader , the best all-round novelist at work in Canada today resides in humble ( always humble ) Saskatoon . And it 's not that city 's high-concept allegorist I speak of , but the more stylistically humble ( always humble ) Guy Vanderhaeghe . <p> His long-time-coming new novel , A Good Man , is the kind of impeccably crafted , Dickensian charmer we have come to expect from Vanderhaeghe 's now completed " literary western " trilogy , a collection of thematically if not narratively connected fictions about the death of the wild in the Wild West . This remarkable series ( no less important in defining its originating culture than Ford Madox Ford 's Parade 's End ) started with the knockout The Englishman 's Boy , raised the bar with the masterpiece The Last Crossing , and now comes to a close with the deeply satisfying A Good Man , a historical novel dealing with ethics , politics and nationhood that is more entertaining than political historical novels about nationhood have any business being . <p> If A Good Man is the most structurally complex of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about our present realities . It manages to track the ongoing itchiness that plagues our identity from its earliest days to our contemporary split personality , the anxious dance of diplomacy that results from trying to live peaceably to the north of a beast that , for better or worse , was born of ambition and blood . <p> Wesley Case starts his career as that textbook Canadian hero -- a Mountie -- but after leaving the police in a cloud of shame , he takes on a job even more essential to our nation 's survival : a diplomat . Case 's file is strictly unofficial , however , making him more spy than envoy . His job is to trade intelligence between Major Walsh and Major Ilges , the respective Canadian and American commanders of forts that straddle the border . Out on the plains , the " threat " of Sitting Bull and the Sioux waits . But for Case , native warriors are n't the real problem . Rather it 's the clash of personalities : Walsh , proud and stubborn , hates Ilges , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frontier fortresses , we meet a world of secondary characters , backstories and subplots . While the presumed antagonists are the Sioux and the rising Fenian revolutionaries , the real dynamics are far more nuanced than " bad guys " and " good guys . " As with Conrad 's The Secret Agent , A Good Man is a novel of early espionage and its engagement with what might be called proto-terrorism . Yet this makes the novel sound unfairly burdensome . For in fact it is , at heart , a novel of character . Three characters , to be precise : Case , Dunne , a gifted thug-for-hire , and the unhappily married , courageous Ada Tarr , for whom the two men , secret agents both , fall . <p> There are , characteristically , bountiful and varied pleasures to be had in A Good Man . There are the visceral skirmishes in and with the wilderness , Vanderhaeghe 's descriptions of the natural world often as striking as Cormac McCarthy 's ( " Then there is a slow flush of light ; a pile of cloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ) . There is the comic banter , the bawdy jokes . There 's also effortlessly vivid scene setting , as in a frontier ball where " expansive tracts of bosom are on display , and a constant , coquettish fluttering of painted fans agitates the air . " And , of course , the deft physical characterizations ( " a softhead , a simpleton who mooned about the hallways ... his mouth hanging open slackly as if he were inviting houseflies to lay eggs on his tongue " ) . <p> As with the preceding two novels , A Good Man does n't shy from romance , either . The doomed love triangle among Dunne , Case and Ada is believably fierce , organically integrated to the plot and ( if I may be forgiven the anachronism ) super-hot . Dunne is a dangerous man by training , a giant powered by a midget 's heart .

This is a trilogy of theme and character more than chronology or , in the end , even history . The main thing is that these are novels offering storytelling pleasures so robust that , after reading them , we are reminded how long we have gone without gravy and biscuits and whisky in our all-protein literary diets .

Those whose fervour for cuts forces the TTC to reduce service levels , abandon needed system expansion , and delay vehicle replacement may create a transit future that resembles the condition of the TRC by 1921 . <p> And its condition was not so good . By the second decade of the 20th century , the financial difficulties TRC owner Sir William Mackenzie experienced with his other railway interests reduced the amount of money poured into the streetcar system . Anxiety about the approaching end of the TRC franchise played a role in the TRC 's decision to avoid long-term investment in its network by maintaining it at a barely functioning service level . One method of saving a buck was to argue successfully in court that the franchise did n't require that new track be built outside the boundaries of the City of Toronto as they were delineated in the early 1890s .

As the end of the franchise approached , the TRC saw little need to undertake massive track repairs or upgrade repair shops that were built for horse-drawn vehicles . <p> The TRC 's actions resulted in the City forming its own transit company , Toronto Civic Railways ( TCR ) , in 1912 . Via unlinked routes , the TRC serviced annexed areas like Danforth Avenue , St. Clair Avenue , East Toronto and the Junction . To add to rider confusion , suburban networks like the Toronto &amp; York Radial Railway and the Toronto Suburban Railway also ran lines into the city through areas the TRC refused to extend . By the end of 1919 , it was theoretically possible for a rider to pay nine separate fares in the city , with no transfers between any of them . <p> The first batch of TTC fare tickets .

Single rides that had cost two cents on some TCR routes and five cents on TRC streetcars were now seven cents . The new fare rate was designed by TTC officials to make the service self-sufficient , to cover operating and maintenance costs without piling on debt .

They 're supposed to collect the water from your roof and direct it as far away from your home 's foundation as possible -- I suggest at least five feet , but it depends on how close your neighbour 's property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few things that can get in the way of gutters doing their job . Some examples : <p> Two sides to every gutter eavestroughs and downspouts Many of the newer homes being built have more than just a single roof . For example , there could be a roof over the garage , one over the second floor of the house , and smaller ones over rooms that extend from the house , such as a kitchen area or mud room . No matter what , there should be an eavestrough running along the bottom of every roofline on a house . Every eavestrough needs to have a downspout that drains the collected water away from its roof . You never want a downspout to drain water directly onto a lower-level roof ; this will cause water and ice damage to the shingles and roof deck underneath . It must always drain into a lower roof 's eavestrough . You also never want a downspout to drain directly into the weeping tiles below ground or near the foundation -- this causes water damage to the foundation . In either case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roof or foundation level . Not a good thing . <p> Let the pros do their job Some people think gutters can be a DIY project . Most DIY gutters are plastic and come in standard sections of about 10 to 12 feet . Plastic gets brittle , especially in the cold , and will need to be replaced . That 's why aluminum is the industry standard for gutters . It never rusts , unlike steel , and it 's weather resistant , unlike plastic . We also want to use a thick gauge for all metal gutters . The thicker the gauge , the longer they 'll last . When gutters are built in sections , there 's going to be seams , and seams can leak . And believe me , if it can leak , it will . That 's why I only recommend seamless eavestroughs . <p> Professionals use a forming machine to construct seamless eavestroughs -- custom-sized to fit the length of any roof . It 's the only way an eavestrough should be done and it 's the only way to prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitched correctly . Otherwise , water wo n't drain properly . You want something that 's going to last . You do n't want something you 'll have to replace after the first winter . Doing it right the first time means we do n't have to do it again . You always need to bring in the right people for the right job , so get a professional to install your gutters . <p> Maintenance Before the temperature drops below freezing , our gutters need to be clear of any debris . If eavestroughs and downspouts are clogged , two things will happen : First , any debris and water caught in the eavestrough will freeze into a channel of frozen muck . This will overload the eavestrough and eventually it will warp ( remember , water expands as it freezes ) . <p> Secondly , water can back up under the shingles and cause ice damming and water damage to the roof deck . I know it 's a pain to go up there and clean out the gutters , so some people put it off for as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to preserve the integrity of your roof . A good way to prevent clogging is by installing a screen guard that sits over the eavestrough . This prevents any leaves or debris from falling in . It also eliminates the chore of having to clean your gutters . There are a few screen guard products you can install yourself . Just remember to brush off any leaves that get stuck on the screen so they do n't block the screen 's holes and prevent proper draining . <p> I 've heard complaints about ice damming after installing a screen over eavestroughs . Let me be clear : The screen is n't causing ice damming , it 's heat loss from the home that 's causing it . You know those icicles that hang off the gutters in the winter ? Icicles are created when snow melts , and then the water refreezes before it drains through the eavestroughs . How can the snow on our roof be melting if the temperature outdoors is below freezing ? Because heat is escaping from the roof and melting the snow . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insulating your attic better and double-checking your roof for heat loss . <p> It 's important to protect our homes in winter weather . A big part of that protection comes from our gutters . If we do our job and maintain them , they 'll do their job and protect our homes from precipitation and water . <p> Catch Mike on Holmes Inspection , Thursdays at 10 p.m. on HGTV .

@@4342234 <p> Political parties know their promises are empty calories to many voters -- tasty at first , but ultimately unsatisfying .

They ascribe no additional costs to these promises , because they say it 's already built into their budget or infrastructure plan . <p> You may want to read the fine print on the Progressive Conservative label . The numbers add up , but their promise of significant tax cuts while matching Liberal spending in health and education creates a real strain that they have not fully explained . <p> The Liberals have helpfully made a video to unpack what they call a resulting $14-billion hole . They say that deep cuts are coming , especially in health care , because , they imply , it is in Tory Leader Tim Hudak 's nature -- he 's a Mike Harris clone .

" <p> Both predictions are problematic . Actual corporate tax revenues fluctuate by billions of dollars a year . They are more responsive to overall economic conditions than the actual tax rate . The savings , on the other hand , could well include cuts , especially to public sector wages , of a kind that the NDP actively oppose . <p> All parties neglect two looming challenges . <p> The first is the real prospect of another economic downturn .

The Liberals have succeeded with some reforms , specifically around drug costs , that helped keep growth in health care spending to only 3.2 per cent last year . But bigger cost increases are coming -- thanks to an aging society , more expensive treatment options , and public demands for better treatment . If governments were really intent on transforming the sector -- with a stronger push in electronic health care records , a harder move away from hospitalization , or a real investment in under-resourced areas , like mental health -- it 'll take some up front spending . <p> No party has proposed anything like that kind of spending .

He worked in logging camps to pay for his college education and medical training . He went overseas in World War I , where the British regarded Canadian soldiers as undisciplined wild men . <p> After the war Bethune stayed in Britain as a doctor , but felt very much an outsider , patronized by his colleagues .

He even invented a range of surgical tools to make the operation faster and easier . <p> His own reputation as a surgeon , however , was dubious . Colleagues admired his speed and his willingness to take on desperate cases . He clearly cared deeply for his patients ' well-being , especially children . For years he served as a surgeon in a Quebec Catholic hospital , where his efforts were very much appreciated .

With little to keep him in Canada , he persuaded the Canadian Communist Party to send him to Spain to help the Loyalist cause . <p> Once there , he hit on the idea of a mobile service that would provide battlefield blood transfusions .

Bethune seemed to have learned nothing from his Spanish experience . He could not or would not learn the local language , and he was oblivious to cultural differences . <p> Living like a soldier <p> Yet he made it to the Communists ' capital , Yanan , with a Canadian nurse from the team and some medical supplies .

Incompetence and unsanitary conditions triggered classic eruptions , and he could explode at his superiors as well . The Chinese were baffled and embarrassed by such tantrums . <p> Yet he carried on , though the Canadian Communists never answered his requests for more money and supplies . And he got results . Wounded soldiers were surviving in greater numbers . His Chinese students learned fast even across the language barrier .

It was as if he could not imagine himself in any medical role except as a direct , hands-on surgeon . <p> A Communist exemplar <p> His death on Nov. 12 , 1939 was a blow to the Eighth Route Army , but Mao took the opportunity to glorify him in an essay , " In Memory of Norman Bethune , " which portrayed him as a communist exemplar : " Comrade Bethune 's spirit , his utter devotion to others without any sense of self , was shown in his great sense of responsibility in his work and his great warm-heartedness towards all comrades and the people .

A National Film Board documentary about him provided an opportunity for the Trudeau government to resume relations with Beijing in the early 1970s . <p> Norman Bethune was in many ways a " horrible man , " as one of his acquaintances described him .

Wing 's produces a variety of foods , including traditional Chinese noodles , and much of its competition comes from Asia . <p> Competing on the basis of cost has been difficult for the company because its overseas competitors have cheaper labour and lower equipment costs at their disposal . <p> Wing 's has been leveraging research and development to close the cost gap . That 's where the new grant comes in -- part of it will help fund research work at the University of Guelph , where the company is developing its food products so they can be made with Ontario-grown wheat , which tends to be softer than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asian food products such as noodles . <p> Being able to incorporate the cheaper Ontario wheat into Wing 's products will give the company a cost advantage . " To do this , we had to advance our research and development , " Mr. Alexander said . <p> While government grants can help companies grow -- and in Wing 's case , help fund research and development -- grants can also act as a source of much needed cash flow . <p> Toronto-based Polar Mobile used grants to fund its rapid growth during its early years . The company , which develops applications for tablets and smartphones , has used three government grants to hire on developers since it was founded four years ago . Its client base includes Rogers Communications Inc. , Research In Motion Ltd. and Torstar Corp . <p> Polar Mobile has been growing rapidly as a result of the strong demand for application development in today 's market . Just this summer , the company signed a deal with Torstar Corp 's Metroland Media Group Ltd . The deal will see Polar Mobile design 500 apps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Such big contracts have meant that Polar Mobile has essentially had to nearly double its workforce in the past year , going from 25 employees just one year ago , to 40 today . <p> Kunal Gupta , Polar Mobile 's chief executive , said the grants have provided a welcome source of additional cash flow . His firm has received money from the National Research Council 's Industrial Research Assistance Program , the Ontario Centres of Excellence and the federal Scientific Research and Experimental Development ( SR&amp;ED ) Tax Incentive Program . <p> But while Mr. Gupta speaks highly of the fact such programs exist , he said there is an opportunity to improve grants for businesses in Canada and make them more effective . In Polar Mobile 's case , he said , waiting for grants took anywhere from three to 14 months . For knowledge industries such as software , Mr. Gupta said , projects can be started and finished in that time frame . <p> " If it takes 14 months to get a grant , the impact of that on a business like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The programs are good in their current state , " Mr. Gupta added . " But for programs to really accelerate Canada on a global scale within software and tech , they need to be changed . " <p> Dan Kelly , senior vice-president of legislative affairs for the Canadian Federation of Independent Business , said that red tape is holding back what is otherwise a very impressive array of grant offerings in Canada . While he said there are efficient grant programs in the country -- he cites the SR&amp;ED program mentioned above as an example -- long wait times and overly specific criteria impedes the effectiveness of many grants . <p> " There are some that are ridiculously interventionist and wrong , and then there are other programs that are fairly open and responsive , " he said . <p> Mr. Kelly particularly takes issue with the plethora of industry-specific or criteria-based loans offered in Canada . Grants would be a more effective tool , he said , if they were made less nuanced . Governments should make grants more broadly available to spur more growth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the time it is big businesses that access these programs , because small businesses do n't have the time or inclination to go through the hoops , " he said . " They basically say , ' it 's going to cost me more to access the program than its potential benefits to business . " <p> But of course , that 's not the case for every business . For family-owned Wing 's Food Products , the grant process was smooth and the results clear . The company 's new processing facility sits nearly ready on Kipling Avenue in Toronto . And Mr. Alexander expects it , like its counterpart in Edmonton , to provide local employment for decades to come .

@@4354234 <p> We had little warning . As the " Orange Wave " surged over us , it reshaped the landscape of Canadian politics in ways that few , perhaps none , had expected . Later , we agreed that only Jack Layton could have imagined it . But , on Election Night 2011 , the political winds blew in a storm of shock and surprise : with the Bloc decimated , the Liberals pushed to the fringe , and , most importantly , Prime Minister Stephen Harper 's first majority government . Two of the nation 's most prominent politicians , Michael Ignatieff and Gilles Duceppe , not only led their respective parties to catastrophic results at the polls , but sank with their ships , and lost their own seats in the House of Commons . In the aftermath , both quickly resigned , leaving two of Canada 's most historically significant parties without official leadership , without direction , and without prospects . One brief , seismic moment -- and Canada 's political trajectory took a radical new tack . Quebec traded in its secessionist aspirations for more genuine social-progressive representation ( or maybe just for Jack ) . It really was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May 3rd , the relevant question , was who 's still riding the wave ? <p> The NDP surge in Quebec was astonishing , but what really sealed the province 's endorsement of " Orange " politics was the election of some of Canada 's youngest Members of Parliament to date , all of them New Democrats . Especially telling was the widespread acknowledgment -- on the parts of both the electorate and the elected -- that the NDP had done relatively little , if any , campaigning in many of the ridings it won . Quebec had gone in for ideology . Perhaps it had simply tired of the Bloc 's ineffective federal representation , and opted for the only comfortable alternative . Whatever the reason , the upshot was the election of a fresh cohort of eager , yet politically inexperienced , NDP MPs . Several were students , or on the brink of graduation . As such , these newcomers stood as testaments to an evident truth : they 'd achieved victory neither on personal merit , nor because of the persuasiveness of their own campaigns ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few had any personal connection to their new riding . <p> Four of them were undergrads at McGill . <p> The " McGill Four , " as the national media labeled them , are Laurin Liu , Charmaine Borg , Myl ? ne Freeman , and Matthew Dub ? . ( A fifth McGill student , doctoral candidate Jamie Nicholls , also earned a seat on the Hill . ) Liu and Borg have yet to complete their undergraduate degrees , but , Freeman and Dub ? dove straight from graduation into public office . In other words , until last May , they were all just like us . Or so we like to think . <p> Like many , I was captivated by the story 's sensationalism . Major media seemed in turns dubious and exultant at the prospect of youth in -- really in -- politics . Of course , students and political activism is hardly an unusual blend , but students and political representation -- especially at the federal level -- is more than a little jarring . This is an attitude the ' McGill Four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this piece , I often encountered that attitude . It ran something along these lines : " The election of such young MPs was a fluke . Quebec voted for Jack Layton , or , at a stretch , for the NDP . But they did not vote for the ' McGill Four . ' I 'm all for giving them a chance , but let 's not go so far as to say they earned their seats in the House . Their victories are simply a matter of being in the right place at the right time . " <p> Charmaine Borg , who was taking political science and Latin American studies , is in a better position than most to address the impression that young MPs like her are unprepared or undeserving . <p> Borg won the Terrebonne -- Blainville riding , just north of Montreal , without firing a shot . She ran no campaign to speak of . A local newspaper , Le Train D'Union , spent weeks trying to reach her for an interview , to no avail . They ran a story about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " -- " Have you seen Charmaine Borg ? " Finally , the NDP press secretary in Quebec explained that Borg could n't do an interview because she did n't have a cell phone . <p> After the story ran , the paper finally got a call through to her . But , Borg said she was busy and would have to call them back later . In an updated version of the story online , they concluded , " We 're still waiting . " <p> During and after the election , the NDP faced media scrutiny for a seeming lack of candidate accessibility -- a perception they have since made a large effort to change . But Borg 's aloofness during the campaign did nothing to allay the suspicion that the party was hiding their candidates from view . When I spoke to her , Borg expressed her fervent disagreement with that characterization : " If anything , there was a lack of handling . I certainly would n't say I was shielded . " <p> I played a similar game of phone-tag with the Borg camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was able to get a phone interview with her . She explained her absence during the campaign as the result of being tied up in the campaign of Thomas Mulcair , the Outremont MP who , prior to the election , was the NDP 's sole representative in Quebec . <p> As Borg explains , " It was pretty much all hands on deck for Mulcair . We wanted to make sure he kept his seat , because if not we would n't have anything in Quebec ... We put all of our resources there . " In other words , considering the NDP 's numbers historically in other ridings , they could n't realistically expect to win . So their efforts were better devoted to a campaign with a fighting chance . <p> A quick look at the Terrebonne -- Blainville election returns from the past decade bears out Borg 's initial skepticism . The woman who lost to Borg , Diane Bourgeois , had won the previous four elections for the Bloc . No NDP candidate in that time span had come in better than fourth place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent of the vote , and finished in fifth , behind a candidate from the Natural Law party . In May , Borg won 49.3 per cent of the vote , crushing the incumbent Bourgeois by nearly 20 per cent . <p> To understand how the Four came to stand in the election , I asked them to explain the nomination process . Liu , Borg , and Dub ? were all frank in their replies . Normally , a candidate 's selection is done by a riding association . But , in the case of many ridings , the NDP had such a weak base that these groups were either dormant or nonexistent . So , it fell to the party to seek potential candidates . " I 've been known in the party as someone who 's been very present and very involved , " Borg told me . " So they essentially approached me and asked if I wanted to run . And I agreed . " <p> When I suggest there might be something incongruous about her running in Terrebonne-Blainville , a place to which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she gets testy : " You ca n't be guilty at all . I mean , you 're giving people the opportunity to vote for the NDP . If there was no candidate , then people could n't vote for the NDP , and we would n't have a New Democratic representative , which , you know , 50 per cent of those who voted wanted . So . " She has a point . <p> As we continue talking , Borg mounts a persuasive argument for the value of youth on Parliament Hill . <p> " I think we have to change that whole outlook that a politician has to be a lawyer , or a CEO of a company for forty years , " she said . " Myself , I 've been in the labour environment , and started a drama program for at-risk youth when I was younger . I 've always had an interest in community involvement . And I 'm noticing in my peers -- people who come from all kinds of backgrounds -- those are the people who know what it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about what Jack Layton 's commitment to youth meant to her . In a soft , almost nostalgic tone , she reminisces about her party 's former leader : " He believed greatly in our generation . Before we knew about his second sickness , he wrote an email to us -- to the ' McGill Four . ' We had done an interview , and he was really proud of it , " she recalls . Imitating Layton 's voice , Borg recallls his words : " I had tears of joy , because I 'm so happy that I know our party is going in the right direction , and that you 're going to lead it . " <p> As I learned -- by sitting down with three quarters of the pack , so to speak -- there is a very important sense in which each of these McGill students earned the right to represent . As the election proved , the NDP is a major contender in Canadian politics , and too serious a party to consider fielding candidates it felt were unqualified . With this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or , put more charitably , to assign youth real responsibility ) is heartening . <p> In Ottawa , Matthew Dub ? ' s office is located in the Justice Building , opposite the austere Supreme Court . After passing through security , I 'm whisked through wide , paneled corridors -- lined with MPs ' offices -- to the interior of his new workplace . Empty bookshelves stood along the walls , and his desk was broad and imposing . It looked like office space that had been recently vacated , or not quite moved in to . <p> He 's generous with his time . Finally , late for a meeting , he rushes away . His assistant walks me downstairs , and sees me out . Their professionalism is impressive . <p> A longtime NDP supporter , Dub ? had not bothered to become a member because he was focused on school . One day , he saw a poster on campus advertising a talk by Outremont MP Thomas Mulcair , organized by the NDP campus club . He went on a whim , and loved it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Absolutely , " he replied . " Definitely something that would interest me . " Those members , Liu and Freeman , are now his fellow MPs . Within a year , Dub ? had run for , and won , positions of both co-president in the campus club and president of the youth wing of the NDP 's Quebec section . <p> When the party asked Dub ? , who was completing his BA in political science and history , to stand for election , they took pains to impress upon him the gravity of their offer . " There was n't much drama to my decision , " he says . " Maybe it 's a young , idealistic way of looking at it , but I just kind of threw myself in . And , contrary to what might have been said , you 're always aware -- and they warn you ( as if it 's a bad thing ) -- they do discuss with you the possibility that , regardless of how remote it may seem , when you present yourself as a candidate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ... They really wanted to make sure folks were aware of that . " <p> The discussion turns to his campaign , and , without prompting , he addresses the question on the tip of my tongue . " There was criticism at some points with regard to how active certain campaigns were , " he says . " I know for my part -- I wo n't speak for others -- but the Chambly-Borduas riding is where I 'm from , first of all , which I think dispels one of the myths that everyone was from somewhere else . It 's where I live . " <p> To prove his local roots , he tells me a story . Recently , at a meeting in the city hall of one of the towns he represents , one of the mayor 's administrators pulled him aside . " You know , I went to high school with your dad , " the man teased . <p> But Dub ? goes on to explain that , when it came to campaigning , he simply did not have the resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work with what you have , " he insists . So , he collaborated with other South Shore candidates , did door-to-door canvassing by bike , and gave a couple of local interviews . <p> What did he do when he found out he had won ? " The day after it happened , we were getting organized , returning phone calls , and trying to get everything up and running . " " Being surprised and being prepared are two different things , " he added . <p> Still , for Dub ? , adjusting to life as an MP has been a daunting challenge . He has to juggle countless new responsibilities : selecting staff , setting up two offices ( on the Hill and in the riding ) , becoming familiar with parliamentary procedure , helping constituents access federal services , preparing for debate ... the list goes on . But , he says , " help came from all sides , if we were ready to use it and seek it out . " For one , there was the assistance of " phenomenal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It has n't all been a grind , though . Dub ? recalls an emotional moment this past summer , in which a constituent thanked him for the work he had done on her behalf . After indicating that she 'd felt his absence during the election , she went on to express how grateful she was his team had managed to resolve her issue , and how impressed she was at his first four months in office . ( I asked what the woman 's issue was , but he said he wanted to maintain the confidentiality of his constituents ) . " You know what ? " she said . " I voted for Jack Layton last time , but next election , I 'll be willing to vote for you . " <p> Laurin Liu 's constituency office , in the riding of Rivi ? re-des-Mille- ? les , sits humbly on a main street in St. Eustache , just north of the river and Laval 's southern tip . Getting there by bus from Montmorency takes about an hour and a half from my apartment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brick apartment buildings , a gas station , and a strip mall . The surroundings are bland , but her staff is jovial . ( One of her staffers is Myriam Zaidi , last year 's SSMU VP External ) .

She tells me about the traces of cannon ball fire on the side of the local church , and recommends the flour from North America 's oldest functioning mill . " It 's really important that an MP is accessible and present , " she says , and points to the fact that during the summer she 's done at least six hours of door-to-door canvassing per week . <p> And Liu credits " the huge sense of collegiality " within the NDP for keeping the new , young MPs ( each of whom was assigned a mentor ) reassured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fitting choice , as Leslie was voted " Best Rookie " in a poll of her peers conducted by Maclean 's magazine in early 2009 . <p> As Liu , expressing her frustration with media skepticism , reported : " We always bemoan the fact that youth are n't involved in politics . But when they get elected to Parliament , we complain about it . It does n't make sense . " <p> In a strangely instinctive way , the election of students encapsulates so much of what we both love and despise in a democracy . It reinforces our treasured belief that anything is possible , for anyone . It 's a case of odds overcome , of new people seizing new opportunities , even of marginalized views finding public expression . We want youth to represent vigour and optimism in politics , because those are the qualities we appreciate in youth . And yet , there 's also the voice -- the cynic -- telling us that what matters is concrete experience . Youth does n't mean fresh perspectives , but a lack of perspective . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is the business of running the country , after all . The flipside ( perhaps the perversion ) of the notion that anything is possible -- particularly when coupled with the knowledge that these people were elected not on their own account but solely on that of their party -- is a jealous self-righteousness . It could have been anyone . It could have been you . And then there 's the financial aspect : MPs earn an eye-popping $157 , 000 per annum salary . A voice asks , " are they really worth that ? " <p> But it 's important to remember that these new MPs have come a long way -- possibly longer than they know . Another , now-distant , May election saw a very different result for aspiring McGill politicos .

@@4354236 <h> Activism , Aboriginal Women &amp; Alternative Ideas <h> Andrea Smith Speaks At ConU <p> Violence against aboriginal women is a problem in Canada , and according to Andrea Smith , it is not one that can be understood , studied or solved as an issue in and of itself . " Sexual violence is a tool by which Native people become inherently dirty , and by extension inherently rapeable , " she said , further explaining that a similar phenomenon occurs with Native land . <p> Smith is an intellectual , a feminist , an anti-violence activist , a Nobel Peace Prize nominee , and an associate professor at the University of California , and she is considered an expert on indigenous women 's rights . <p> She believes that violence against aboriginal women is intrinsically related to colonial violence -- and that an inability to link the two is a roadblock to progress . Smith spoke to a jam-packed auditorium in Concordia 's Hall Building last Friday , giving a talk titled Violence Against Native Women and Struggles for the Land . <p> The event was jointly organized by activist groups Missing Justice and Concordia 's 2110 Centre for Gender Advocacy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Word for Gender : An Intro to Feminist Action and Organizing . <p> Smith explained that governments and " the state " are often portrayed as a solution to both the issue of violence against Native women and colonial violence , when they are actually at the root of the problem . <p> She identified a disparity in the distribution of wealth as a fundamental issue with today 's society , which results in a phenomenon she called the " pyramid system . " This reality is such that 95 per cent of the population owns five per cent of the wealth in the United States , and the numbers are n't much different in Canada . <p> " The bad news is that they have all the money and the guns -- but the good news it that there are a lot more of us then them , " she said .

She continued to say that no one needs to completely separate themselves from corporate institutions , but rather that we simply need to strive for alternative ideas and solutions . <p> " It 's really just trial and error . People feel like they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go for it , " she said . <p> Maya Rolbin-Ghanie , who spoke on behalf of Missing Justice , a grassroots organization that meets , plans events , and pressures the government on issues related to missing and murdered aboriginal women , said one of the organization 's goals is to draw the links between native women and the endless struggles for land between First Nations of Canada and the Canadian government . <p> " When someone like Andrea Smith comes and draws a very large number of people the way she did today , the information gets taken in more widely , and can change the way a more diverse group thinks and interacts with the world , " she said . <p> Bianca Mugyenyi , the programming and campaigns coordinator at the 2110 Centre for Gender Advocacy , was personally inspired by Smith and her idea that activism should be accessible and practiced by everyone . <p> " Her approach is really intersectional .

The baby Sens will have considerable skill , size , and talent so there is every reason to expect a return trip to the AHL playoffs and an opportunity to defend their league title . <p> Forwards <p> The baby Sens will rely on Corey Locke to be their offensive catalyst again this season and the plan will be for him to center one of their scoring lines . Other potential candidates to fill the other three center ice slots are returnees Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year pros Mike Hoffman and David Dzuirzynski , who are expected to add significantly to their offensive numbers over the previous campaign . Adding to the mix is MSU alumni Derek Grant who was signed a contract after his sophomore season and joined Binghamton for the tail end of the last season , performing capably , and earned the trust of the coach . Free agent signees Pat Cannone from the U of Miami ( Ohio ) and Wacey Hamilton from the Medicine Hat Tigers along with the speedy UM grad Louie Caporusso will be targeting center ice positions as well so the numbers dictate a few centers will need to contribute from the wing . Highly touted college free-agent signee St ? phane Da Costa from Merrimack College has had a good training camp and may or may not be made available to the baby Sens ; it will depend on how the big club 's roster shapes up . Overall there is considerable offensive ability and character which should make forward a position of team strength . <p> Dynamic Andr ?

Second-year pro Corey Cowick , who had a solid Rookie Tournament in Oshawa , tough-guy Francis Lessard , former KHL and QMJHL winger Maxime Gratchev , and University of Vermont free agent signee Jack Downing will need to find their spots in the depth chart and fight for ice time with the converted centers . Kaspars Daugavins , re-signed in the summer , will also bring additional scoring . <p> Defensemen <p> The baby Sens blueline returns Binghamton rookie-of-the-year Eric Gryba who provides toughness and leadership . Former second round pick Patrick Wiercioch will likely be given an opportunity this season to play an expanded role from the back-end and is expected to man the power-play point and provide more-poised play once he 's returned from Ottawa . Mark Borowiecki , signed out of Clarkson U late last season , has made a favorable impression with the organization in a short period of time and offers the squad a strong presence on the ice . Third year pro Craig Schira had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veteran Tim Conboy will fill another defensive role and minor pros Josh Godfrey and Bobby Raymond will push for playing time and look to fill in should any injuries hit the organization . <p> Both Jared Cowen and David Rundblad are still with the big club and could very well stick . Cowen has played like a veteran and appears ready to start his NHL career . On the other hand Rundblad has been uneven ; impressing with his crisp passing and puck movement but at times looking like a liability with his defensive zone play . One of them will likely be sent down to the AHL before the start of he regular season . <p> Goalies <p> Returning is the talented Robin Lehner , fresh off his first professional season where he spent a majority of the year playing as an AHL backup before leading his team to playoff glory .

Brian Stewart was signed to a minor-league contract and will likely play a majority of the season in Elmira , filling in with the baby Sens as required . <p> Coaching <p> Binghamton will be led again by second-year head coach Kurt Kleinendorst , who experienced good results getting the most out of many players by creating a positive atmosphere and putting them in positions to succeed . Assistant coach Steve Stirling is also finally back behind the bench after having emergency quadruple bypass surgery during the Calder Cup Finals . Tim Murray doubles as the Binghamton GM in addition to his duties as assistant GM with Ottawa . <p> Prospects <p> Jared Cowen had an outstanding training camp and pre-season with Ottawa and made his presence felt on both ends of the ice . Showing poise beyond his years , he was a physical figure in the defensive end , made good decisions with the puck and scored a pair of goals while playing over 22 minutes a game . St ? phane Da Costa has been impressive and may stick with the big club as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same could be said for David Rundblad . Mika Zibanejad has also been nothing short of impressive . In training camp and the preseason the 18-year-old Swede displayed strong skating and hockey sense . He would likely benefit from some time in the AHL but could nonetheless find himself on the NHL opening night roster . Defensemen Mark Borowiecki continued to leave his mark playing solidly against NHL level competition . Derek Grant and Mike Hoffman both had good rookie tournaments , receiving playing in many situations , and got some additional ice time in the NHL pre-season . Young Patrick Wiercioch received valuable experience with his time spent with the Ottawa veterans and had challenges playing against better competition . 
@@4354238 <p> Like a Greek tragedy , the sovereign debt crisis in Greece captivates us with the downfall of the culpable tragic hero whose misbehaviour is disproportionately punished by the wrath of the Gods ( the bond market ) . Yet , the deus-ex-machina of the European Union and International Mondetary Fund bailouts fail to elicit a moment of " catharsis " for most . To learn from this tragedy then , is to understand the circumstance surrounding Greece 's downfall and the unforgiving , sometimes irrational and arbitrary nature of the bond market . <p> A bond is like an IOU where the seller promises to pay the buyer back how much it owes plus interests . In the Greek case , both institutions and individuals bought bonds from the Greek government with the expectation that these bonds would be paid back with interest . <p> In this instance , Greece 's peril can be attributed to three fatal flaws that were aggravated by the bond market : its onerous government expenditure , weakness in tax collection , and an uncompetitive economy . For countries , as for individuals , loans will have to be taken out to make up the shortfall if expenditures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed to keep up -- due in part to widespread tax evasion -- the Greek government had to increase its borrowing by issuing more bonds . Normally , this is n't a cause for concern , as the private sector could pick up the slack . An increasing public debt dwarfed by an increase in national income of greater proportion is n't worrisome . Unfortunately , Greece 's trade volume relative to intra-EU trade is miniscule and stagnant . Access to the EU 's common market did not stimulate Greece to restructure its economy to be competitive and exploit the free flow of goods , labour , and capital . What it offered Greece , though , was cheap credit -- the interest rate demanded from Greece was , at one point , just slightly above Germany 's . With cheap credit also came little pressure to change the status quo . <p> But why were the Cassandras crying foul over the previously ignored situation ? As it were a calibrated political agenda , entrenched in populist sentiments gave rise to the greatest Ponzi scheme ever devised . When credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , panic took over and Greece was suddenly in danger of default . <p> True , Greece is culpable for its own demise . Yet , the arbitrary and irrational nature of the bond market is equally untenable . In assessing the solvency of a country , ( i.e. whether it is able to repay its debt ) bondholders are fixated with a risk statistic known as the debt to GDP ratio . As Robert Shiller articulated it in " Debt and Delusion , " the fixation with the debt to GDP ratio is both arbitrary and irrational . Simple arithmetic tells us the debt to GDP ratio is merely a measurement in units of time . But why are we worried that a nation is not able to pay off all its debt within a year ? Even banks do not expect any homeowners to pay off their mortgages in a year . <p> The sudden lack of bondholder confidence was comparable to a game of musical chairs , where one person changes their behaviour and everyone else panics . Similarly , the sudden stop in Greek bond purchasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leading to a higher interest rate for the Greek government , creating a danger of the Greek government defaulting on its debt obligation . This threat of default forced Greece to accept loans from the IMF and the EU in exchange for austerity measures . <p> The austerity pill Greece is forced to swallow is in a " positive feedback " mechanism that does not do anyone good . Austerity measures depress the economy , which in turn jeopardised the growth prospect of Greece , which in turn made the bonds held by investors fall in value , which leads to the false confidence in austerity measures as a solution . What we 've learned after the housing bust was foreclosures , which depressed house prices further , were actually much more costly than restructuring the mortgages of homeowners . The same lesson can be applied here , demanding pounds of flesh from Greece may be more costly than restructuring its debt ( having matured bonds rolled over into new bonds , negotiating an extended maturity date etc . ) Perhaps the interest of all stakeholders is better served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let Greece get back on its feet again . <p> Keat Yang Koay is a U1 Joint Honours Economics and Finance student .

You can do it . <p> FP:What was your first business ? <p> Jennings : I worked just very briefly out of university at the City of Toronto under ( then-mayor ) David Crombie , who was a visionary . But I quickly realized I was not a bureaucrat , so my very first business was as a town planner . I did that for about three years and worked across the country before I realized it was not what I wanted to do with my life .

But as you do that , you 're also impatient and you realize you usually need more backing . I was fortunate to find some angel investors who were n't focused on the exit strategy , but rather on , " How can we help Christina , both financially and with our advice ? " Often in the early days of a business , you need the banks ' assistance and in our industry the assets are intangibles , like scripts , me -- I 'm an asset -- and I have to say right from the beginning that the banks have been very good to us . <p> FP:Have you relied on government funding at all ? <p> Jennings : Oh yeah .

The way government can make Canada a player in the entertainment industry , which we are becoming and we are becoming a massive job creator , is to help new companies get going . <p> FP:Have you turned to anyone as a mentor throughout your career ? <p> Jennings : There are a couple of people . There are guys on my board I go to on a monthly basis , where I 'm trying to decide , " Should we get into this area ? Should we buy this building ? Should we expand into this market ?

We acquired a company three years ago Smokebomb Entertainment for our digital division , but we do n't own it completely so I am mentoring those two young entrepreneurs .

Sullivan saves the carrot pulp from the juicer and dries it in the oven overnight ; the resulting powder is mixed with a bit of panko for a dusting of extra sweetness . <p> To get pork shoulder about as tender as butter , Sullivan cooks it sous vide it for 24 hours at 63.5 degrees Celsius .

She pins herself as a typical Ladies Learning Code workshopper : grateful to have a friendly space to test out the world of tech . <p> " Not that I would be against working with men , but I like that female-only aspect of Ladies Learning Code , " said Gardner . " I am a somewhat feminist so I like that it inspires women to enter this industry and educate themselves about web development . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having tech skills in today 's workforce . " It 's like math or reading ... no matter what you get into you should be taking some computer science courses in university . " She acknowledged that she 'd like to increase outreach at the high school and university level to persuade women that tech is a viable option . <p> The male-dominated nature of the tech industry serves as a barrier to entry . " I think there 's a general perception that tech is for guys and guys are the hardcore geeks , " said past HTML/CSS instructor Dara Skolnick . " It can be intimidating for a woman to get into a community that 's mostly men . " In fact , for women , increased awareness of their gender can be measurably detrimental to performance in some circumstances . Payne cited a study in which women were asked to identify their gender at the commencement , or end , of a test . Those who were forced to reply at the beginning scored more poorly . <p> This raises a question : why the inclusion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countered " When I think of ' ladies ' I think of classy women , so I think it 's a good fit . " <p> What does seem to have Payne feeling conflicted is their need to rotate between male and female instructors . Payne chose to include men as she did n't want to cut off the supply of talented male teachers , and also because she wanted the workshops to jibe with her philosophy . " What Ladies Learning Code is aiming towards is a more equal industry , " she said . " We need to walk the talk and have an equal number of men and women to be consistent with what we 're looking for in the outside world . " However , she also said that women tend to be more empowered by female-led sessions . <p> In fact , a man led the HTML/CSS September class . Gardner felt " a little disappointed " about this , though Skolnick countered , saying , " The women are there are there to learn , and if the best person to teach it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it . " <p> What Gardner ca n't deny is the wallet-friendly nature of the workshops ( each is approximately $35 , which includes 9 -- 5 teaching , breakfast , lunch , and snacks ) , as well as the personal attention . A lead instructor is always complemented by table-specific assistants . <p> At the moment , Ladies Learning Code is entirely volunteer-run ( both the organizing committee and the teachers donate their time ) and operates on a cost-recovery basis . They 've partnered with the Centre for Social Innovation , which provides event space in exchange for social media marketing support ( the Centre won the mesh prize this year for their mandate to promote initiatives involving women in tech ) . Sponsors such as Well.ca and FreshBooks are on board , with a title sponsor soon to be announced . <p> As for the future of Ladies Learning Code , Payne is resisting calls to bring the initiative to other cities . She says she 's only interested in improving the standing of women in Toronto 's tech community . <p> It remains to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will sustain itself . Payne acknowledged that she 's been lucky to find teachers willing to donate their time , and she recognizes the need to pay these instructors in future , though she 's unwilling to commit to exactly how the organization will evolve . For now , Payne is committed to connecting coding wannabes with the coding training they desire . A WordPress workshop is in the cards , as well as a session on Photoshop . Niche sessions , such as building an online portfolio for photographers , are also a possibility . <p> Payne is definite about one thing . " I do n't think we 'll be doing .

We want to help people get fitter faster , in their own home , with a style of training that you ca n't get from aerobic videos . I guess it depends on the value you put on your health and wellness . If you compare the Ugi at Home system to the purchase of a treadmill , set of dumbbells , bosu , fit ball combined , you actually have quite the deal on your hands .

I am always amazed by people who react to the price point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't hesitate spending $150 on a nice dinner out . " <p> Personally , I do n't think $189 is a lot of money to get in shape when you compare it to other options , like a gym membership or a BowFlex home gym . <p> But the readers ' perception was that they would be paying $189 for a glorified medicine ball . In reality , customers get the ball , a set of five DVDs , a workout guide , an eating right guide , and an iPhone application . <p> But perception is reality when it comes to getting people to take out their credit card . <p> Ms. Karby elaborates on Ugi 's pricing philosophy . <p> " People thought Lululemon Athletica Inc. founderChip Wilson was crazy when he said women would buy a pair of stretchy , black spandex pants for $125 , but hehas managed to sell a lifestyle and a belief that his product is way better than the pair you can get down the street for $45 . How do you keep your premium price point without having to always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competitor comes in and makes one for half the cost ? " <p> Instead of discounting , my suggestion would be to keep the price high to protect their gross margin , and experiment with different offers to improve the perceived value , without adding to their costs . <p> I would suggest testing different Ugi at Home System packages , and checking out the corresponding conversion rate . <p> Personally , I find including " a no-nonsense guide to making good eating choices " and the " free Ugi iPhone app with interval timer " in the Ugi at Home System takes away from the credibility of the overall offer . <p> Most iPhone apps are free or very cheap , and you can get all the nutritional information you want online . <p> Therefore , as a starting point , I 'd actually experiment with reducing the Ugi at Home System bundle to just the meaty items : the ball and a five-pack of DVDs , and see how that offer tests for a week . <p> Then I 'd test adding a 52-week series of online seminars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouragement and tips directly from the Ugi team . The online seminars would be very low-cost for the Ugi team to produce ( all you need is a GoToWebinar account ) and they could add significantly to the perceived value of the Ugi at Home System . <p> Then I 'd dream up a third offer and see if I could trump it with the winning conversion rate . <p> The critical part of arriving at your ideal combination of perceived value is testing . As an e-commerce business , Ugi can easily test various offers by keeping the price point constant and dividing the number of people who buy into the number of people who visit the " shop " page in a given period . <p> Today , if one out of 500 people who visit Ugi 's " shop " page buy , they know their starting point is a conversion rate of 0.2 per cent .

@@4369234 <h> Will Selinger break from Doer tradition ? <h> What we learn about a premier from his cabinet appointments <p> Following his highly efficient majority victory in last week 's provincial election , Premier Greg Selinger is facing some important decisions on who will sit in a cabinet that will serve him and his government for at least the next two years . Will he move quickly to name a new cabinet , or will he show the same cool , calculating delayed gratification of his predecessor , Gary Doer , who showed no stress while seemingly taking forever to make these kinds of decisions ? <p> TREVOR HAGAN / FREE PRESS ARCHIVES <p> Kevin Chief : dynamic newcomer <p> KEN GIGLIOTTI / FREE PRESS ARCHIVES <p> Theresa Oswald : ready for a move <p> RUTH BONNEVILLE / FREE PRESS ARCHIVES <p> Jennifer Howard : growing influence <p> KEN GIGLIOTTI / FREE PRESS ARCHIVES <p> Gord Mackintosh : finance minister ? <p> BRUCE BUMSTEAD / BRANDON SUN ARCHIVES <p> Stan Struthers : another contender <p> Before we can get to the who , there is the issue of when . And in this case , when not only refers to a cabinet shuffle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recall the legislature for a throne speech . Selinger must wait for two judicial recounts to take place in Kirkfield Park and St. Norbert . When those results are confirmed later this month , the premier will likely make it known when the legislature will resume sitting and for how long . <p> The normal fall legislative calendar would normally see the legislature recalled sometime in mid- to late-November , and sit until just before Christmas . It 's typically a housekeeping session , with little in the way of new legislation introduced . The big order of business is the throne speech , which requires nine sitting days to debate and pass . <p> Does Selinger have to reveal a new cabinet prior to that fall session ? If precedent counts for anything , he theoretically does not have to pull the trigger on a full-blown shuffle . In the May 2007 provincial election , then-premier Gary Doer lost competitiveness minister Scott Smith in Brandon West . Doer handed off Smith 's duties to other ministers and then did not fully replace him until the following February . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urgent than Doer faced in 2007 . Finance Minister Rosann Wowchuk and Conservation Minister Bill Blaikie , both strong veteran voices in cabinet , have retired . Their responsibilities could be handed off to other ministers on an interim basis . <p> Finance in particular will be tough to fill . As a former finance minister , Selinger does provide some cover for the portfolio . But it will be difficult for him to do the job of first minister and finance when government is going into stressful pre-budget deliberations . <p> Although all four could likely fill the role , NDP faithful are more excited about the possibilities that Selinger would elevate Howard , a party favourite who has seen her influence grow within cabinet , or Oswald , who has survived five full years of service in the health portfolio . One way or the other , Oswald is almost certainly on the move ; only a premier who really does n't like you would keep you in the health pressure-cooker longer than five years . If a half-decade in government 's toughest job is n't enough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city councillor Gord Steeves has earned her a change of scenery . <p> If both vacancies are filled by veterans , that should create an opening for at least two newcomers . Erna Braun , who won re-election in Rossmere , is apparently on the premier 's radar screen along with rookie Point Douglas MLA Kevin Chief , a charismatic and dynamic new face who many believe will be a future leadership option . Also to be considered is the new Riverview-Fort Garry MLA James Allum , a longtime party militant and well-educated policy wonk who sat on the inner circle of Selinger 's 2009 leadership team . <p> Of course , those are all of the easy decisions . Selinger might find this shuffle is an opportunity to deal with under-performing ministers , or those who manufacture way too many awkward moments to be of further use . <p> Top of that list is occupied by Infrastructure Minister Steve Ashton , the author of several intriguing internal NDP dramas , all stemming from lingering bad blood from the 2009 leadership race he lost to Selinger . The Thompson MLA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective organizer in Winnipeg as well . But he 's also a loose cannon who was alleged to have been the instigating force behind a shadowy campaign to knock off incumbent NDP cabinet ministers at nomination meetings prior to this year 's general election . <p> Ashton 's importance to the NDP ground game is beyond reproach , and for that reason alone it is unlikely Selinger will leave him out of future cabinets . If there is anything Selinger should fear more than Ashton pursuing his own agenda from within cabinet , it is the mayhem Ashton would get up to outside of cabinet . <p> The timing of a new cabinet , and recalling the legislature , will be yet another test for Selinger . Doer had a very strong sense of delayed gratification , pushing decisions about cabinet appointments past the date preferred by the media and his own caucus . The next couple of weeks will show us whether Selinger has that same cool disposition . <p> You can comment on most stories on winnipegfreepress.com .

@@4371235 <p> The first rule of the Secret Smokers Mother 's Club is that you do n't talk about the Secret Smokers Mother 's Club . At least you do n't talk about it to anyone who is a non-smoker and especially to mothers who are non-smokers . <p> Like Alcoholics Anonymous , none of the mothers who secretly smoke are willing to share their names . It makes sense , since many of them have kept their secret for years . " I never smoke in front of my kids . Never . No one in my life knows I smoke , except for one person and that is my husband . But no one else , " says one member . <p> According to reports , one in two smokers hides their habit from friends , family and colleagues . And , boy , do these women go to great lengths to keep this secret from their children . " If Noah is watching television and my husband is with him , I 'll take out the garbage , then run around the house and hide in the bushes , because I do n't even want my neighbours to see that I 'm a mother who smokes . I feel disgusting about it , " she admits . <p> But that has n't stopped her from smoking , even after two children , and she has no plans to quit . " Because you know people judge smokers anyways , but mothers who smoke ? To non-smokers , they 'd consider that worth stoning me . " <p> Club members end up doing a lot of unnecessary chores to get their fix . " I 'll run out to the all-night grocery store , " says one mother . " I 'll tell my husband we 're out of milk , but usually we are anyway . And this store is not close . I do n't go to the store near my house , because I worry I 'll run into people I know . I go to another grocery store that takes me about 30 minutes to get there , so I get a couple of cigarettes in before I go back home . " <p> But do they notice the smell ? These mothers resort to more subterfuge to mask the lingering aroma of smoke . " As soon as I come back from smoking , I wash my hands , my chest , I brush my teeth , and I have clean shirts all over the house , so I can immediately change into one of them , " says one mother . <p> Another member 's purse could be mistaken for an Avon lady 's kit because she has so many supplies . " I keep a small tube of toothpaste and toothbrush . I have a big bottle of body lotion that smells like vanilla . I have face cream that I rub all over my face . And I have a body spray from Victoria 's Secret that I spray in my hair and all over my clothes . " <p> This mother also got a great tip from a makeup-artist friend who sometimes smokes . She now carries around Downy April Fresh or Bounce sheets meant for the dryer . " I rub it on my hair and it works amazingly well . Also , they are really small to carry around , which makes it easier . " <p> If it takes so much energy to keep smoking a secret , why not just quit ? These women know the health risks and they have children they 'd like to see grow up . " It 's the one last thing of my old life , " explains one . " It 's mine and it 's all mine . " Another adds , " Because I sometimes like to be bad , and as a mother you ca n't be bad . " <p> Then there is the dark side of the addiction . " I really love smoking so much , " says one . " I sometimes find that I 'm waiting for my kids to take a nap so I can go smoke . And as awful as this sounds , I 'm excited my son will be going to daycare in the afternoons this fall . " Another admits that when she 's having a nicotine fit , she loses her temper with her children more often . <p> But even though they puff away in secret , they look down on mothers who smoke openly around their children . " When I see a mother smoking , all I can think is , ' You disgusting wretch , ' " says one . " When I see a mother smoking and pushing a baby in a stroller , I 'm horrified . But who am I to judge ? At night , I 'm in the bushes putting out my cigarettes in a beer bottle . " <h> Advertisement <h> Post navigation <h> Give mom a cigarette break <p> this is so true , especially the last paragraph ! I do n't do it on a daily basis but on the rare occasion that I may have a few drinks I instantly crave a cigarette . I tend to always keep a pack on hand like a security blanket , knowing they 're there is enough most of the time . <p> I had a girlfriend once who did n't smoke . She had quit many years before . She got with a guy who smoked a lot and they drank together so eventually she began to smoke when she drank . With in a year she was drinking a lot more than she ever had before and in two years she ended up drinking so much that she had to go to treatment . Can anyone guess why she began drinking so much more than ever before ? <p> That 's right class she had decided she would only smoke when she drank so in order to full fill her ever increasing nicotine addiction and maintain her own self imposed delusional boundary she had to increase her drinking time ! She has made that ridiculous boundary for herself so she would n't fall back into her previous addiction to it . <p> Honestly you are only deluding yourself . Lies are lies are lies and living with a constant lie creates a culture of dishonesty . Your children may not know why you are angry and trying to get away from them so they will internalize those nic fit messages and when they grow up and find out you are lying how are they going to understand what matters to you ? <p> Use the patch or chew the gum and stop being a victim to the tobacco companies which have told you it is too hard to quit and it is the only pleasure you have and it is something oyu give yourself and oyu have a right to some pleasure . <p> None of those things are the truth and that guy who is advocating the addiction is from the industry no doubt or so heavily addicted he is completely stupefied ! Stop that 's all you have to do and in the end you will see clearly that if you were n't addicted to a toxic substance you would have the sense god gave a dog and get away from the stuff . My dog hates being around tobacco smoke .... duh ! Of course it stinks and it makes it hard to breath ! <p> Here is a perfect example of what I am saying right here . What will happen is you do n't have a smoke right then ? We all know what will happen . You will not be able to control your emotions and you will freak out on the kids ! It is happening everywhere everyday and we wo n't stop it for the kids ! <p> John can say anything he wants the evidence is right here that a nicotine addict says " Some situations make me smoke in front of them , " So A:Your boundaries are out the door and B you make it seem urgent so it is that you are so irritaed you are in a rage . That is dangerous and not fair to the children You are addicted and dangerous and you are justifying it in the same delusional lies that you all tell . Get the patch . It will keep your emotions running along as they should be . Steady and not a roller coaster . Addiction and parenting DO NOT GO TOGETHER NO MATTER WHAT ANYONE TELLS YOU IT IS A CRIME AGAINST CHILDREN ! <p> I feel sorry for these mothers who think they are doing some great evil . If you want to smoke , smoke openly . There 's nothing wrong with you . <p> People seem to have no grasp of history . Anti-tobacco and anti-alcohol were the pet obsessions of the Temperance and Eugenics fanatics earlier last century in America ( and Eugenics in Nazi Germany ) . It is these fanatics , these fake moralists , that wreaked havoc and catastrophe . They brought out the worst in people . <p> The current anti-smoking bigotry bandwagon is in the eugenics tradition . The current antismoking assault was decided upon by a group of unelected neurotic bigots operating under the auspices of the World Health Organization . And there is now a lot of money in promoting the bigotry . <p> I agree that addiction is not a moral or ethical issue . But how that addiction is managed is . Unlike the vast majority of smokers , these women are doing everything they can to ensure that they do not harm their families . That is most definitely an ethical choice . <p> For decades smokers have waged a determined hate-fear and loathing campaign against anyone who wanted consideration and responsibility from them . This resulted in what you call the " anti-smoking hate-fear and loathing campaign " and I call the " inevitable backlash to smokers ' contempt and irresponsibility toward others . " It 's never been about smoking or what smokers do to themselves . It has always been about how smokers treat others and their environment . <p> Far from seeing the behaviour of these moms as tragic , I see them as wonderful examples . They prove that addicts do n't have to be irresponsible , selfish jerks . Their families are very lucky to have such caring moms and wives . These women deserve respect , not pity . <p> More delusional thinking and justification and simplification It is an addiction If they were hitting crack but doing it on the sly you would not be so magnanimous and sympathetic . It is the social acceptability of tobacco which is caused by the tobacco lobby which has suppressed opposition and research and the truth It is the same as crack and it should be treated as equally dangerous and in fact it is far more dangerous . <p> How can you say that ? Crack heads hide their addiction from everyone that does not mean they are not suffering from the addiction or being nice to anyone . These Mom 's are exactly like every other Nicotine addict and they will rage when they can not get their drug and they stink when they do get it and they are lying to themselves and everyone else because eventually and more and more often they will lose control in front of and at their children if the children get between them and their fix ! In prisons and airplanes all over the world it has been proven over and over that they can not be separated from their drug for long without freaking out and can you imagine a 2 year old being able to defend themselves or they will internalize the rage and believe they are the problem that Mommy has to get away from right now ! ! ! ! <p> GnomeAlice : Are you getting a little hot under the collar ? Let me know where you got all the answers because I could certainly benefit from knowing everything about everyone and their situation . I am the mother of 3 small children and every night after they are tucked snug in their beds I must admit I sneak outside to the porch to secretly indulge in one cigarette . It may seem ridiculous but this time is all for me and I ca n't imagine giving it up anytime soon . I am also a school teacher and would feel humiliated if anyone in my community or family discovered my late night ritual . I realize the consequences of my actions and have chosen to continue on my path . Is it fair that I am made to feel inadequate because of my guilty pleasure ? Whether choice or addiction why do n't you just cut us all some slack . I do n't publicly judge and ostracize you and yours for allowing your children to watch inappropriate television , play violent video games and have access to social networking sites . ( All of which , in my opinion , are more of a detriment to society than sneaking a smoke here and there , but I will spare you the lecture because I believe ' to each their own ' . ) As responsible members of the community we have been given the opportunity to make our own decisions . As long as we are not hurting others along the way I would suggest that you and like minded others should ' butt out ' . <p> Cigarrettes are made of Tobacco , which delivers the drug nicotine . All nicotine users are drug addicts . <p> Anti-denialist on June 11 , 2012 at 7:40 pm <p> Coffee is made from a bean , which delivers the drug caffeine . All caffeine users are drug addicts . In other words , spare me the resorting to emotional/psychological word games in order to denigrate . It 's transparent . <p> AudreySilk on June 11 , 2012 at 10:33 pm <p> There is no more : " choice " in that addiction then there is in any other addiction . Why do you think you have a choice ? If it was a choice who on earth would chose to smoke tobacco ? ? That is just silly ! You are shooting yourself in the foot . Is it an addiction or a choice ? And there is nothing tragic about the opposition to the poisoning of our streets and planet . The rest of us live here you know . <p> I ca n't believe smokers still do n't get it . No one judges them for their addiction . We are just fed up with the irresponsible and contemptuous way the vast majority of smokers treat the rest of us . If all smokers were as considerate and tolerant toward others and their environments as these moms are toward their families , they would find a huge difference in how they are treated . <p> I have nothing but sympathy for these moms and respect for the lengths they go to in order to protect their families from the consequences of their addiction . I wish all smokers who are n't ready to quit would at least commit to being truly considerate of others and responsible for their behaviour . Addiction can happen to anyone predisposed to it , but at least these women are doing the best they can to avoid harming others . They have nothing to be ashamed of . <p> However I would add that the Mom ; s are going ot have residual negative effects because they sometimes have to get a hit when they ca n't and so then they are going to be volitie and raging and blaming the kids for things and yelling and short tempered until they get the hit so really they are better but not good . <p> U92 , so you think it 's smokers that do n't get it ? It 's actually antismokers and dills that are led by the nose by their inflammatory propaganda that do n't get it . What we are seeing now has all been seen before with catastrophic effect . Antismoking has a long , twisted history . There were two major antismoking crusades last century , one in America produced by the Temperance Movement and , most importantly , Eugenics and the other was later in Nazi Germany produced by Eugenics . <p> U92 , do you have any clue what is actually going on ? Well , let me help you . At the moment , smokers have been tossed out of the indoors , there is the attempt to toss them out of the outdoors , they are being denied access to fostering/adoption , they are being terminated from or denied employment , they are being denied housing -- even the elderly . They are being denied access to medical treatment . They are being charged compounded extortionate taxes . <p> And it has nothing to do with health or facts . It has to do with social engineering -- obsession with control , a favorite eugenics obsession , led by physicians . If you go to earlier crusades , there was a plethora of inflammatory propaganda ( lies ) where the sole intent was for the social engineers to get their way . They are fanatics : They do n't operate by honesty and integrity . Their only goal is to get their way by whatever means . And when the derangement gets rolling , it corrupts everything , beginning with the medical establishment , academia , and government . How much do you think you 've heard over the last 30 years about smoking and environmental tobacco smoke is accurate ? Do you have any idea how claims are arrived at ? <p> Do you ? Where is your evidence John ? Let 's see it . You ca n't really say how it effects me and my kids on the street can you DO I have any rights ? Where is the evidence that I do not have any rights ? And where is your evidence that the WHO is wrong ? Come on let 's see it ! <p> You can not refute the victims of tobacco and nicotine 's real experience of living as victims of nicotine rages and second hand smoke in fact the only reason you can try to dispute anything is because you are a delusional addict and you will do and say anything and dismiss all other arguments to justify your wrong ! You are not suffering from any kind of discrimination and if the tobacco lobby had not had so much power to make profit you would not be addicted and oyu would not be delusional ! Sorry guy but the truth hurts You are a sick puppy who is working backwards for his community . Why defend an addiction that is so obviously dangerous ? BECAUSE YOU NEED IT BECAUSE YOU ARE A CRACK HEAD FOR NICOTINE ! POOR JOHN ! <p> You know how I know Johnny boy ? I was you . And now that I am free I can only feel sorry for you but that will do it right agree or sympathy you do n't care you can make anything into approval ! Is this making you a little hot under the collar John ? I 'll bet it is . <p> The reasons they are being terminated from jobs is because they are bossy and mean and the stink and they have to go out and take 10 minute breaks every 20 minutes and they are irrational if they do n't get to smoke right freaking now and if the foster system have stopped them from having foster kids then we are evolving . Why would we want children in the arms of people who ca n't even control their own addictions ? People who can not tell the truth or even discern the truth ? Any addictions ? <p> Parenting is a responsibility and it is important to role model to children that you respect their rights and addicts do not respect anyone , not even themselves and the are rageful and toxic and you are still delusional John . Lawyers here are not allowed to smoke because nicotine addicts are irrational every 20 minutes It is difficult to get through an interesting class in school if there are addicts there because they agitate for a break and they do n't want to miss anything so everyone has to stop They reduce productivity every where and they make horrible parents who ca n't drive safely and not smoke in the car because their frustration levels are so low that if they ca n't smoke the are dangerous . <p> Please " Nazi 's " lets talk about how it effect me in my own life today John ! I have to walk on the street with my kids through clouds of toxic smoke ! I have to be the victim of the rage a holics if I ask them to stop . People like you who unlike the other crack head believe they have right to pollute my streets . <p> The current antismoking crusade , which continues in the eugenics tradition , was planned in the mid-1970s by a small , unelected , self-installed clique . It involved **26;377;TOOLONG ( a vulgar , favorite technique of eugenics ) and indoor and outdoor smoking bans . And this was years before the first manufactured study on environmental tobacco smoke . The fascist goal is to put so much duress on smokers ( or any other of their targets ) so that they will submit and do as they 're told ; if they do not submit , the State will make life difficult for them . <p> So , U92 , you 'll have to forgive me if I ca n't take you too seriously . At the moment you are clueless , an unwitting bigot maybe , a fake " moralist " . Unfortunately , the deranged social engineers rely on people like you who do n't question anything they say or do and just lap up all the propaganda . <p> U92 , I would strongly suggest you go and study the eugenics that occurred in America and Germany in the first half of the last century . By the 1920s , 33 American states had sterilization laws , Prohibition had been passed , and there was the constant attempt to pass a tobacco version of Prohibition . Eugenics ( physicians , biologists , statisticians ) socially engineering the human " herd " is a dangerous philosophy . What would possess all those American states and then Nazi Germany to embrace this perverse framework ? It was the seductive lie that if society was handed over to the eugenicists , fraudulently promoted as scientific and scholarly , where they would micromanage everyone 's lives that they would put an end to poverty , disease , and crime , using such emotive slogans as " saving lives " and " for the children " . Rather , they brought out the worst in human nature . Note : neo-eugenicists do n't use the word " eugenics " . But if you look at the current obsession with physical health and the belief that that is the entirety of health , that IS the eugenics framework whether they call it so or not . <p> John it does not have to be lengthy to refute your arguments which are quite delusional . It is an addiction not a right and it interferes with my right to enjoy my life without crack heads demanding that I inhale their second hand smoke . I am sure you do not believe crack should be allowed everywhere . <p> The only difference is the tobacco lobby has pushed to make this drug legal but it is not a right or a freedom . It is drug slavery and it kills more people than all other drugs and drunk driving and drinking together . And not only the addicts ! And the nicotine addicted population is wantonly polluting our waterways with toxins and butts Look it up it is the largest source of pollution off the coast and on the beaches of California . If the public or children could chose you would not be allowed to smoke anywhere and it is coming and it is about fraking time I personally am sick to death of your demanding and whining There are real problems on this planet and nicotine addicts are holding us all back . Is that enough John now go back on your meds will ya ! ? Ya said pathetic delkusioanl little addict . You are not responsible for what you are saying obviously or you would never have said that ! <p> John is as delusional as all nicotine addicts ! Make the same case for crack John ! Make the case for why my Grandkids and I should be forced to walk through clouds of toxic smoke and why you and your co horts should be allowed to toss your toxic garbage all ovet the streets and pollute the world and the water ways . That is delusional completely a perfect example when a person begins with a false idea and extrapolates it into a stupid theory to justify their own inability to thin past their addiction . I know booze hounds have all kinds of reason and theories about why they should have the " right " to be whatever kind of dufus they want to be too . There is no right to poison oneself or others . There are zero redeeming socially important qualities to tobacco . Other than making huge profits on your addiction it could be non existent and it should be banned and it will be a controlled substance as soon as we can make it that . You are a tobacco nazi who will do and say anything stupid thing you can to help people fail to overcome their horrible addiction to the drug . Shame on you NO ONE WANTS TO SMOKE TOBACCO ! If it was easy to quit people would not smoke of course . It stinks it makes you mean and stupid and a sociopath . <p> These Moms are delusional if they think the symptoms and the smell and the toxicity are not there because they are hiding and lying ! That is a symptom , the willingness to do something shameful and that leads to more shame and self abuse . QUIT FIND EVERY POSSIBLE WAY TO QUIT YOU ARE NOT FOOLING ANYONE BUT YOURSELF AND FOR THE MAGAZINE TO MAKE IT SEEMS LIKE A CUTE LITTLE HABIT MEANS THEY ARE DOING A TOBACCO COMMERCIAL IT 'S CALLED PRODUCT PLACEMENT ! Any reference to the drug that is positive reinforces the acceptance of it in the delusional addicted mind Shame on you McLeans I guess the writer is an addict or it would not have been so soft and fluffy . No non addict would have been so supportive . This is a very serious problem . <p> ANd they are bad tempered and rough with their children due to nic fits ! Just like air rage only at children and they are running out on their kids and often blaming their kids for them needing to get away ! What are you doing advertising for the tobacco companies . This is not a harmless little addiction . The up and down emotional roller coaster is related to nicotine withdrawal and they are almost always unpleasant and intolerant when there is any stress and they ca n't get to a smoke . I have lived for years with a rage a holic only to find out he is smoking and lying and raging to get out of the house to smoke so exposing us to terrible short temperedness . If these women were honest they would acknowledge this and the pollution and the toxins My goodness this is not a good thing in anyway ! <p> You have an obligation not to endanger your children and to be nice to them . How can you smoke and maintain your addiction when it is not in the best interest of your children and smoking endangers them and lowers their quality of life because yours is lower . <p> If your children could chose they would chose that you do n't smoke ! Shame on you for being so weak and putting a poison before your children . <p> Gnome , take a breath before you flip your neurotic , bigoted lid . With the wild , crazed , sanctimonious comments you are making , you would have fitted in perfectly with the Temperance movement of a century ago . You 're the one who 's way out of control ; you 're spewing bile-filled drivel ad nauseam . If you want to know what 's dangerous , take a good , hard look in the mirror . <p> Name calling does not mean anything . Have some nicotine and get some facts together otherwise you are just an uninformed addict doing your community no favours . Just another crack head who loves crack so much that he thinks it is a benefit to something . <p> You are hooked so your opinion is meaningless and your information is just plain wrong and the reason I piss you off is I am talking about the real here and now daily personal family damage your addiction causes and you ca n't handle the truth . <p> And again if it was crack we were talking about there would be no question that Mom 's should not be sneaking out to smoke it . The times they are a changing . I hope soon crack and nicotine addiction will have the same social standing . If we agree that smokers are nuts on airplanes and in prisons when deprived of nicotine and that they are dangerous what chance does anyone think a three year old in the back seat of a car driven by one of these addicts who is not allowed by law to get a hit in protection of the children ? It is so odd that you think you can just tell someone else that their own experience is not true ! Only a delusional addict could do that . So sad . <p> This is a quote from your argument against a ban on smoking John , " U92 , do you have any clue what is actually going on ? Well , let me help you . At the moment , smokers have been tossed out of the indoors , there is the attempt to toss them out of the outdoors , they are being denied access to fostering/adoption , they are being terminated from or denied employment , they are being denied housing -- even the elderly . They are being denied access to medical treatment . They are being charged compounded extortionate taxes . " <p> I see that you think these measures are a bad thing ! That is why I say you are delusional . When would we foster kids to crack heads or let old people do crack in nursing homes ? And medical resources are for people who are not intentionally killing themselves and making others sick by their own choice ! Most non smokers would question your point . It is not discrimination or any more infringement of your human rights then the " right to drive drunk " . It is a matter of public health and safety and the rights of the non smoking victims of your drug addiction which are littered everywhere in the world . THERE IS NO SOCIALLY REDEEMING TO TOBACCO IT IS ALL ABUSE ! It is a dangerous substance and it make many of us ill and there is no redeemable reason for us to just swallow ! <p> There are no redeeming qualities to a woman not being able to get through the day with her children with out her heart speeding up until she feels as if her brain will explode and trying to care about vulnerable children . IF KIDS COULD CHOSE THERE WOULD BE NO NICOTINE ADDICTION ! It is not fair or just or anywhere near honest and children are not stupid the absorb all of that negative behavior and place it directly upon themselves . You are telling them they are making you crazy and oyu have to get away from them because you feel that way but you feel that way because your body is demanding a drug ! JUST LIKE CRACK and nicotine has serious rage side effects YOU KNOW THAT ! <p> Do you deal in nicotine John that you are helping people stay in this horrible expensive deadly addiction ? What could be wrong with you that your justification is so deep ? You have had these conversations before . Perhaps with those you loved and who once loved you ? You have had to find ways to create approve of yourself . I can tell because I know a couple of other people like you . You have gone so far off the path that you are trying to push young responsible Moms onto the path with you . I am pretty sure you are a lonely old guy with few friends and it is most likely because of this destructive and delusional excuse for your own inability to overcome your own addiction . Good luck with that . <p> Well you 've just dismissed all of your ranting and raving ; your mind-boggling , hate-laden blather-fest is comprised of ONLY name-calling . ( LOL ) <p> Gnome , your mind seems to be running at 100 miles an hour . Are you on something ( multiple things ) ? <p> Gnome : " ..... that your justification is so deep ? " <p> The current antismoking crusade has legitimized all sorts of fanaticism . Fanaticism " normalizes " fanaticism . For example , the current fanaticism has made it appear , i.e. , a destructive illusion , that someone with your thinking has the " moral high ground " . Gnome , I 've got to say that if by quitting smoking someone can become more like you and your " thinking " , then that would be a really good ..... no ... excellent reason to keep smoking . <p> Have you taken that look in the mirror yet ? I hope you are able to overcome your extreme fear and hate . <p> P.S. Feel free to carry on with your long-winded piffle frenzy . After all , someone who understands as much as you with your finger on the pulse of the universe really does n't need anyone else in the " conversation " , certainly not a CRACK HEAD FOR NICOTINE addict that you think I am . <p> Let 's hear you theory as to exactly how Moms for example do not rage when they can not get to nicotine ? Yet anyone else in any other circumstance when they are away from their drug they are raging and violent ? Or let 's talk about my right to live in my city without toxic smoke in my face and those of my grandchildren ? <p> Just answer that any one thing ... how do you think it is ok for you to take away the rights of others and how is it you are selling a bad idea to poor suffering drug addicts . What redeeming qualities are there in tobacco addiction ? What socially redeeming or health or safety qualities are there ? How is it that you believe the stuff you say about nicotine but you ca n't make the connection with crack ? <p> In fact you can not answer my legitimate questions because your opinion is delusional and based in ignorance and you are just trying to justify the terrible losses you have suffered from remaining addicted to the drug and you have zero answers for why the rest of us should suffer from your inability to control yourself ! JUST LIKE CRACK ADDICTS ! <p> Run your self deluding irrational " ideas " past any addictions councilor . You are a normal addict . All addicts tell themselves and try to tell the rest of the world the delusional lies that they have to to allow themselves to continue their addiction . Justifications of your own tobacco addiction that you can not control so you try to make it right but you can not . All of the stuff you say are lies . And you are not really answering anything about the rights of others . You are a bad example for the world . I hope one day you see the error of your ways . You are doing damage to your society but I guess you have to = to make yourself feel as if you are intelligent and important and in control but if you were you would never even do that to yourself much less try to convince others that crack is ok . <p> Funny you say hate as I am not in the least bit hateful nor am I angry I am just right and you are not . In fact I am a loving sweet experienced intelligent giving Grandmother Mom and community activist ex smoker and I contribute enormously to my community especially by being an appropriate role model for those who are struggling with this terrible disease . I am absolutely sure no one would call any of the things I have said to you hateful . Attack all you like you are just proving my point that you are full of rage at anyone who believes something different than you and you have to make stuff up because you ca n't find any real information to prove your point . And buddy said one line and you said it was n't enough so I thought you do n't get it and maybe you need a long explanation . <p> Alice : " Funny you say hate as I am not in the least bit hateful nor am I angry I am just right and you are not . In fact I am a loving sweet experienced intelligent giving Grandmother Mom and community activist ex smoker and I contribute enormously to my community especially by being an appropriate role model for those who are struggling with this terrible disease . " <p> Well THAT is a terrifying thought . Sorry , Alice , but you 're just a bigotry bandwagon jumper . <p> Here 's another question , Alice . How successful do you think nicotine patches , etc. are ? It was fully expected a few decades ago that smokers would simply slap on a patch and they would quit smoking . But it does n't work that way . There 's more to why people smoke than just nicotine . <p> Why ? I hear you ask , Alice . Because " nicotine addiction " is a myth . The myth continues because it makes a lot of money for the pharmaceutical industry for its useless wares and it allows fanatics as yourself to promote themselves as the superior folk -- " role models " . <p> Dear Al , it 's been a sort of pleasure communicating with someone who thinks they 're god . However , you really ought to stop before you make an even bigger fool of yourself -- if that 's possible . You 're the one who sounds like a bona fide rage-aholic , harboring a load of toxic thinking and allowed to masquerade as a " loving sweet experienced intelligent giving Grandmother Mom and community activist ex smoker and I contribute enormously to my community especially by being an appropriate role model for those who are struggling with this terrible disease " . <p> Alice , you are suffering bigotry . Get a grip ; follow the Yellowbrick Road . <p> And again ... just one socially redeeming reason why you would promote the death and demolition that nicotine addiction is on our health care system or our waterways or our children 's rights or even a reason why you smoke ? Anything ? A good or positive or anything ? Economic benefits ? Social benefits ? Personal benefits ? Any pluses for the tobacco companies and any public service they may be contributing ? Or even why you would perpetuate the addiction " value " upon the rest of your community ? Something you personally get from it that makes you a better person ? All you have to say is what a victim you are of those who want some clean air and lack of rage addicts ? <p> You just can not answer that at all . Not one answer at all . Why do I not have the right to not alk through a cloud of smoke ? Why should the people who are protecting children allow someone who is so weak they can not control thier addictions be allowed to be alone with innocent and often already traumatized children ? <p> Or even tobacco use ? ONE POSITIVE BENEFIT ? How is nicotine addiction different that crack addiction ? Just one answer . And the idea that it is not addictive is so silly Who would volunteer to stink and pay tons of money and be angry all the time and need a break from their lives every 20 minutes if they had a choice ? You really believe you are just choosing to smoke and so are the millions of other smokers ? That is hilarious ! And why would they do this ? Because smoking is so wonderful and pleasant ? Hilarious ! <p> No one forces me to inhale tomatoes etc any where I go . Small quantities in eggplant and this means my grandchildren must walk through a cloud of it where ever we go ? Great that it is like caffeine because again my grandchildren are not forced to walk through clouds of caffeine for the sake of other peoples addictions to it . And all of the other issues of caffeine apply actually but no one makes me live with it . Patches . or nicotine administered in even doses over the entire day so as to mitigate the rages and therefore protect children and innocent adults from the withdrawal rages when the addict can not get to the drug fast enough . I do not think I am god I think I am awake and paying attention . I think I live in the year 2011 and I live with the damage I did when I was you . And you know you are living with the damage your theory too . Sad sorry John . it 's ok if you do n't quit . It is just sad that you are pushing the stuff . <p> Answering a question is not an answer . Bigot ? In what way am I a bigot because I disagree with you ? So irrational and still unable to answer credibly even the simplest question which shows that there are no answers John because it is not right or just or ok and you are promoting a poison upon your community . If I was anything like a " what ever you are calling me this time " then I could answer your question but I am not so I ca n't but I do know the answers to the questions I asked you and so do you . Regardless of your alleged facts and history of the addiction you can not tell a lick of truth about why I do not have the right to breath on my own streets and what one redeemable quality to nicotine is ? It seems blatantly obvious that is not clarity of thought because you are delusional . <p> And John people used to be allowed to smoke in Dr 's offices and hospitals and schools I guess with your theory all of the people who did not want to spend their whole day in a cloud of toxic smoke are bigots too ? <p> Seems like a fairly large movement for a fringe element who are all wound up controlling every one else . Interesting conspiracy theory . So it would make all of us smarter if we all smoked is that your idea ? Not a bit delusional there John . <p> And , in fact , Johnny , my friend , I am making a documentary about how seriously addicted some of you are . I could not have met you at a better time . You have made the case for the pros and now I have the opportunity to use your " evidence " in a statement of why you are all delusional . I hope to use you or at least our conversation as an " expert witness " You should think about it , you have set down such a plausible theory or at least as good a one as there ever will be . Consider it . Write a tobacco manifesto and I will publish it . <p> A documentary you say , Alice . How many people get to make a movie ? That 's splendid .... impressive : I could n't be happier for you . I 'm sure you 'll be nominated for the " Legend In Their Own Mind/Teacup " Award . And call me biased but , now having witnessed some of your " work " , I think you 're a cert to win : It 's a one-horse/bigot race if ever there was one . Get that acceptance speech ready , Alice . Just a hint though . From the " Academy 's " website , you 'll have to taper the length down a bit ; speeches over 7 hours are not permitted . And , unfortunately ( they 're very strict about this ) , 3 minutes of the 7 hours has to be devoted to comments other than self-adulation ( This could be very difficult for you but ......... I do n't know ...... talk about the weather for a few minutes -- and then right back to yourself ) . Congratulations in anticipation , Al . <p> Yes , thank you as the creator of over 50 documentary films to date I am hoping this one will be a " breakthrough " in more ways than one . I guess you do n't think anyone can accomplish anything because you have not been able to accomplish even your won freedom . Cheers <p> Oh wait and awards and adulation ? I was the first ever film maker to be awarded the National Film Board 's support for digital animation . I have also won 2 other National awards and you can claim that you justified the addiction of others . Swell . <p> As long as there are no people who ca n't justify their serious drug addiction with anything truthful or even vaguely realistic I will be there . Just one answer John . Just one . Do you LOVE being a nicotine addict . I am guessing that just like all of them you would say " No of course not , I am not an idiot . If I could not smoke I would not smoke obviously . I would rather not poison myself and others but I am hooked and I am too weak to get away from it . " <p> Any answer to any of the questions I asked . Really ? Just for the research you wo n't even try to answer just one ? Oh please . <p> GnomeAlice on October 21 , 2011 at 7:45 am <p> You are such a brilliant example of a hard core addict . SO completely deluded constant misdirection Ca n't maintain a point and no justification for why the rest of us should have to live with it which is why your wife left you and you live alone . No one wants to live with a mean addict who wo n't even question his own addiction . And to live with a pusher would be completely repugnant . Gross ! Ick . <p> GnomeAlice on October 21 , 2011 at 7:48 am <p> Liar , liar , pants on fire ! ! <p> OK . All jest aside ( I AM trying really hard ... LOL ) . <p> Alice , I really do hope that you slap together a " documentary " giggle . In your current state of mind it should be perfect testimony as to why " world fixer " fanatics are dangerously delusional or , to use your superior parlance .... Gross ! Ick ! Icky-poo ! <p> Gosh John I hope one day you are able to see how addicted and fanatical you are about your addiction . So she did leave you because you are an addict did n't she ? And she took the kids because you believe it is ok to poison them and to be a rage a holic . Which it is so obvious you are . Certainly your arguments have fallen away under just s few simple questions . You are not bombastic about it now but rather just trying to be insulting and sarcastic all of which is helping me with my research It is good to have the undivided attention of an addict such as yourself because I can get all of the crazy examples of the addictions tendency to avoidance of any true statement . I really must thank you for yur input and your help . You are a typical deluded nic addict with a series of unrealistic excuses which no outsider can possibly refute because it is a movable feast and when you are pinned down to a realistic question like what about the children who have to walk through your clouds of toxic smoke you can not answer it . Because you know children have a right not to walk through toxic smoke . <p> I am sure when she left your sorry seriously addict death wishing butt she took the kids for their own safety too right John ? Because you are so addicted you ca n't control yourself so you were too mean and erratic and dedicated to the drug to be a decent partner and parent is n't that it John ? And I bet you got fired or laid off because you could n't maintain your cool unless oyu had a death stick hanging out of your face right ? I would so love to get a real interview from you . <p> No worrys ! I do n't slap together anything . I am complete professional and this is a study in how rage effects the children . They have no voice . You can be in a rage at me and say silly stuff that makes no sense and that is the way you all treat children but children can not talk back to adults especially nic addicts because they are mean and agitated and dangerous and hurtful . I am unaffected by your rage and name calling and all of your misinformation because I have been down this road with many of you poor sad addicts and I know that we have a right not to deal with your circular thinking or any discourse at all . People are now beig tested to see if they smoke nicotine and if they do they are warned and if they continue they are let go because people like me fought for our right to be in an office space without smoke hanging in the air and we also have a right to be outside on the streets of our own cities without our children being exposed to your poisonous addiction in the same way we would not work with or walk by a crack head in the street and accept that because the crack head said it is ok for him it is ok for everyone . <p> I really want you to answer some of the questions not because I think you can have an answer that makes sense but because in your head you believe there are answers but when you try to say them out loud or type them you can ; t really say the stuff nicotine makes you think . I could send you a questionnaire . Would that be ok John ? I mean this I really need your perspective . You are dedicated and I am sure you could help a lot . I have all of the stuff you wrote in the beginning and no one knows who you are so why not pour it all out here for me . I Am serious . Do n't be embarrassed and it will help me to make sense of your plight to the world . I mean why would you pollute a child 's space intentionally ? No one would so then what do you think s the reason you believe it is ok for you to smoke anywhere ? Or tell me why , ( I amnot mocking you ) why do you believe it is wrong for the CAS not to allow foster parents who are addicted ? <p> I really want to know John . Who knows maybe I will prove myself wrong . I know a few people who would be happy with that outcome so maybe you could help with that ? <p> I really am making a documentary and this is your opportunity to say all the stuff you believe in public if you like . Be the advocate you were yesterday . The reason I was reading this article was for background information about the addiction and Moms . <p> Here is a link to a few of my music videos ( **35;405;TOOLONG ) 7 in the series on that channel , I have several other channels and much more work out there but no matter . And please do not bother writing a negative critique because I do n't care what you think of my work I just want you to know I am serious . I have been documenting art and music for 30 years . This documentary is going to be my first effort at a feature length . Already have the funidng part started . Just getting some ground work done now . My producers are behind it all the way . <p> It is very hard to talk to the addicts because they get really agitated and they ca n't really think straight so this is a good place for me to be safe and for us to explore the issues you have gathered to make your case . I am going to study the stuff you have given me to try to help you make your case . I will try to suspend my resistance to your model and give you equal time with as objective a lens as I can . What do you think John ? <p> I could be prepared to come to the asylum you are currently being held at . What I want to know is how you managed to hijack the computer at the facility . Are n't there any guards ? If I ca n't make it , just continue with your fantasies and projections . These seem to keep you " entertained " , albeit deranged . <p> Perfect ! Thank you so much ! I mean the more I ask you politely and reasonably to just help the rest of your addicted community to get your message across the more you rage on . You are exhibiting exactly the behaviors I have been mentioning . No real way of address grown up questions so you resort to tossing out meaning less insults which are not insults because A : they are likely projections That is you are really talking about where you are and B : you do not have any real answers that you are willing to actually discuss . You are so typical a nic addict and really the answers to everything I ask no matter how obtuse or angry or attempting to be insulting or hurtful you become it only proves my points completely . When a nic addict " feels " cornered in any way ( meaning they ca n't smoke and type at the same time ) they are angry and insulting not " clear " as your " evidence " has suggested . Clarity would mean you could actually have a conversation . You could discuss things and allow another opinion or opinions without accusing those who disagree with you of being insane . I simply do not agree with your assessment of the drug you abuse . And I have been already working on this piece so it is kind of fortuitous that we have been wrestling over your pro addiction " dialogue " Although you do n't seem to be sustaining any of your previous arguments . You seem to have just reduced yourself to a bundle of anger . <p> I , on the other hand , am smiling and happy because you have given me so much stuff for my research and you are obviously going to continue in your defensive posture without any real point because you are a nicotine addict and that means I have pissed you off a bunch . I am happy because when I came to read this article I was going to have to find someone to try to make the defense and I did not want to sit down with an addict to nicotine and have to challenge the addiction face to face because it is a dangerous interview . Now I have the entire conversation with a die hard addict who until now has not been able to justify his addiction at all . I feel great . Thank you . Anymore ? Just let er rip . I feel very lucky today . <p> Not really There are millions of people who do n't want to deal with that addiction anymore . I did n't stop anyone from smoking in the hospitals or restaurants . I just want a place to go with my Grandchildren where they are not exposed to any addictive and arrogant behavior in their faces and as you must realize I am not alone in not wanting to work with addicts or have to walk out of the hospital to a cloud of toxic waste from someone else 's bad choice . Actually . Just me and my own personal stand for the people who can not tell you themselves that they are afraid of you and do not want to breath your second hand smoke . Nothing like Carrie Nation in fact just my own desire to breath and not be screamed at for it and not have to pay anyone to take 15 minute breaks every 20 minutes . Tired of you and other addicts tossing your refuse on the ground and allowing it to pollute our world . I 'll bet you folks complain about pollution that is not tobacco smoke . Blind and completely unable to think your way out of your self destructive suicidal behavior and next you will say that if you want to kill yourself that is up to you but we put fences on bridges because we try not to allow our citizens to kill themselves . Silly silly silly Do you really think if I was against crack ( which of course I am ) that I would take the crack heads word as to my ambitions or motivations ? Duh ! But if you really are a different guy maybe you will answer some of the questions I have asked John ? <p> If you promise to behave like a sane person and not overwhelm me with 3 or 4 messages all at once , I will answer any questions you like , but one question at a time . I will answer and will in turn ask you a question of my choice . You do n't get an answer to your subsequent questions unless my own is answered first . Let 's show the readership who is the more reasonable here the " addict " or the " fanatic " . I even give you first turn at asking a question . 1 2 3 Go . <p> Should children be required to walk through second hand tobacco smoke on the streets ? <p> GnomeAlice on October 21 , 2011 at 1:41 pm <p> The short answer is yes . The long answer is that children are not kings nor a priviledged species that should be protected from everything their parents ( or grandparents ) wrongly or rightly consider morally or physically wrong for them . The even longer answer is that second hand smoke is not a significant health hazard even indoors , let alone outdoors . <p> Discuss and then answer my question : Do you feel about traffic exhaust and industrial pollution the same way as you feel about tobacco smoke and if so what measures do you take to protect your grandchildren from various pollutants in the outdoors ? <p> CyZane on October 21 , 2011 at 2:22 pm <p> From CyZane : The short answer is yes . The long answer is that children are not kings nor a privileged species that should be protected from everything their parents ( or grandparents ) wrongfully or rightly consider morally or physically wrong for them . The even longer answer is that second hand smoke is not a significant health hazard even indoors , let alone outdoors . <p> Discuss and then answer my question : Do you feel about traffic exhaust and industrial pollution the same way as you feel about tobacco smoke and if so what measures do you take to protect your grandchildren from various pollutants in the outdoors ? <p> Answer : I absolutely protect children and children 's rights from danger caused by unthinking addicted and irrational " adult " behavior and we do socially . We have laws to prevent drunk driving and sexual molesting and crackheads from harming children regardless of the skewed and irresponsible ideas of the drunks , crackheads , molesters and raging nicotine addicts . Do n't you ? <p> My next question is : Do you believe if we worked in the same office that I should be required to live in your ashtray with you or would you be providing anti tobacco order sprays and medical costs for me as required for my asthma to live around the smoke ? <p> So since you have n't answered my question about environmental pollution I understand that it 's not the harm that the pollution may be causing your children that matters to you , it 's who and what produces it and whether the source is morally acceptable or not according to your own standards of morality . Comparing drunk driving to second hand smoke is fallacious . I repeat , until you finally bite and ask the right question , second hand smoke is not a significant health risk even indoors , let alone outdoors . <p> No I do n't believe that if we worked in the same office that you should be required to put up with my smoke even if you were not an asthmatic . I do believe that heavy smoke indoors can cause irritation to the eyes and throat and give a headache to a certain number of people . I do however believe that I should be extended the courtesy of some comfortable accommodation to engage in my pleasurable relaxation and if a well ventilated separate sheltered area that you do n't have to enter unless you chose to still gets to your asthma , then you have a very serious problem which is your responsibility to look after , not mine , nor our employer 's and even less society 's . Do I think that my employer should be obligated to offer me such a room ? No I do n't think so , but happy people make productive employees , and this goes for both of us . On the other hand I do n't believe that it 's the government 's responsibility to forbid employers to accommodate their employees on the use of a legal product . <p> I am very curious why we should make accommodations for smoking nicotine but not crack ? <p> I did answer your question about pollution actually I guess you did n't see it . There is a lot of evidence that you are wrong about second hand smoke and in my own case it is very harmful and it makes children ill . In fact you acknowledge it is harmful by your acknowledgement that it is an irritant.How is drunk driving different Both are addicts who do not care about public health . <p> Anyway once again another one of you is using circular thinking You are a moving target If I know nothing I am the enemy and if I know something then I am the enemy . <p> This should soon devolve into you becoming irate and angry at me because you ca n't believe you are saying the stuff you are . I ca n't believe it but it is all good material for the documentary and I really want to thank you for taking the time to answer these important questions . It is illuminating how truly deluded you folks are but again not a surprise because if you were n't why would you stay addicted ? <p> How does it make all children ill ? Peanuts also make SOME children ill . Are you advocating to ban peanut butter from everywhere you want to take your grandchildren ? Do you also hunt witches that do n't cream their children with cancer causing sunscreen before taking them out to the sun ? Do you lecture parents that drive with their children in badly maintained car and bad weather conditions . Do you think that there should also be laws against that ? How about we hand our children over to the state ( you can hire yourself as a nanny ) to raise them till they 're 18 . That should fix the problem . <p> If people tend to get angry at you is because you 're so one track minded . You do n't even think twice about anything you say and weigh all sides . You just parrot propaganda that you conditioned yourself to believe God only knows why . <p> How did the baby boom generation and their children survive the omnipresent smoke at the time ? Why are today 's children sicker than our own and ourselves used to be ? Why are psychotropic drug use increasing to frightening levels ? What is wrong with this picture ? Yet , if we believe what they say we are only about 20% who smoke now and mostly outdoors where the smoke is thousands times more diluted than indoors . This needs some splaining Alice . <p> And by the way , I have nothing against designated areas for crack users . Providing they are not in the way of anyone they can harm when they 're under the influence , especially children . Now do n't come back telling me that second hand smoke is also harmful . Prove it . Back up your beliefs . And do n't come back with some governmental or anti-smoking sites propaganda . Look up the so called scientific studies , analyze them , evaluate the risk factors and tell me what they mean in real life terms . Are you up to it Mrs. rabid anti-smoker ? <p> Oh , wait ! I forgot I have a better question . I posted one answer to your question with another question but I changed my mind I have three questions but I will ask them in order . I want to mention again that I am recording these results in order to use this material in a documentary . <p> The question or question 2 : If you read the article above and you have the opinion that children do n't need to be protected from the smoke then would you suggest that the Mom 's just smoke when and where ever they like and stop hiding it or do you have another solution or a different idea ? <p> I believe that this should be left up to the individual parent . Parental autonomy is not something to take lightly and for you or I to decide . As long as the child does n't have an ailment that is exacerbated by smoke in which case there are child neglect laws that would protect that vulnerable to smoke child , it is noone 's business . Not yours , nor mine . <p> No I do n't feel the same way about crack . Crack is a drug that impairs cognitive function as opposed to smoking which enhances it . Crack is illegal , smoking is n't . Children could be put in a risky situation if the cognitive functions of their parents are impaired and society then has every right to intervene to protect the children who ca n't protect themselves . I will not ask you any questions although I would have plenty on this issue alone . I 'll catch up first . <p> Tobacco will not be legal for much longer and really because it is legal ? So you are now relaying on the idea that it is ok because it is legal ? Slavery was legal . Beating your wife was legal . We used to be cannibals . So what The legal part of it does not change the symptoms which are very like crack . <p> Sometimes the laws are wrong or more likely they are created by powers that are influencing our government bodies as I am sure you are aware . The laws are changing.You are obviously not self aware . You have lost your temper because you could not get to nicotine and you know you have . Put a child in a room with a nicotine addict who can not get to their hit right away and that child becomes a target of the addict . It happens the the innocent children of nicotine addicts every day . Ask anyone of them that is honest . <p> GnomeAlice on October 21 , 2011 at 7:49 pm <p> You are an insult to truly abused children . You can only wish smoking by one 's healthy child was the only problem our children face today ! I got news for you , there is a forest behind this tree you 're banging your head on . I at least hope that you are busy lobbying government to make tobacco illegal and stop profiting from the taxes that provide for lucrative careers to the whole anti-smoking mafia who do n't really want to eliminate the goose that lays the golden egg . A question for you . How do you explain that there is no legal age to smoke ? Should n't you at least be lobbying for that ? Or are you ? <p> CyZane on October 21 , 2011 at 9:23 pm <p> Interesting . So parents who have children who are " vulnerable " should have different rights than parents who 's children are just normal and there fore in your mind not vulnerable to toxic waste ? You do understand the meaning of the word rationalize right ? <p> Question 3 . Given the expense , the bad odour , the potential damage to your health , the potential damage to the health of others , the terrible withdrawal symptoms every 20 minutes and the social rejection if it was n't addictive why would anyone smoke it or what are any positive qualities of tobacco ? <p> There are plenty of reasons to smoke depending on the individual , the first and foremost being the cognitive functions it enhances . There have been studies suggesting that moderate smoking prevents heart attacks , preclampsia , Parkinson 's disease , Alzheimer 's , alleviates symptoms of ulcerative colitis , has the dual quality of relaxing and exciting depending on the need of the moment , helps with bowel movement , controls weight , controls glucose levels , alleviates boredom and I am probably forgetting a few others . Why do you feel you have the right to decide for another person what is expensive , what is a disagreeable odor and what is beneficial or not for them ? This is not a rhetorical question . I expect an answer . <p> I do not feel I have the right to make anyone do anything for themselves . I do however believe that smokers are not the only people in the world . I also believe in the same rules for equal issues Crack Cocaine has some suggested benefits as well but socially we do not want crack heads babysitting for our kids or being in our public spaces . <p> I did not ask you to stop anything and I have no power to make anyone do anything ... why are you so threatened ? I asked why , if it is not addictive , anyone would choose to be the way nicotine addicts are absolutely proven to behave . Why would anyone who could chose chose to be addicted was the question . I think most smokers would do anything to believe they could quit . It is a very rare smoker who does not wish to be free of the addiction and you know it . <p> I am doing research to see how your brain functions To see if what you are saying about your clarity lines up with the rest of the population smokers and non smokers alike . Why do you feel that if you are challenged someone is trying to stop you from doing something ? <p> You claim you do n't have the right to make anyone do anything for themselves but you 're sure cheering and applauding every regulation no matter how absurd it is . Is n't this a little hypocritical ? You approve of smoking employees losing their jobs , their housing , their children , the privilege to smoke in the outdoors and you will chasticize them when smoking in the presence of their children in the home . I would be doing research to see how your own brain functions before analyzing others ' if I were you . Have you ever read the book Dissecting Anti-Smokers ' Brains ? <p> Why am I so threatened ? All of society is threatened under the influence of people of your ilk . We must put a stop to people with minding such as yours because they 're a threat to sanity and harmony among citizens . Unfortunately too many gullible people believe much of what they read from the so-called authorities . Mindless drones would do anything for utopic longevity whether they finish their days in diapers or not . <p> I approve of laws that protect the public health . I want raccoons to be kept rabies free and I want the public health to help new Moms and I want the public health to advocate for public health . <p> If I poison the water in the city wells because I am careless and people die I want the public health to have a hearing and make public policy to save lives . If the public health says nicotine is bad for people I have to believe them not tobacco addicts who all have a vested interest in self delusion . <p> And as always you are devolving to name calling and insults because you have no defense . Nicotine addiction is indefensible but the smoking of nicotine in public of private is far worse . I do not expect any NAMBLA member to believe child molesting is bad for children <p> Try it they do not agree but as a society we do not agree and as a society the reason you may not smoke where ever you please is because we do not agree . <p> GnomeAlice on October 21 , 2011 at 8:00 pm <p> So which is it Alice that nicotine is bad or smoking is bad ? I thought you recognized the benefits of nicotine and even peddled them here through patches , inhalers , gums or whatever other shit Big Pharma markets to gain the monopoly of the nicotine market . Are you sure you even know what you believe ? By the way , how do you feel about electronic cigarettes ? <p> When did you ask me where I wanted to smoke ? You 're not asking the right questions yet you come to your pre-conceived conclusions . Not what I would call the right qualities to make a good documentary . When did I say that I would like to smoke everywhere I please ? Your credibility is now 0 my most laughable olfactophobic anti-smoker : - ) ) <p> CyZane on October 21 , 2011 at 8:59 pm <p> All of those things are the usefulness of nicotine not smoking ! Sure would like to see some of those studies and understand why the nicotine would need to be smoked to the detriment of others rather than taken in a pill or patch or gum form that bothers no one else ? But then you will say I work for the drug companies trying to sell nicotine patches . <p> You are doing exactly what I asked you not to do if you want to have a half decent discussion with me . I can dig all these studies out for you , but I have at least 4 of your other messages queued for reply . So you either stop overwhelming me or let 's put an end to this discussion . I will get to your other messages and I 'll come back to digging up the studies for you after . But wait till I catch up before you send any other new questions my way . <p> I will happily reply . First it has not been proven that nicotine all on its own is the addictive substance in smoking . Secondly , even if it were , the fastest way to deliver it to the brain is through smoking . The hit is almost instantaneous . Secondly , smoking is not just the act of getting a nicotine hit . The actual ritual of smoking is very important to the smoker and probably the hardest thing to break for those who want to break it . If it were just the nicotine , patches , gums and lozenges would n't have only a between 1,7 -- 7% success rate in the long term . Excellent repeat business for Big Pharma you must admit ; - ) <p> CyZane on October 21 , 2011 at 9:07 pm <p> Question 4 : Who are the millions of non smokers who want their rights associated with , what is our motivation , who are we conspiring with or why would we be saying it is not ok with us ? <p> Yes who are they ? Do you have any figures proving that millions of non-smokers are against smoking ? The anti-smokers which are the minority ( as opposed to non-smokers who do n't care one way or the other ) are people who are being opportunist with the present anti-smoking witch hunt , probably because they dislike the smell , or have seen a relative die allegedly through smoking , or are too tempted to start again . But you 're going way too fast here . You will find out soon enough ( if you ask the right questions ) why ordinary citizens seem to be so anti-smoking . <p> You are serious ? I am very interested in this thinking which I find quite dissociative . I am thinking you do not hang out with very many non smokers or at least they do not hang out with you . How do you think the laws got enacted to stop people from smoking indoors then ? And why I am very curious as to how many people would it take to change all of those laws without the consent of the public and why ? <p> The laws were enacted through cheating , through fear mongering propaganda and brainwashing of gullible people such as yourself or are you one of the professional ones that spew the lies and propagate the fraud . Or do you agree with Repace who claims that it takes gale force winds to dissipate smoke particles from the air in an era where we can easily and efficiently ventilate underground garages , mining sites , welding fumes and highly contagious air in hospitals . Do you even consider what you believe before you spew it ? Stick around and I will give you blatant examples of fraud when enacting smoke-free laws . <p> 1 ) Do you feel about traffic exhaust and industrial pollution the same way you feel about tobacco smoke and if so what measures do you take to protect your grandchildren from various pollutants in the outdoors ? <p> 2 ) Why do you feel you have the right to decide for another person what is expensive , what is a disagreeable odor and what is beneficial or not for them ? <p> 3 ) Yes who are they ? Do you have any figures proving that millions of non-smokers are against smoking ? <p> Absolutely and I actually also work toward a clean environment from all kinds of pollutants I have actually walked across Canada and the US against nuclear weapons for my Grandchildren 's future so yes and I do not drive a car and I do everything possible to eliminate toxins in our environment and so does David Suzuki . Do n't you ? <p> Not sure how many of these you want but the but there were 2,000,000 hits on Childrens rights and smoking <p> It will not matter to you though because with addicted thinking you really believe what you are saying . That is the part I am researching That you can all suffering from the same delusional thinking that you are not hurting anyone . Drunks too and crack heads or no one would do it . <p> Actually I do n't get much chance to go out . I homecare for my 89 year old mother . I work out of my home so I can always be with her and on the weekend I might get to go out a little if I get a replacement so I do n't get to pollute with my car very often . But I am not stupid enough to complain about the window having a crack while the roof is leaking which is exactly what some people do when they complain about a whiff of tobacco smoke while they 're jogging downtown LOL . <p> As for the above sites being so popular . I wo n't look all them up , but here 's a couple : <p> NSRA -- Monthly Users 468 <p> WHO -- Monthly Users 1,536,436 for all the issues that the WHO deal with and internationally <p> Smoke-Free -- Monthly Users 1,196 <p> BePresscom -- Monthly Users 203,194 for all the issues they deal with <p> And this could be both anti-smoking , anti-ban and people just curious or simply lurking . <p> Now can you tell me how many members the NSRA has ? How many does PSFC ? How about ASH -- Alberta ? <p> When and if I reveal to you who I am , we will do a little comparison with the no. of hits I get monthly ; - ) <p> This does n't answer my question of how you protect your grandchildren when you take them out ? Do you make them wear a mask ? Do you keep them in a glass bubble and just roll them around ? If you 're so scared of some tobacco smoke , how do you deal with the rest ? Poor woman , you must be going bananas . You know that stress will kill you faster than anything else do n't you ? <p> It 's ok Cy we think we have all the answers we need . Between you and John we think all of the answers you give would come from all addicted and dedicated smokers . All of the other people we interviewed said they wanted to quit and had tried and mostly talked about the difficulty and agreed with the idea that they are victimizing the rest of us by their lack of control and rage . It is a bit socio-pathic really . Ca n't tell the truth , ca n't hear the truth . ca n't think the truth , too hard to bare and still stay addicted . Too much shame for all the mistakes so it seems better to defend your position.Thanks again to you and John . Really really helpful to not have to be in the same room with you because I am afraid of nic addicts . <p> LOL . Afraid of nic addicts ! I rest my case . So tell me when is the last time you were assaulted in a long airplane flight by a smoker flight attendant or customer ? Sorry if you ca n't be taken seriously no matter how hard I try to turn this into a serious sane conversation ; - ) <p> Oh I am not . I will credit you and this page and this article . Of course ! You folks deserve the credit for all of this stuff and it has been incredibly help to our research . Just the link alone will help but also you rage and ire is also helpful <p> Alice : " And I have been already working on this piece so it is kind of fortuitous that we have been wrestling over your pro addiction " dialogue " ...... " " It 's ok Cy we think we have all the answers we need . " <p> " That WE have been wrestling over " . Who is the " we " ? Are these multiple personalities ? Do you have the entire cast of Alice in Wonderland going on in your mind ? Or are these your **31;442;TOOLONG friends -- the " role models " of society -- helping you compile said " documentary " ? Do you help each other wipe away the foam build-up at each others ' mouths ? Alice , put the Mad Hatter on . <p> Alice : " I want to mention again that I am recording these results in order to use this material in a documentary . " <p> It has a bracket on the end that is preventing it from going to the site . **31;475;TOOLONG and thank you again for your input . I would love to interview one of you in person or send a crew to follow you around for a day to see how you put your citizenship and your addiction into practice .. You folks are a bit more scary then most though so I think I will find a local addict or two . Maybe a couple of Mom 's walking around pissed off at their little kids and are always telling them they have to get away from them and being irritated all the time when they do n't have a smoke between their fingers . <p> I used to have great fun , teasing women because of their habit of talking about soap opera characters like they were real people . Today we have evolved from that to taking the stereotypes created by ad agency pseudo-science seriously . Hatred by entitlement , that tells us we should fell guilty if we smoke or raise our noses to the sky when we see them . Do you really want ad agencies and something they call " Public Health " which stands today as the first line voice the prostitutes of science of payola , by medical officers of health , or their gummy patchy benefactors , to raise your children and set the example they should follow ? One person of interest on this blog emulates what they want others to follow , as useful idiots , although very few from what I see , take her seriously . Do we have to live as hypocrites , self sanctimonious blow hards and bigots just because we do n't smoke ? Not hardly , so what are so many Public health agencies without fear of consequence , so confidently , painting that stereotype for the rest of us ? <p> The truth be told ; we already know the truth about the so called " dangers " of second hand smoke and if you light one up , in a room full of these so called public health experts , they will not run away in fear . because they know the truth as well . They know as we know that the smoke is virtually harmless and that the term " second hand " was an ad agency creation , to sell the community divisions they have gained so far , with smoking bans and regressive cigarette taxation . Created by a daily dose of newsworthy drama and despair , revealed by " new research " , delivered verbatim from the ad agencies to your living room , all dressed up like the news . <p> A politician believes what it is popular to believe among the media and their most often financially conflicted proportions of " political correctness " as a new lifestyle standard . I am a unique person and a free agent , let no one take that from me , or from you . This is about for profit promotion , because science never required ad agencies to help sell the truth . If it is safe to use gasoline and diesel engines or to wear perfume and deodorant or even to have indoor plumbing , tobacco smoke is the least of our worries at the bottom of the list in order of the most immediately toxic aromas we encounter every day . The commercial is getting old and people are getting sick of being told by government how they should live or think . The Government serves us and we are to be respected as adults and we all outgrew our need to be parternalized . Is n't it time at least some of us started to act like we are deserving of the word adult ? If we are truly adults , why do we work so hard at glorifying others around us , who are treating us like we are all helpless children ? <p> Smokers and non smokers always found ways of getting along in the past , is it so hard to imagine that if we are interested in progress , and we do abhor historical bigotry arising from eugenics mindsets . Not unlike what we are witnessing today . If we claim we do reject bullying , coercions and bigotry , can we also walk the talk ? Is it even remotely possible , that we could find that level of human compassion once again ? beyond the promotions of profits or self sanctimonious entitlements you have to find yourself first and set your own standards to live by , under all the window dressings and cheer-leading , who is truly left of those who claim to possess consensus intelligence , for the rest of us ? Dozens perhaps a hundred or so , who are entitled to their entitlements ? <p> To teach Alice the error of her borne again ways , I will have to resort to enlightened poetry . A couple of well know examples come to mind ; <p> Most directly I would cite this one ; <p> " Of all tyrannies a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive . It may be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies , The robber baron 's cruelty may sometimes sleep , his cupidity may at some point be satiated ; but those who torment us for own good will torment us without end , for they do so with the approval of their own conscience . " <p> C.S. Lewis <p> I would be immediately tempted to cite another which more directly describes the banter , however it 's origin stands historically as much more important than the poem itself . so I will offer the link to WIKI in its place ; <p> Your kidding right ? I came here to stimulate a bunch of nic heads into a rage in defense of their horrible behavior and their terrible addiction to a very deadly drug and I got the reaction I expected . What is it you think I should apologize for ? You folks are always so delusional and others can see it . <p> Hey Alice , since you probably have a short attention-span and poor short-term memory , this is just a sampling of YOUR opening comments : <p> " .... that guy who is advocating the addiction is from the industry no doubt or so heavily addicted he is completely stupefied ! Stop that 's all you have to do and in the end you will see clearly that if you were n't addicted to a toxic substance you would have the sense god gave a dog and get away from the stuff . " <p> " You are addicted and dangerous and you are justifying it in the same delusional lies that you all tell . " <p> " Crack heads hide their addiction from everyone that does not mean they are not suffering from the addiction or being nice to anyone . These Mom 's are exactly like every other Nicotine addict and they will rage when they can not get their drug and they stink when they do get it and they are lying to themselves and everyone else because eventually and more and more often they will lose control in front of and at their children if the children get between them and their fix ! " <p> " And there is nothing tragic about the opposition to the poisoning of our streets and planet . " <p> " You can not refute the victims of tobacco and nicotine 's real experience of living as victims of nicotine rages and second hand smoke in fact the only reason you can try to dispute anything is because you are a delusional addict and you will do and say anything and dismiss all other arguments to justify your wrong ! " <p> " You are a sick puppy who is working backwards for his community . Why defend an addiction that is so obviously dangerous ? BECAUSE YOU NEED IT BECAUSE YOU ARE A CRACK HEAD FOR NICOTINE ! POOR JOHN ! " <p> " There are real problems on this planet and nicotine addicts are holding us all back . Is that enough John now go back on your meds will ya ! ? Ya said pathetic delkusioanl little addict . " <p> " John is as delusional as all nicotine addicts ! " <p> " If it was easy to quit people would not smoke of course . It stinks it makes you mean and stupid and a sociopath . " <p> " ANd they are bad tempered and rough with their children due to nic fits ! " <p> No it 's called bating the addicts . If I was a bigot I would be as angry and raging as all you I am researching the reactions of those who promote nicotine . Within that research we needed to arouse the ire of the radical nicotine addicts and we have accomplished our goal quite well I would say . <p> Alice , your opening comments are replete with baseless , haughty , sanctimonious , derogatory claims : They seethe with irrational fear and hatred . That 's the tone YOU set : That 's what YOU BROUGHT to the table . While you can hardly construct a sentence without resorting to baseless inflammatory claims and name-calling , you hyper-react to any questioning of your demonstrably delusional beliefs as " name-calling " . While you engage in a one-sided neurotic and bigoted blather-fest , you accuse others of refusing to engage in a " conversation " . <p> Al , you are a classical fanatic , an extremist . You demand to be taken seriously while you hold to fixed , irrational beliefs , dismissive of anything that does not fit your contorted framework . At this time you are incapable of reasoning . You have obviously spent too much time reinforcing your deranged mindset . You are in need of a complete overhaul of thought . While you would crowingly reserve for yourself the lofty acclaim of " loving sweet experienced intelligent giving Grandmother Mom ....... " , you as emphatically consign , relegate , all smoking parents to the " write-off " basket , guilty of your vile , baseless accusations , until they " reform " to your remedy . You are the fraud . Can it be any surprise that you are terrified of " nic addicts " ? This has nothing to do with smokers or smoke . It has to do with what you have made of them in your convoluted thinking and projections . Then you are shocked that those who smoke would " rebel " at the contorted manner in which you are intent on portraying them , dismissing their protest as only just another " symptom " of " nicotine addiction " . Shame on you ! <p> Alice , if you want to do some useful research , go and find out about anxiety reactions such as phobia , or somatization , or hypochondria , or bigotry , or bandwagon effects . You 'll get a better insight into the amount of work you need to do in your mind : You have much to learn . While you are utterly obsessed with physical health and phantom physical " dangers " , you have a complete disregard for mental health . Children should be protected from fanatics ( e.g. , you ) and the toxic , divisive thinking they spread . <p> " The use of tobacco , in any form , is a dirty , filthy , disgusting , degrading habit .... You have no more right to pollute with tobacco smoke the atmosphere which clean people have to breathe than you have to spit in the water which they have to drink . .... use of the filthy , nasty , stinking stuff tobacco " <p> Alice , does the above quote sound familiar ? These are the sorts of sentiments that are common amongst contemporary antismokers ( e.g. , you ) . Interesting is that the quote above is from an anti-tobacco billboard ( photo circa 1915 ) on the road leading into Zion , Illinois , USA . When considering the sentiments appearing on the billboard , it must be remembered that this was many , many decades before the concoction of secondhand smoke " danger " . <p> Serious , dangerous fanaticism/extremism was rife in America right up to WWII . The Temperance ( fake religious leanings ) and Eugenics ( physicians , physicalists ) Movements , both having dictatorial tendencies and a delusional emphasis on and obsession with physical health , wreaked considerable damage in America . The EM was by far the most influential in America and eventually produced catastrophe in Nazi Germany with global consequences . The Temperance and Eugenics Movements shared the anti-tobacco sentiments in the quote above . While they attempted to change society with destructive consequences , Dowie 's only " redeeming " feature was that he chose to create his own " protected " , " bubble " community . <p> Contemporary " world-fixer " fanatics are like their predecessors . They understand nothing of history ( even recent history ) , science , reason , psychology , sociology , and metaphysics . Whatever the fanatics lay their hands to they contort and corrupt . They jump headlong into derangement , repeating painful errors of only the recent past with the disturbing arrogance of ignorance . It is this sort of fanaticism that is a disgrace . Alice , since it is you that participates in the fanaticism , it is you who should be ashamed at being such easy prey for dangerous superficiality . You and your ilk are cowards , ever enthusiastic to jump on the bigotry bandwagon of the time . This is how , in your shallowness , you convince yourself you are " superior " . Problem is it 's all fakery , fraud , self-delusion . <p> You are going to play very heavily in this piece Johnny my friend You have been the most helpful of all . I wish for you clarity and that you can one day become free and aware of the terrible things you have done to promote this horrible addiction . To Freedom ! <p> These women exemplify the definition of lab rats having been brainwashed by the great anti-smoker experiment . Consider this ... you sit there with your cup of coffee and your young child , curious , asks if he/she can try some . What 's the usual reaction from the parent/adult at this request ? Recoil . " No , " we say , admonishing , " it 's an ADULT drink . " But does anyone feel they have to hide their coffee drinking ? ! ? I do n't want to hear that there 's a " difference " -- that one is " harmful " and the other is n't . That 's not what this instance is about . It 's about misplaced shame over taking part in an adult activity . We do n't want kids to drink coffee as much as we do n't want them to smoke . Think about it . Why else recoil from the coffee request ? Thus it 's only the strength of one experiment over the non-existence of the other ( there 's no anti-coffee crusade ) that is making any difference here . Ladies , better to smoke in front of the kids than to get caught as a liar . The latter makes you look even worse to your kids . <p> No dear they do n't . They only drive their car drunk , they go home and beat their spouse and children up , they vomit all over the place , they pee in their pants , they pick fights in the street , they lose their jobs , they steal to buy booze and eventually die of liver cirrhosis . Fine example to give the children when drinking in their presence ! Am I generalizing and exaggerating ? Of course I am , but that 's just to illustrate what a bigot you are when you generalize about smokers . Now are n't you supposed to go produce a documentary or something ? What are you still doing here ? <p> Simon Chapman , Ph.D. , professor of public health at the University of Sydney , in the January 2008 issue of Tobacco Control , published by the British Medical Journal Publishing Group . The full paper is recommended reading because even if you do n't smoke , you 'll be next should you be overweight , growing older , experiencing health problems , or not eating and exercising in a government-approved fashion . Professor Chapman 's paper identifies the undocumented , yet pervasive , tactics " recommended for comprehensive national tobacco control . " <p> Stigmatization , he explained , is a way to taint a person from being a whole person to one viewed as having blemished , " spoiled " character ; associate them with disease ; and condemn them as being : " malodorous ; as litterers , wasteful and socially irresponsible ; as selfish and thoughtless ; as unattractive and undesirable partners ; as undereducated and a social underclass ; as addicts ; as excessive users of public health services ; and as employer liabilities . " Incredibly , his paper is a veritable blueprint for each tactic , noting that traditional methods have focused on restrictions of smoking and the industry , but a " far wider range of markers of denormalization exist , which are seldom captured . " He urges national control efforts to complement their efforts with these techniques , concluding : " For governments , this negativity foments a public climate that is highly receptive to tobacco control legislation , polices and programs . " <p> Beyond the fact that Alice here , is simply provoking a negative slander against others as she is being paid to do , or as a willing " useful idiot " she does of her own volition . Is the overwhelming reality ; that the same slander and character assassination is being enhanced by the mainstream media and the entire medical community . It goes without saying that charities in promotion of large corporate donations by the people who will profit the most by divided communities , are contributing to an environment that could be described as many things , however charitable is never on that list . Promotion of hatred and spoiled identities , is far afield of what they accept those tax exempted donations to provide . For private individuals and Government agencies they describe themselves as something completely different , in order to qualify for a tax exempted status as a legitimate charity . How on earth did so many intelligent people get duped into such a mammoth payola scheme , gone postal ? Tobacco Control is out of control and it 's harbingers will soon face a huge liability risk , by their direct involvement , as the promotions of hatred and division continue to advance on uncharted ground and spread irreparable damage to our communities in their wake . <p> Negative ads might be highly effective and acceptable in political battles , However when waged on communities and against individuals in coercive ways , they are a crime , and in this case it is a criminal act without question , by the moralist scofflaws with the crooked accusing fingers , who are telling the rest of us how to behave ; the organizations who no longer find it important to earn reputations , when it is far less expensive to purchase one . Governments , Medical Organizations and registered charities , are participating in criminal acts , that need to be prosecuted under hate crimes legislation at the very minimum . People have already died because of this promotion and business losses are approaching the trillions . <p> But thank you , thank you , thank you , Gnome . I would never have been able to do this research otherwise . I 'm terrified of nincompoops . But I 've read all of your off-the-top-of-your-head drivel and I 'm not so scared anymore . So thank you , it 's been great research . Have I mentioned it 's been great research ? Thank you , Gnome , for an insight into people who do n't think before they speak . It 's been so enlightening . Thank you . <p> I do really have to thank all of you I could not have paid for this kind of research . TO find such dedicated addicts is great although all nicotine addicts are just as self deluded you folks are a safe arms length away . I find it interesting that you say I am saying and doing hateful and mean things to you . THat is the " victimization " all addicts feel about the world of non addicted persons . These folks seem to take it extra personally . <p> Thanks you so much . I am sure you realize that the documentary will be anti nicotine addiction and so it was helpful that you spilled the beans but most nic addicts are really addicted so they have to have a philosophy which matches their abuse but they all know if they could stop everyone would not smoke because it is disgusting and pointless and it is done in total disregard for other peoples rights and freedoms and if anyone changeling them they get so irate and rage full that it is very frightening to be an anti smokers rights advocate . But I have to be instead of living my own life because these people will do anything to have their drug and I believe children have the right to have someone advocate for them and their rights . Call me anything you like I am on the side of children and you are on the side of a disgusting , unnecessary and socially harmful toxin and if you could see it you could be free . If you ca n't you will defend it to the death . Very sad I will not be back but I truly do hope you get to see the documentary and you get to learn enough to free you and your families . At the very least I hope you and I can show the world the other reasons Moms should not stay addicted . <p> The reason they will not answer a direct question with a reasonable realistic answer and they get so mad is because they really believe what they are saying otherwise they would be horrified at their own behavior and they would get treatment or just stop . Many of us have had that thinking and then ended our addiction and found out that we were deluding ourselves and that is really all it take to create anti smoker . Reality ! The only real difference they could come up with between crack and crackbacco is that it is legal . Any possible medicinal reasons would mean one could take it orally or with a patch . There is no reason for the nic addicts to be given special space to smoke or to congregate where other lung may be . Thanks again M Smith ED . Global Sync Media Productions <p> If only everyone were so lucky to be exposed to wonderful secondhand smoke more often . My dear Grandmother was a staunch non-smoker who was exposed to plenty of healthy smoke by her husband , she lived to 105 years old . Almost every centenarian can be traced to low dose tobacco smoke , nearly without fail . Cigar and pipe smoking , or low dose cigarette smoking is one of the best tghings you can do for your health along with plenty of Vitamins C , A and choline from eggs and liver . <p> GnomeAlice is SO far out of the know . I almost feel bad for you . You read your excerpts from . gov websites and think you know more than the folks who actually read the studies and form there own conclusions . Your recommendation of nicotine replacement only confirmed my suspicions . Nicorette is so unbelievably primitive . It shows the incompetence and hubris of the medical establishment . The only time ( perhaps 1 of 100 ) it has any effect is the placebo- people who have such a strong fetish for medical doctors and their " ultimate authority " that it makes them stop smoking out of sheer will . Of course the body will try to prevent it , its just so healthy ! The body needs it to run . <p> If Alice is really producing a documentary , this folks is a blatant example of the kind of information that hits your TV screen , your computer screen , mainstream magazines such as Macleans , Reader 's Digest etc ... , mainstream newspapers , on what THEY want you to believe about smoking , very often paying doctors and scientists to ghost sign them and reporters to infocommercialize them . <p> Alice unwittingly makes our point very clear : Do not believe everything you read or hear . Do the research for yourselves and gain back control of your lives . This is n't only about smoking , it 's about everything that corporate , political , and ideological interests want you to buy at the detriment of yourselves , your families and for society in general . They will twist and turn even black on white facts to suit their agenda . Much like Alice claims that " The only real difference they could come up with between crack and crackbacco is that it is legal . " when in fact I personally answered Alice that the main difference between crack and tobacco is that the former impairs cognitive function while the latter enhances it . Maybe Alice should try smoking to help her concentrate on what she reads . <p> Educate yourselves on the issues from all sides , analyze , use common sense and real life experience and NEVER take anyone 's word for it . To answer a question Alice conveniently avoided answering , it takes at least 20 years , if ever , for a heavy smoker to die from a multi-factorial disease suspected to be caused by smoking . How long would it take Alice and her grandchildren to die from hundreds of times diluted smoke in a ventilated indoor space , and whiffs of thousands of times diluted environmental smoke in the outdoors ? <p> So silly like pretesting seat belts or hockey helmets . The reason is because we the non smoker do not like walking through clouds of toxic smoke . You can dramatize and demand all you like crack is illegal for a reason and if you were non smokers you would get it but as a smoker it is impossible for you to stay on the same topic after anyone makes a real point like I do not want to walk through toxic smoke everywhere I go . I have ea right not to walk through crack smoke or be driven over by a drunk driver and those are public health and saftey issues as well . I am thrilled that oyu have done so much research for me though and to have your deluded opinions although we are quite surprised at the radical bent all of the lies you tell have taken . I will not be back because I know you folks rants by now and they will be endless no doubt . All in defense of an addiction that is going to kill you but for sure is making you miserable defensive irrational addicts . Thanks again all ! See ya would n't want to be ya ! <p> Did you need a law to get you to buckle your seat belt or educate your grandchild to wear a hockey helmet ? How pitifully weak of you . Why do you think you 're speaking on behalf of all non-smokers ? How pretentious of you ! You needed the government to make crack illegal to stop you from taking it and educate your children and grandchildren to keep away from it ? How dependant of the government for your well-being ! You do n't want to walk through " toxic " smoke ? Oh phooey , my heart bleeds for you . News flash , life is not about everything YOU want or DO N't want . How about you go live out in the woods and feed from rabies free racoons ? That should keep you happy until you start complaining to the bears that they are pooping all over the place and start a movement against them if they do n't obey to your commands . LOL <p> I see that although you promised that you would n't be back you 're still harping at it and this is why I finally responded to more of your drivel . <p> Actually the NFB and did you notice that you seem incapable of saying anything rational and when pinned down you name call and be sarcastic ? That is a symptom of addiction . I have also asked some of the people I know how are addicted but they think differently then you say you behave They all seems to wish they were not addicted . They want ot stop Your platform seems to indicate that they do not exist . There are millions of addicted people who want very much to get better and it is my intention to help them . You want them to die with you . All drunk driver s think they are righteous . <p> Hey Gnome , you might find this of interest ....... for your research , of course : <p> " ...... the director of Dortmund 's Institute for Labor Physiology ( a Prof. Graf ) argued that tobacco should be entirely banned at the workplace , due to the dangers of ' passive smoking ' .... Jena by this time was a center of antitobacco activism . Karl Astel , director of the new institute , was also president of Thuringia 's Office of Racial Affairs , and rector -- since the summer of 1939 -- of the University of Jena . Astel was not just a notorious anti-Semite and racial hygienist ( he had joined the Nazi party and the SS in July 1930 ) , he was also a militant antismoker and teetotaler who once characterized opposition to smoking as a ' national socialist duty ' . On May Day of 1940 he banned smoking in all buildings and classrooms of the University of Jena ; he soon became known for snatching cigarettes from the mouths of students who dared to violate the ban . One year later , in the Spring of 1941 , as head of Thuringia 's public health office , he announced a smoking ban for all state health offices and all German schools . Tobacco abstinence was , as one might imagine , a condition of employment at Astel 's antitobacco institute : the original proposal sent to Hitler -- written by Gauleiter Sauckel -- noted that this was ' as important as Aryan ancestry ' ; freedom from tobacco addiction was said to be necessary to guarantee the ' independence ' and ' impartiality ' of the science produced . " ( Proctor , 1997 ) http : **57;508;TOOLONG <p> Gnome , you 're in good fascist company . You sound like a MILITANT antismoker . We may even have to consider you for the Karl Astel Antismoking Award . <p> John honey I thought you won ? Is n't the chess game over ? IS n't there a stalemate ? Oh no you deemed that you won and I said that is n't possible because I am many things but none of them are defeated . I am encouraged and I am inspired and I am vindicated by your devotion to the drug in fact I believe this conversation could be the best evidence that you are addicted to a serious drug that makes you unable to think clearly than I have ever seen . I am happy . I mentioned we are having a great time with your answers . Hilarious and all the research you folks have done for us we are ever in your debt . Fascist or not my friend you have provided so much help for us . All those links you have given us . It would have taken us a long time to do all that research . Great I can never thank you enough . Wonderful . In 48 hours you have saved us tons of money and so much time . Thank you Thank you Thank you . <p> Hey Gnome , you " freedom fighter " you giggle , could you explain for the riff-raff like me why anti-smoking/tobacco has , historically , typically been associated with dictatorial ( e.g. , fascist ) frameworks ? <p> TIP1 : You will have to do some actual research and not just listen to the " voices " in your head <p> TIP2 : If you have any sensibility at all ( a long shot , I know ) , it should be dawning on you that you really do n't understand too much at all . You 're just a bundle of fear and hatred looking for a place to spew forth , masqueraded as " saving the world " -- great accomplishment <p> Who cares John I just want you to stop smoking in front of my house so the smoke comes in the window and makes me sick I want to be able ot go to the store with my daughter who is addicted in her car and not listen to her be short tempered and say horrible things to my grandchildren I want ot og to the children 's school and not have to walk through clouds of smoke and I want to go to the play ground and listen to Moms say that they need to get away from their kids because of the kids because that is a lie . <p> They need to get away from the kids to smoke and if the kids get int the way they will not behave like Mothers at all but raging addicts who like the ones on airplane and in jails will not allow anyone to get in between them and their drug . So not working for the CTV or anti tobacco just a private citizen who is tired of addicts delusional thinking that I am somehow required to deal with your toxic addiction everyday ! <p> I am making a documentary about my rights . I am making a documentry titled If kids could chose and it is about parents and their children and how much children really know and see and what they think of their parents addiction and what they think of public smoking . ANd we are making a music video Titled Mama Do n't Smoke Daddy Do n't stink the words to which were written by a ten year old whose Mom has made her feel terrible her whole life because she can not tell her Mom to stop . Her mom becomes very angry and other Mom 's do to . I had a friend who was dying of cancer and her daughter begged her to stop smoking in the house . Her Grandmother had cancer three times and never smoked in her life . <p> This child really wanted some peace for herself before her Mom died . But even in the end she would not give that to her child . That my friend is addicted , not a choice . You can believe what ever gets you through the night but my personal experience is that nicotine addiction is nasty and brutal to live with and the only reason it is not treated the way crack is is because the tobacco industry has a huge lobby and it is very powerful . If the crack industry could get into the white house crack would be legal but it still would not be ok for me to live with it . <p> Alice , in absence of actual scientific data , has seemingly resorted to ad hominem and straw-mans , probably to make themself feel better about their self imposed abstinence from what may is one of the healthiest human practices around . Of course people can become " addicted " to smoking tobacco ( though addiction is typically a term people use to describe things they do nt like ) , just like you are addicted to food , air and social interaction . It is not addiction to practice something that is healthful , pleasuring and normal . The same thing is applied to all sorts of things ; sugar , caffeine , sex , food ( fats , carbs , proteins , meat ) . The bottom line of course , is that these things are not addictive for at the most basic of levels , extremely healthy . It 's radicals like you , along with raw food vegans and zero-carb lunatics , who strive to de-normalize others when in fact they are only trying to shift focus off of their own maniacal perversion of perfectly healthy practices . <p> Um I think I have said repeatedly that I am concerned with my own inability to avoid the stink and the smoke and the bad tempers . <p> Personally I have seen so many Moms abuse their children because they could not get to the drug and all of you advice and rancor is just more evidence that nic addicts are full of rage and anger and will only realize how truly delusional they are . <p> I find it hilarious that so many of you think it is a conspiracy of some sort . <p> I mean you all know I am going to use this against you but you do n't even have the ability to see the train coming . You just rant and rage on . Infantile name calling and silly trivializing as if no one who ever made a film read this magazine . <p> Truly delusional and all over the place . I am this or that or the other thing do you really think I can be insulted into believing that you are not all crazy rage a holics Hilarious . I wish you all could be having the laughs over this stuff that we are . Silly . so angry to keep a drug just like crack heads and heroin addicts and drunks . No reason no ability to hear that you are just wasting your life and poisoning the world . You seem to think others are just crazy that they want to live smoke free . <p> You ca n't because if you do the shame will be over whelming so you persist on over defending a drug that any non smoker will tell you is disgusting and stupid . You are very predictable though . I know because I have been there . I have rationalized smoking in my kids home back in the day and I have struggled with the rage and the withdrawal and the depression but I also know that once you are on the other side you wake up and it hurts to realize how stupid you were . We were taking bets here on how long it would take one of you to say this justification or rationalization or lose it on this idea or that comment . <p> As much as I love reading paragraph after paragraph about your grandchildren , and how you used to smoke , and how smokers are crack addicts ( I am a " non smoker " at this time I should add , for financial reasons ) , you still have n't really stated anything other than that we are akin to hard drug users and drunks . <p> I have an extremely simple request , find a randomized study OR an animal study that shows smoking is deleterious to health . ( Hint ; there are none . Good luck searching ! ) . <p> For the record , I am going to start counting the posts you make without citing a credible ( randomized or animal ) study proving that smoking is deleterious . <p> Interesting that you seem to believe that only studies can tell me that I am sick of being treated badly by addicts and walking through clouds of smoke everywhere I go . I live on Queen street where packs of addicts stand outside the many clubs and smoke until the air is blue with smoke and they toss butts everywhere . It stinks and it hurt the children 's eyes and again I did mention I am interviewing children about how they feel about the smoking their Moms do . What study is it you want me to quote that proves my own experience ? How odd that you think you can demand that .. You folks continue to be hilarious ! <p> And now here comes the questions about cars and exhaust or the questions about nicotine addicts rights and the studies and the junk science . Do n't care Never cared and right now I do n't care twice as much as I never cared before . I am doing a documentary about what the children think about your addiction . We will see what they think after we make the documentary . <p> I am making a documentary about my experience and the experience of children and their Moms . You can tell me that I am going to help the kids form thier opinions or that the society is already bigoted against smokers and so the kids have been brainwashed by public health and the World Health Organization . I do n't really care because any non smoker worth their salt would say you are delusional because you are addicted to nicotine and it makes you not think right . You can not think your way past a smoke . IU hope you all become fre one day but there is little hope for you today . Sad really because you could be so productive if you were n't wasting your life justifying a wrong . You mention the Nazis I think the culture of nicotine we addiction we live in today is like fascism . No other opinions can enter in . Under any other circumstances you folks would very likely be able to carry on a discussion and see a point or an idea of the other person but you must defend you addiction to the death because it would be too embarrassing if you are wrong . If I am wrong then nothing happens but if you are wrong oyu have helped many people remain addicted to a death drug . Shame on you . <p> You are all so funny . No one makes me eat sugar when they eat it or drink when they drink or lose or gain weight when they do . Only tobacco addicts think it is ok to make my self and my grandchildren inhale you toxins No one else . This is more of the circular thinking you folks have we have already busted that myth . Of course no one is trying to make you live your life any way I am trying to stop you from inhibiting my right to chose not to smoke ! No vegans or lo carb people or any of that is interfering with my rights at all . Just you folks . <p> Just like if crack heads were allowed to smoke anywhere they like the smoke would be intolerable . You can keep trying to make this into a big conspiracy but it is really just that it is a disgusting habit that directly effect me and my family negatively . In the same way that socially we stop drunk drivers from driving because it has a direct negative effect on public health and safety . I do not want to walk down the street and be forced to smoke with you and you have no right to expect or defend that behavior . Period . But now you will change the subject because that makes too much sense . <p> The Dill : " I do not want to walk down the street and be forced to smoke with you " <p> Did n't you say that you once smoked , or is this just another of your many lies ? If you once smoked , you should understand the critical difference between smoking and simply being exposed to highly-dilute ambient smoke , bearing in mind that pretty well all of the chemicals in smoke are already in the air generally . <p> This idea of " passive smoking " ( which originated with the Nazis , by the way ) is just another baseless inflammatory term . The term secondhand smoke ( highly diluted ) is OK , but SH smokING or passive smokING are not . There are some nonsmokers who believe that when they are exposed to SHS they are being forced to smoke , that they are effectively smokING . Being exposed to SHS , which is breathing air with highly dilute remnants of smoke , is nothing like smoking . Those who believe they are passively " smoking " have obviously never smoked a cigarette . The quickest way to resolve the issue is to borrow a cigarette , light it , take a drag and inhale the concentrated packet of smoke . That 's smoking . You should notice immediately the incredible difference between smoking and simply being exposed to ETS which can not be equated in any way with smokING . <p> If you are not prepared to test the hypothesis , it should dawn on you that if smoking was simply being exposed to SHS , then why do n't smokers just leave their cigarette lit and breathe the ambient air ? No . They actually take a drag on the cigarette -- a concentrated packet of smoke -- and inhale . That 's smokING . <p> When you are sitting by an open fire , do you believe you 're " smoking " then ? If you 're close-by to lit candles , do you believe you 're " smoking " then ? If you 're close to cooking or BBQ smoke , are you " smoking " then ? Etc . I hope wishful thinking you can see the point . <p> See here we are again John Yes I did smoke and I developed a terrible allergic reaction to it and had to quit and I loved it as much as you and defended it almost as much as you but I was more like most smokers who do n't really WANT to be addicted but they ca n't figure out how to get away because they have help from people like you to remain delusional . I get sick and children get sick and when they are allowed to express their dissatisfaction with it they are very passionate about how much of a problem it is for them . I have 13 Grand kids and NONE OF THEM WANTS TO WALK THROUGH A CLOUD OF SMOKE AND THEY HAVE TO ALL THE TIME ! <p> I AM PRETTY SURE IF YOU ASKED MOST KIDS THEY WOULD TELL YOU IT STINKS AND IT MAKES THEIR EYES HURT AND THEY DO NOT LIKE IT but according to you John they are not kings and so they do n't seem to have the right to choose for themselves in your scenario . I do not like to walk down the street in my own city with my grandchildren because there is smoke everywhere and butts everywhere The Nicotine Addict is the most disgusting addict . Who else tosses their refuse anywhere they want . That is also a problem for the kids they find it really upsetting and my grand kids have never seen a city street that is not covered in cigarette butts . They are everywhere . <p> Keep struggling though this is all good stuff you are putting out there . We are reading the links . Hilarious ! Almost frightening . Heavily funded by big tobacco and as I have said when you do heal you will feel really shameful for a while but it passes Do n't be afraid you can get free . And if any of you Moms out there are reading any of this you know what you are doing is wrong and I am sure you know your kids are suffering from a lot of rage and bad behavior . Ask them what they think of smoking ? Follow their advice they are a lot smarter than this bunch You can get free . These guys are truly hard core community haters . I am thinking they are sitting in there room where they live alone because no one wants to live with smokers other than other smokers and they rarely get along for very long because their hearts are racing every 20 minutes and they have to smoke and that really impedes their productivity and mental ability and time management too . I mean if they did n't spend 20 minutes every 20 minutes smoking think of the free time they would have and all the extra money ! <p> We keep trying to leave but you folks just keep pulling us back in . Wonderful stuff I ca n't thank you enough . <p> So , let 's say you 're an ex-smoker ( which I do n't think you are ) . Why are you then saying that simply being exposed to ETS is the same as being forced to smoke ? That 's a lie . Now you want to tell us that you 're allergic to tobacco smoke . Yet there are no allergens in tobacco smoke to be allergic to . That 's another lie . Then you slip in " butts " . Are you suggesting that you are also " allergic " to butts ? Then your grandkids ( if you have any ) have to walk through a cloud of smoke ALL THE TIME . Then there is smoke and butts EVERYWHERE . Then there is a passing unsubstantiated reference to tobacco industry funding . Then you claim unsubstantiated an impeding of " productivity and mental ability and time management " . Then you claim unsubstantiated a loss of 20 minutes ( in an earlier comment you claimed 15 minutes ) every 20 minutes . <p> Your pathetic claims are parroted from the " markers of denormalization " ( advocacy propaganda manual ) : <p> In addition to SHS " danger " , the major emphases of **26;567;TOOLONG have been -- <p> " Smokers as malodourous stink Smokers as litterers butts Smokers as unattractive and undesirable housemates Smokers as undereducated and a social underclass Smokers as excessive users of public health services Smokers as employer liabilities " http : **49;595;TOOLONG <p> Gnome , you 've spread these over many long-winded , repetitious posts , but you 've pretty well covered all the propaganda points in just one post . You are in the realm of neurosis , manipulation , and bigotry . You 're a pathological liar . You 're either one of the brainwashed or one of the brainwashers . Either way , you 're a sick mind . <p> It has been very useful . Anyone reading these comments should be able to tell the sort of dimwits that become antismoking " advocates " . They parrot from the manual without understanding anything they 're doing . <p> " We keep trying to leave but you folks just keep pulling us back in . " <p> You 've been checkmated numerous times only to respond with more bilge . There 's no need for you to crawl back out from wherever you came with more derangement . <p> Oh I missed that were we playing chess ? Wow you really are delusional I mean of course you really believe what you are saying but I just find it phenomenal that you can think you are in a winning position at all . You are intentionally remaining unaware of the reality of the addiction and nothing anyone says about themselves and their own situation phases you It is like oyu are deaf . You ca n't win or check mate a non smoker What its the prize would I start smoking or start being willing to suffocate from the rage and smoke ? Would I stop defending children ? So silly John and I am sure you are an old guy who sits alone in his room proving to himself that his wife and kids did n't leave him because he is a raging infantile nicotine addict who probably raged his family out of the home for tobacco . <p> I will tell you that your data or evidence makes zero difference other than the lengths nic addicts will go to lie to themselves . I am asking children what they think . How they feel about their Moms I am putting cameras in places that Moms rage at their children to get to nicotine . <p> We are going to track the way the children are addressed when they do bring up smoking to their Moms . <p> Children do not want people around them to smoke . I am advocating a voice for them . You obviously could care less about children 's rights . That is to be expected . You do n't care about yourself or your world because it is a constant threat to your tenuous hold on reality . <p> GnomeAlice on October 22 , 2011 at 10:29 pm <p> Editor 's protected opinion ? <p> I never thought I would live to see the day that CTV and McCleans would side with this type of vile and disgusting professional promoter of bigoted and hateful attitudes . <p> Gnome Alice in full Techicolor , doing what he does best .... <p> Warning the following is highly offensive . <p> I 'm glad she/He is connected and likely paid by Tobacco Control TC advertising budgets . Just goes to show , the type of psychotic and neurotic personality type , that is attracted and aligned with the Bigots who promoted TC . <p> I was born an Americian Jewish Mohawk ( Schmohawk ) in 1949 and .... I really do not understand why what Helen Thomas said about Israel is not just an opinion ? And potentiall somewhat of a valid opinion since nothing has changed since 1949 over there ! <p> I think the Israelis should stop the apartheid and go back to where they came from if they wo n't ! . She did not say what is being reported today that she said ! She did not say they should " go back to the Holocaust " ! Which is what is being reported on CNN ! ! ! She is 89 years old and she is still not entitled to her opinion however it may offend ANY community ! ! ! ? ? ? Maybe at 89 she is tired of the constant bull crap Isreal is perpetrating on the rest of the middle east trying to justify a poor choice that was made by the international community to get Jews out of harms way but they did not intend for Isreal to turn into a monsterous bully terrorizing the entire middle East ! There are many Isrealis and others in the world and in the area who want peace ! But not the US THE ISREALI GOVERNMENT OR THE OIL COMPANIES ! Without Isreal to " defend " the west would have no frickin excuse to be over there at all ! <p> I am sorry I do not agree that the Jewish holocaust was the only holocaust and the ones that have gone on since have been diminished by the demand of those who lived through the one of the 1940 's is the only time we as a species have behaved so badly . We also murdered most of the 500 , 000 , 000 first nations people here and I do n't see any governments anywhere standing up and saying to the US and Canada to stop decimating those populations ! WHy Isreal ? ? ? ? <p> What Israel has been doing since is apartheid and that can shortly amount to a holocaust . Just because a person was assaulted and their family was murdered does not mean that they are the only persons who have ever suffered and that we must all regard that suffering as only theirs and the only suffering ! <p> The second world war and the murder of many many Jews and Gypsies and Ukrainians and many other people was a bad deal for the planets people . We should never do that again but Helen Thomas having the opinion that Israel is out of control and the oppressor is not out of line They should get out of Palestine and stop making war on their neighbors . If they are serious about remembering then they need to remember what happened to them and do not do that to others ! " <p> Excerpts ( but the whole article is a must read on how anti-tobacco operates and why there are so many rabid obnoxious anti-smokers in various forums ) <p> " Whether they are funded by the industry or not , to stay on top of any organized opposition sign up for their mailing lists , preferably using an alias . You can also search online for organizations that oppose your campaign and sign up to receive email alerts , preferably at a home email address or some other location that does n't link you to your position in the coalition . Be sure to share these communications with your key coalition members so that everyone is in the loop and you can collectively decide how to counter the industry most effectively . " <p> ..... submit at least two letters to the editor each month during the campaign , under the names of different authors " . ( page 33 ) <p> ...... A key aspect of any smoke-free campaign is to mobilize the silent majority . Most non-smokers do not speak out against smoking , but you have to tap into their power to win your case ......... For the next few months , strive to ensure there are positive media stories , letters to the editor , etc. , that tout how well the bylaw changes are working . There will no doubt be a backlash from smokers in the beginning until they get used to the changes . In the meantime , you have to counter their negative comments in the media , in comment sections of online news pieces and blogs , on radio call-in shows , etc . Your job is to make politicians continue to believe that they did the right thing . It is not unheard of for councillors to backtrack on their decision and water down legislation . ( page 48 ) <p> ........ Plant stories in the media about non-smokers politely asking smokers to move to a designated smoking area or outside the smoke-free area and smokers complying . Create the impression that the bylaw is working and it will ! ( page 48 ) <p> Malice only believes in tobacco industry conspiracy . All that has informed Malice 's opinion , all of Mal 's " definitions " and incoherent analogies , is apparently " above board " . Is n't that just wonderful . Thank you so much , Mal . <p> He was a Former Chief Editor of the British Medical Journal . Back in 2001 , Smith and supporting associates at BMJ and at 12 other major Medical Journals tried to tell the world that the global medical industry is owned and controlled by the Big Pharmaceutical companies who pay out 100s of millions of ' dollars ' every year to publish junk science studies and reports about their many many products that have serious , even life-long , even lethal , bad side effects , <p> to make those products appear to be safe to take . <p> Smith and everyone who supported him in trying to tell the world about it , got fired . <p> Smith wrote a book about it all that was published in 2006 , " The Trouble with Medical Journals " . <p> And , it 's why you probably have never heard of Richard Smith , because ' they ' do n't want you to know . <p> This global pandemic ' junk science-for-a-buck disease ' has only gotten worse since , gets worse every year than the year before . The more they get away with , the further they push even worse pills . <p> To cover-up , misinform , and misdirect the majority from what they do and are responsible for -- making Billions from making many millions sick , and dead -- it is those very same Big Pharmaceutical companies that spend 100s of millions more every year on more junk science studies and reports and funding , to convince the majority that all the rising illnesses and deaths that they cause -- <p> are wrongly blamed on tobacco instead . <p> And they make a lot of money from that too , selling their bad side effects smoking cessation products that do n't work so people who survive taking them have to keep buying and buying and buying . <p> The Fascist Propagandist : " I will tell you that your data or evidence makes zero difference " <p> You 're now telling us that facts do n't matter ; the " researcher " does n't want facts . Yep , I can accept that facts have no bearing in your vulgar fantasy world . Rather , you 're going to ask brainwashed children who have been indoctrinated in antismoking from an early age in the school system , and who can barely wipe their noses , for their " opinion " ( that 's a variant of the Hitler Youth ) ; " The Children " are usually a key target in a fascist framework . That sounds really smart . Then you want that brainwashed " opinion " of children to be the determining factor in smoking policy for adults . You bigoted nitwits are sinking to new lows . <p> Proctor ( 1997 ) continues that " throughout this period , magazines like Genussgifte ( Poisons of taste or habit ) , Auf der Wacht ( On Guard ) , and Reine Luft ( Pure air ) published a regular drumbeat against this ' insidious poison ' tobacco ........ Dozens of books and pamphlets denounced the ' smoking slavery ' or ' cultural degeneration ' feared from the growth of tobacco use . Tobacco was branded ' the enemy of world peace ' , and there was even talk of ' tobacco terror ' and ' tobacco capitalism ' .... The Hitler Youth and the League of German Girls both published antismoking propaganda , and the Association for the Struggle against the Tobacco Danger organized counseling centers where the ' tobacco ill ' could seek help " ( p.456-457 ) ; " Hitler Youth had anti-smoking patrols all over Germany , outside movie houses and in entertainment areas , sports fields etc. , and smoking was strictly forbidden to these millions of German youth growing up under Hitler . " ( www.zundelsite -- January 27 , 1998. htm ) <p> Creative editing , that 's what it 's called eh ? Is that what you did when you asked me how I felt about parents doing crack by their children and when I said I disapproved because it impairs their cognitive functions as opposed to tobacco that enhances them and because it is illegal , you only chose the illegal part to report to the readership here as to why I disapprove of crack smoking near children ? <p> And did you ever notice I mentioned that my personal experience is that parents who are addicts say and do awful things to their kids and that is all the evidence I need that nicotine addicts have cognitive dysfunction . There is no other explanation for why nicotine addicted parents are so much more aggressive with their children when they ca n't get to a cigarette . I have watched the rage dumped on kids when Moms ca n't smoke every 20 minutes . That is actually why we asked for a model that you folks think would work because we thought maybe we are not hearing what you would accept as a socially negotiated way for everyone to have what they want . Maybe we were being unreasonable about that and if we were we wondered what your model would look like . But we seem to have found some other people who are willing to work out a few possible scenarios . I think you were saying that your work could make a space because you agreed that there is an oder and it can burn some peoples eyes . Or it is an irritant I am not sure we will look back and see . And then apparently some of you think it does not smell bad and it bothers no one and anyone who thinks it does is delusional . So we are pretty far apart on the smoking non smoking issue . <p> Oh Alice , here goes your bigotry again . Many parents lose patience with their kids for many different things . Stop singling out smoking . As I have told you before , if smoking was our only worry . Non-smoking AND smoking separated and overworked single parents , will lose patience for anything and everything . Parents hooked on the internet or a sports game will become irritated when their kids seek conversation and attention . Parents become irritated when they have to drive their kids all over the place , when they are forgetful , when they are disobedient . Need I go on ? <p> But if you still believe that smoking parents that ca n't have their cigarette are the worst , and if you cared so much about it , you would take the time to read some of the literature we are throwing your way to attempt to educate you about the great passive smoking fraud . Environmental tobacco smoke is NOT a significant health hazard to healthy children . THIS is the truth . And if you truly believe that smoking parents are less patient with their kids because they ca n't smoke , then you have noone else to blame but the present anti-smoking fraudulent propaganda and you should be lobbying for your government to get to the truth , condemn the corporate fraudsters and bring peace and harmony back to families . You still have n't commented on how do you think us babyboomers and our children have survived the omnipresnt smoke at a time when even pregnant mothers smoked yet todays 's chidlren are afflicted with all kinds of ailments unheard of in our time . Autism is on the rise , allergies are on the rise , seizures are on the rise , we are medicating chidlren with psychotropic durgs at ever younger ages . If you really cared about the kids you 'd start opening your ears and mind and appeasing smoking parents and reuniting families through exposing the passive smoking fraud at every turn . <p> CyZane on October 23 , 2011 at 1:17 am <p> Ya know we are going to read all of the stuff you folks suggested but I have to tell you I am very involved with many parents and children and I see a huge difference between the rage of the addicted and those who are not . Everyday . You are n't here so you do n't know . I see it as often as the CAS see alcohol . abuse against kids . Otherwise I would be spending my time doing something else because this is too painful But I believe in what I am seeing and doing . You can tell me my own experience is wrong but I think you would not take that from me so you ca n't really expect me to take that from you . <p> Alice writes : " Children do not want people around them to smoke . I am advocating a voice for them . You obviously could care less about children 's rights . " <p> Of course children do not want people around them to smoke . They have been terrorized by anti-tobacco propaganda in their schools and by the likes of you and God only knows what you tell your grandchildren . Tell a child that his mother or father are going to die because they smoke and at first they will believe you . They will spend sleepless nights crying and building hatred around the smoke and baffled why their parents still smoke . But one day when they grow older and their parents and grandparents are still around and healthy and even their great grandparents are still around albeit they were smokers and/or had a smoking spouse , they realize that they have been needlessly terrorized by rabid anti-smokers such as yourself and lose all confidence in anything else you tell them even what might be true . All one has to do is have a look at the youth smoking at the different Occupation movements like Wall Street . Do they look like kids that are afraid to smoke or be around smoke ? Yet they have been bombarded with anti-smoking propaganda right from the cradle . It did n't work . Because they are more intelligent than you give them credit and they can tell parano ? a from balanced education . <p> They have been bombarded with pro smoking role modeling as a romantic and rebellious way to go but not all of the kids at the occupy movement are smokers and only about 25% of people ever begin so you are saying that you would prefer that all of the kids get addicted to tobacco then ? I am just trying ot get it straight that oyu think we are all victims of the anti smoking people and we should all just get some tobacco and smoke it ? <p> So the public health department and the schools and the parents and the medical community and the people in offices and on the job are all part of a conspiracy to make children not smoke and that is a bad thing ? <p> And in NYC as you are aware they ca n't smoke in public so there is also no smoking in that march . <p> GnomeAlice on October 24 , 2011 at 1:52 pm <p> No that 's not what I am saying Alice . Open your mind a little . You are confusing so many issues . I am saying that terrorizing the kids about smoking is not bringing about conclusive results . Kids will smoke if they want to and especially when the propaganda becomes so exaggerated it is no longer believable . Stick to the truth , tell them that smoking is not a healthy habit . But especially that abusive smoking is the worst . Tell them if a smoker can maintain their consumption to about 5 -- 10 cigarettes per day it can even have benefits , but it 's very difficult for many people to maintain it at that level because whether you like it or not it is pleasurable so they are better off not starting . Get off the " no safe level " propaganda . It does n't correspond to their eye-witness experiences . It does n't match real life . They 're not idiots . Tell them that it 's better that they did n't smoke but that if they had to you would prefer that they do it once they 're old enough to weigh in ALL the facts . The present anti-smoking propaganda is making smoking more attractive to them when they get to a certain age because they crave for the forbidden fruit . Get off the high morality horse and treat smoking for what it is , a habit that can be risky for anyone who goes overboard . Smoking prevalence is stalling in Canada and I 'm not a bit surprised . The lies are too transparent , people have stopped believing even what is true . <p> All of these answers are so predictable . And circular . Any question that you guys interpret as possible exposing the truth you avoid . And them you go off on your little jaunt around the bend and come back to the stuff CyZane just said which , if you were being honest you would agree , presupposes there is some danger . In spite of all of your references and denial of any danger . And you also recognized the difficulty of controlling the addiction . You are quite an interesting puzzle . <p> As I have said several time but just to be clear .... for everyone 's understanding , we are feeding you questions we believe we can predict the way a nicotine addict would answer and mostly you are all on target . The only surprise is at the enormous amount of information you have given us in defense of the drug so that is very helpful . <p> GnomeAlice on October 23 , 2011 at 1:55 am <p> I do want to ask John or anyone if they agree or disagree with what you wrote above . really interesting here . I would love to know what John thinks of your above assessment . I almost agree with you on this one . <p> GnomeAlice on October 23 , 2011 at 2:09 am <p> Oh good grief . GnomeAlice you 've been preemptively exposed . A documentary has already been done ... about YOU ( your kind ) . The film " Prohibition " was aired on Public Broadcasting two weeks ago . So go peddle your complaints and accusations to filmmaker Ken Burns and author Daniel Okrent ( " Last Call " on which this film was based ) . Please let us know what they say when you call them " nic addicts that will go to any length to lie to themselves . " <p> Gnome Alice ( which translates to No Malice ) to John , " I thought you won ? Is n't the chess game over ? IS n't there a stalemate ? Oh no you deemed that you won and I said that is n't possible because I am many things but none of them are defeated . I am encouraged and I am inspired and I am vindicated by your devotion to the drug in fact I believe this conversation could be the best evidence that you are addicted to a serious drug that makes you unable to think clearly than I have ever seen . <p> I am happy . I mentioned we are having a great time with your answers . Hilarious and all the research you folks have done for us we are ever in your debt . Fascist or not my friend you have provided so much help for us . All those links you have given us . It would have taken us a long time to do all that research . Great I can never thank you enough . Wonderful . In 48 hours you have saved us tons of money and so much time . Thank you Thank you Thank you . " <p> Gnome Alice and all the folks at Global Sync <p> We will continue to collect your ideas and thought as long as you continue to contribute . Cheers . <p> Oh wait we have a really good question for you . Wait wait We want to know what your boundries would be . If you could chose where you could smoke where would you be allowed to smoke . I want to know this because I want something to tell kids that you might propose as a model for socially acceptable nicotine use . I hope we asked this right . Come on folks time to be proactive . What is the acceptable social model you see as working for everyone ? Be honest ok ? And please think about it it is important . We wo n't hold you to it you can change your minds and stuff but what would a fair and just model loo like in your model ? Ya I know not good at self editing but I am excited and enthusiastic right ? <p> Spit $10 000 and you 'll get your answer . After all this documentary is going to make you rich and famous , is n't it ? You should have asked me while you were still discussing with some relative civility instead of spreading your venom around . It 's not as if I did n't give you plenty of chances to ask the right questions , but you accused me of wanting to smoke everywhere I wanted without even asking . Too late sorry . Stick to your own opinions , it 's the only ones you respect anyway . <p> Okay , suit yourself , if you do n't feel the need to express yourself CyZane then that is fine no one is going to make you . We tried to formulate the question so that it would be easy to answer but we are thinking that none of you will answer that question . I bet 5$ that you would n't but no one would take that bet . too bad for me . I could use 30$ <p> So where are about half a dozen of your millions of non-smoking compatriots to help you out here Alice ? Do you realize that you 're fighting here all alone ? I thought that there were millions and millions of non-smokers unhappy about smoking in the outdoors ? Could n't you get at least 3 or 4 to speak out ? Funny that , you who is such a super duper activist and all ; - ) <p> Oh give it up Alice . Why do n't you just admit that you have a pathological derangement against smoke to the point that just the site of smokers makes you crazy . You 're entitled to your opinion and even to your ailment , what you 're not entitled to is to think that a ) you 're normal b ) that millions of people are like you c ) that you can get government to change policy on a capricious preference you have and especially based on lies . d ) that anyone who disagrees with you is either a delusional addict or someone in the pay of Big Tobacco . <p> I guess I should apologize to you because I have been messing with you . We are trying to provoke you . We wanted to see what you would do and say . I am usually fairly nice but I had to say and do stuff to piss you off so I could extract the voice of the tobacco hmmm well enjoyer .... or I do n't know smoker ? <p> GnomeAlice on October 23 , 2011 at 2:02 am <p> " Gnome Alice ( which translates to No Malice ) " <p> Nice little play on the phonetics . Too bad it makes no sense , i.e. , just another aspect of your delusional state . It 's like crypto-self-deception . Your bigoted rants are ONLY malicious and malevolent . <p> Fascist Propagandist : " Oh no you deemed that you won and I said that is n't possible because I am many things but none of them are defeated . " <p> Translation : I AM god . I do not rely on facts . I am not shackled by facts . I make my own " facts " , I am always " right " , because I am " free " . <p> The only goal now is to expose dimwit fascists ( i.e. , you and " we " ) that do n't understand too much about anything and that have been assaulting society and abusing children with their particular brand of " facts " ( i.e. , neurosis , bigotry , obsession with control ) for quite some time . Thanks for a further insight into antismoking derangement . <p> There 'll come a time , Mal , when people wo n't give two hoots what you and your ilk think , what you claim , what you want , or what you demand . They will have figured out that you 're in a dangerous " la la " fantasy world . May that time come quickly . <p> " I guess I should apologize to you because I have been messing with you . We are trying to provoke you . We wanted to see what you would do and say . I am usually fairly nice but I had to say and do stuff to piss you off so I could extract the voice of the tobacco hmmm well enjoyer .... or I do n't know smoker ? " <p> Alice it 's been an enjoyable experience exposing you , but sorry you now bore me and we are boring the readership . I used this platform to expose how the minds of people of your ilk work and post a few eye-opening links , enough to get the readership curious to look into the fraud further and take back control of their lives . Have fun doing your pseudocumentary . It wo n't be the first nor the last of its kind produced by fanatics and you 're living proof of what I and many others are exposing here and elsewhere . As a matter of fact , save some exceptions produced/published by people with integrity , all of anti-tobacco 's documentation for at least the last 2 decades is nothing but propaganda mostly pimped by Big Pharma . <p> One last link for people who want to examine the tobacco issue under a different dimension . It 's a long read but how enlightening . Authored by Vincent-Riccardo Di Pierri , PhD . The title of the book " Rampant Antismoking Signifies Grave Danger : Materialism Out of Control " It can be downloaded from the internet at : http : **30;646;TOOLONG <p> Interesting . You are a contradictory little sprite you are CY . You own words expose the confusion you have in your own mind about the addiction . Have a wonderful day and life and I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your honest , albeit confused , position . This has been a very enriching experience The film will be released in the spring . I will try to put your screen names on the credits . <p> Alice dear , I ca n't go without setting you straight . You are the one who is totally confused . You went on harping in this forum about you having to walk through thousands of times diluted smoke in the outdoors , that there is no benefits to smoking , that anyone who says anything good about smoking or questions the present anti-smoking crusade is a delusional addict , that moms should not be smoking in the presence of their children . You asked all the wrong questions and predetermined the answers . Not once did you take the time to listen and try to remotely comprehend anything we 're saying . <p> Alice , as John pointed out to you , you are confusing active smoking with second hand smoke and this is where you 're totally off the mark . And as long as you keep confusing the two you will always sound like a misled fanatic . You see , even you agree with what I said above . Now if you can agree with my opinion including that 5 or 10 cigarettes can be beneficial to some people that are disciplined enough to maintain their consumption at that level , how can you go through life being afraid and scaring the daylights out of your grandchildren about whiffs of smoke in the outdoors ? Time to dissect your own brain and beliefs Alice . <p> Straight is that a homo phobic reference Cy ? ? ? Nah just messin cha ! You can " set me straight " all you like , I know what I know and I have been around for a while so I am not really asking for parenting advice or morality classes or even trading mean or sarcastic comments I Am here for exactly what I said I am I have found a treasure trove of typical nicotine user ideas which I needed to round out our research on the BEHAVIOR and socially belligerent arrogance and escalated family violence of nic addicts when challenged or separated from their drug for more than a few moments or even suggesting to get in the way of their addiction .. We will use this information to extrapolate a subtext that is directly against the tobacco industry and the lobbyists for teaching people these lies or what you call your truth . No worries it will all be good in the end . As Cy so beautifully and contradictorily put it I just want children to know it is a dangerous drug and they should avoid it . <p> I want to show the personal distress caused to children by these people if they are even thinking about not being able to " enjoy " their drug freely and I really wanted someone to answer the question of what it would look like what model would you folks accept or would we go back to smoking in Doctors offices ? <p> GnomeAlice on October 23 , 2011 at 3:20 pm <p> And oddly even though you may believe I am going to make a documentary against your drug of choice you keep giving me more ammunition ! I think it is one of you who keeps asking me to give some scientific proof and yet I have told that person over and over that it is n't going to happen but that person keeps asking for the same information . See ca n't think straight ! <p> GnomeAlice on October 23 , 2011 at 3:23 pm <p> Miss the points all you like I am talking about second hand toxic fumes everywhere on the streets and I am talking about the rage you folks exhibit that I do not see in the non smoking public and the inverted un apologetically unhealthy way you treat your world and your community that no one who was n't totally addicted to a drug that changes your thinking would ever want to smoke ! <p> As an ex smoker who knows many ex smokers and those who are trying to become ex smokers I know what I know and you folks are wrong about my experience and I am not anyone but a person just like you and I am underwhelmed by the behavior of smokers that is my truth it does n't make me any of the things you all have called me other than a concerned Mom and Grandmother and no amount of insulting me or talking down to me or pro smoking misinformation is going to change that because I once was you and now I have experienced the truth for myself and I am free . <p> And really ..... I am sorry for all of you . It is very sad and it is too bad that people with so much intelligence and passion are n't defending something valuable and important . My opinion means nothing to you and I am pretty sure mine means something to you or I would be all alone here talking to myself . <p> GnomeAlice on October 23 , 2011 at 7:54 pm <p> " dimension " rather than " perspective " is a perfect word in that sentence . We do believe you are in a different dimension and I think we have said that ! LMAO ! Cy ! I wish you could hear the giggling ! <p> Malice , you 're a rabid antismoking fanatic , familiar with all the propaganda slogans . You might even be a Pharma pimp . When it became obvious you did n't have a leg to stand on , your comments replete with lies and slander galore , you pulled the " I 'm only doing research " stunt . Pathetic ! <p> Looks like you do n't read everything . I answered this . As I have said there is no need for a study this documentary is about my personal experience in my community with the addiction and I do n't believe for a second that just because a person is " not smoking " because you " ca n't afford it " at the moment qualifies them as a non addict . <p> Hmmm are you " still waiting for that " even though I have said very clearly that I am not concerned with the massive amounts of that that you can research yourself if you need to know it ....... I am concerned with the real life suffering I see every day that is happening right here in my own community . If I was making a documentary about the kind of fashion the girls in my community were drawn to I am not sure I would go out and ask a bunch of slobs I do n't know about their opinion . I have also told you this several times . <p> It is not a scientific documentary it is a personal documentary have you ever heard of that ? <p> GnomeAlice on October 23 , 2011 at 3:10 pm <p> From Cy to Gnome : <p> " No that 's not what I am saying Alice . Open your mind a little . You are confusing so many issues . I am saying that terrorizing the kids about smoking is not bringing about conclusive results . Kids will smoke if they want to and especially when the propaganda becomes so exaggerated it is no longer believable . Stick to the truth , tell them that smoking is not a healthy habit . But especially that abusive smoking is the worst . Tell them if a smoker can maintain their consumption to about 5 -- 10 cigarettes per day it can even have benefits , but it 's very difficult for many people to maintain it at that level because whether you like it or not it is pleasurable so they are better off not starting . Get off the " no safe level " propaganda . It does n't correspond to their eye-witness experiences . It does n't match real life . They 're not idiots . Tell them that it 's better that they did n't smoke but that if they had to you would prefer that they do it once they 're old enough to weigh in ALL the facts . The present anti-smoking propaganda is making smoking more attractive to them when they get to a certain age because they crave for the forbidden fruit . Get off the high morality horse and treat smoking for what it is , a habit that can be risky for anyone who goes overboard . Smoking prevalence is stalling in Canada and I 'm not a bit surprised . The lies are too transparent , people have stopped believing even what is true . " <p> Now , come on folks , you have to love this . Here you are stating exactly our premise and yet is would seem you completely disagree with this analysis in you previous discourse . Mostly I would like to know what John or any of the other Pro Nicotine folks think of the above statement . It seems to contradict the research you provided us with . <p> I will repeat here part of what I said in another post because it is more relevant to this post : <p> Alice , as John pointed out to you , you are confusing active smoking with second hand smoke and this is where you 're totally off the mark . And as long as you keep confusing the two you will always sound like a misled fanatic . You see , even you agree with what I said above . Now if you can agree with my opinion including that 5 or 10 cigarettes can be beneficial to some people that are disciplined enough to maintain their consumption at that level , how can you go through life being afraid and scaring the daylights out of your grandchildren about whiffs of smoke in the outdoors ? Time to dissect your own brain and beliefs Alice . <p> Never will answer even a simple direct question even about your own writing . Hilarious ! I will stop calling you delusional because I can see that your delusion is so tied to your addiction that just like all other addicts and delusional people you ca n't possibly see it . <p> Can someone else get a word in here ? Let me say right away that I have no connection whatsoever with the tobacco industry or any similar organisation . Right ? I have read as many of the posts here as I can see . I have seen Alice repeating again and again and again " ADDICTION ! ! ! ! " The Enjoyment of Tobacco is NOT an addiction . There is a definition of ' addiction ' which requires actual physical changes to occur in the addict 's body when he is deprived of whatever substance he is addicted to . Heroin , for example . When a heroin addict is deprived , he starts to sweat profusely , he shivers , his blood constituents change . He suffers ' shock ' and can literally die . No such phenomena have been observed in tobacco deprivation . <p> When I retire to bed , I do not wake in the night desperate for a fag . When I get up , the first thing that I do is make a cup of tea . Only when I have made my tea and washed and dressed do I light a cigarette . When the wife and I go on holiday , we have a six hour period from entering the airport to arriving at our destination when we can not smoke . The period without cigarettes does not bother me . The thought pops into my head from time to time but I pop it out again . The first thing we do when we arrive at our hotel is go to the bar , I order a pint and half of lager , and only when I am comfortably seated do I light a cigarette , The tobacco is most enjoyable . <p> No , the Enjoyment of Tobacco IS A HABIT . If I am addicted to tobacco , then I am even more addicted to tea . <p> I am proud to be a smoker -- that is because I am clearly intellectually superior to the zealots . <p> If gnome could see through his fetish-induced infatuation for medical authority figures , he would see that his stance is simply a self imposed wall to try to trick himself into believing that one of the healthiest human practices is bad for him . Of course he wants to make a documentary about it , to shift focus off of his own " ideas " and to solidify his own maniacal , incoherent and ' round the bend views on such a benign substance ( almost all the looneys do this , in a lot of fields ) . I will feel warm inside when you have to walk through a cloud of *life giving* second hand smoke . And like it or not , you will be better off for it . <p> Sorry I am a bit lost as to whom you are talking to CyZane is a woman and so am I. And I think CyZane is as sincere as you are I think people just do n't realize that we ( many of the people I know and love and many other non smokers and recovering addicts ) do not want it back to the 50s in the 50s one could smoke in the hospital ! Deny it all anyone likes it is painful and an irritant to the eyes and nose of the non smokers . That is not a lie and you all know it . But that is your answer so I respect it I wo n't argue because I just wanted you to answer it . Thank you . So I guess I would want to know why oyu think so many others should have to share your addiction when you would not expect us to tolerate drunks in our offices and they are n't even effecting us physically ? <p> SO odd that because you are one of the rare people who you claim is n't erratic and angry then no one is ? I actually know a couple of nic addicts who can do that but not any of the ones who have extraordinary pressure on them every day The women who ca n't get up and make a leisure tea and relax and go on vacation The ones who are dealing with babies and crisis everyday . And I do n't get it with you folks just having a differing idea makes me a fascist and a brute ? How is that How is it that you feel so threatened ? How is it that you behave in such a reactive way ? Why ca n't any of you carry on a dialogue that includes both opinions ? How is it that you think you win because you name call and put down and demand you fine so everyone is and my own personal experience is what nul and void because you say so ? Funny ideas in a democracy . How is an advocate for non smoking such an enemy and a conspirator against you all and a Nazi and in cahoots with goodness knows what big corporation or just an ignorant know nothing You are silly . You can not answer a direct question that would make you agree yet CyZane did Cy zane readily admits it is addictive and it is not good for kinds and we should try to get kids not to smoke CyZane just wants us not to tell them their parents are going ot die which in my personal experience I have no idea why anyone would tell their kids that unless their parents are going to die . You there is it that you are saying it is not addictive ? Or it does not cause anyone to have stress under any circumstances ? Or that it should be allowed everywhere ? What is your point other than that you believe you are not offensive when you smoke ? Are you saying it is completely fine and we should go back to smoking in hospitals because you believe it is n't bothering anyone else that you smoke on your vacation ? Should we be allowed to smoke in an enclosed space with children ? Is it an innocent fragrance which everyone would accept if the big non smoking lobbies were n't out there pushing everyone around ? What it is you think the rest of us should tolerate ? Come one I keep asking but none of you will answer that and I have money riding on your answer . Come on pal take a real stand . Or you can just call me names no matter . <p> " No that 's not what I am saying Alice . Open your mind a little . You are confusing so many issues .

According to this everything I have said is true I just should not take it too seriously . And for your info I never said no safe level you must be thinking about someone else . This is the exact thing CYZane the tobacco advocate said in her lesson on how to teach my grandchildren about nicotine addiction . <p> " Stick to the truth , tell them that smoking is not a healthy habit .

" <p> Smoking regulations should be rolled back to 1950 era . With the exception of businesses that do n't want to . nothing mandatory . Lung cancer occurrence now is 4X higher per capita than in 1950 , despite everybody smoking everywhere , all the time . I think a mixture is in order , and that would be what would happen no doubt . some places would allow it , other would not . caters to everybody . <p> I have to say Cy you have drawn a very fine line here .

" <p> Alice , may I remind you that I have revealed my true identity . Anything you say about me you have to prove it or it can and will be held against you . Noone is anonymous on the internet and do n't even think for a moment that I ca n't find out who you are . Others have tried it and ended up in court for libel . Now retract the " tobacco advocate " part immediately . As for the rest , I am done with you , speak to John 's hand . <p> And even if you weazle out of your inuendo , defending yourself that you do n't nessarily mean a " tobacco industry advocate " , it is still false . I am not advocating for or against tobacco . I am advocating for revealing the lies and shenanigans surrounding the tobacco issue and especially the second hand smoke fraud . Full period . <p> You have revealed your true identity ? Where was I ? Nope and I would happily tell you who I am and you could try to sue me . LOL Really because as I go back over the links and such you seem to be an advocate and yet you seem to have a soft spot in your tiny smoke filled heart for children . <p> In fact somewhere here there is a link to one of my youtube pages I am not hiding from anything and certainly not from you . <p> I am an advocate and I revealed exactly who I was and a link to the organization I represent . Now get your cognitive functions in tune , go back a few threads and you might find it . You might even find a few questions you conveniently avoided answering . After you have perused the websites of my organization and you have navigated the internet to learn more about me and what I do , prove that I am either a tobacco industry advocate or even a tobacco advocate or retract your inuendo . Like I said others have unsuccessfuly tried it , one organization had the quasi-decency to retract but not to apologize . http : **67;678;TOOLONG One ended up in court and finally decided to settle out of court admitting his wrongful ways . <p> Um I am pretty sure I could call you a delusional nicotine addict and suffer zero consequences for my opinion but if you need to sue me I would love that . My lawyers are free and we would love to film that negotiation too . What do you think . You in an office with annoying me and a bunch of annoying lawyers and no nicotine and knowing that I have free representation and that even if you won you ca n't get anything from me . That would be a laugh riot ! Let 's go ! <p> GnomeAlice on October 23 , 2011 at 7:29 pm <p> Not unlike the families who have lost their loved one to a drunk driver they do n't care is drunk think they can drive perfectly well when they have been drinking . They ca n't and you can not tell me what my own experience is and call me all the names you want I am a Grandmother and I have rights too . I am doing my job trying to protect my grandchildren and your opinion about that means zero to me It is just mean spirited and dysfunctional . I am going to make a documentary and the stuff you have said here will play a big part because I am shocked and the stuff you will say and do to protect yourself from the truth . The truth is I do not care if you are addicted I want you to stop being in my air space and I do n't care if you think you do n't stink or it does n't effect anyone negatively or that you think we are all brainwashed because you ca n't possibly see how much bull all of that is . Why do you treat our world like your own personal ashtray ? I am sure one of you does n't so that guy will now jump up and say he does n't so that makes it not true ? In the end you are all so wrong it is sad but anyway I am taking some comfort in the fact that you ca n't smoke outdoors in New York City I am sure that will help the rest of our cities ban your addiction and banish it to where it should be in the alleys hiding amongst the other crack heads . <p> You folks have radicalized me I was just going to make a simple little video about kids but now I see it needs to be about you and you arrogance . Once again I have to give you my deepest thanks . <p> GnomeAlice on October 24 , 2011 at 5:33 pm <p> Heres what I think CyZane I would be thrilled if you sued me Come at it . And I will not do anything like retract anything That is silly . You folks have made so many outrageous insults and misstatements about me that I thought reasonably it was a free for all and that is certainly the way any judge would see it if you ever got anywhere with that . Hilarious ! You never cease to cheer me up my dear . I thought you were splitting ? Well I will miss you but I see no point in oyu sticking around You have said all you want to and you are bored and hilarious ... did I mention hilarious ! ? Belly laughing all of us . You have neglected to answer the questions I asked but it has made no difference because we really got what we wanted from you anyway . I have thanked you and I will be sure to credit you in the film now that you have given me your identity . Lovely ! <p> We are thinking that this convo is just about done so we once again would like to thank everyone and we wish you all the best . I will try to figure out how to let you know when it is released so you can all rip it to pieces . They only bad press is no press as they say . Cheers . <p> Alice , You really must see a ' MENTAL HEALTH SPECIALIST ' . You are suffering -- I do not know what exactly you are suffering from , but you are suffering . Only a person who is suffering could possibly believe that the atmosphere is normally ' clean ' . It is not . It is filthy ! There are MOLD SPORES ( fungi ) inundating the atmosphere -- billions of them . There is POLLEN in unimaginable quantities . There is DUST . There are FUMES -- all in vast quantities . By comparison , tobacco smoke is minuscule . But you believe every word that Tobacco Control Zealots tell you . <p> And what is it that worries you ? Merely the fact that you can actually RECOGNISE what you believe to be tobacco smoke , whether it is or not . To you , every pong that you experience is tobacco smoke . <p> Because you do not like the pong which you think is tobacco smoke , you want the atmosphere , everywhere in the world , to be only contaminated by MOLD SPORES , and POLLEN , and DUST and FUMES , but not what YOU think is tobacco smoke . You want this JUST IN CASE you , personally , happen to turn up one day in Timbuktu . <p> Anti smoker reverend and sooth Sayer , Simon Chapman in a published study at the British Medical Journal , http : **45;747;TOOLONG reveals bragging rights the multitude of ways that smokers are being slandered in the promotion of smoking cessation products , that at the end of the day reduce significantly someone 's chances of quitting , if that is what they truly wish , or to force others by coercive means , to use them , regardless of their wishes . Both will fail to quit , in more than 96% of the cases that these so called medical treatments are prescribed . Only the reach of corruption , that invented the indefensibly exaggerated and irresponsible fears of second hand tobacco smoke , from within the medical communities , could we promote a snake oil product , to being named a " medical treatment " with such an abysmal production of failure , compared to using nothing at all . <p> RIP cigarettes by mandatory laws which were imposed upon smokers without harm assessments , discussions or debate emphasize the new reality of " no safe level of tobacco smoke " edicts , that only products which will increase health risks to millions of consumers , will be allowed to pass into law without opposition . Whereas all products which seek to decrease health risks , by physical , common sense and scientific means , such as flu cured tobacco , electronic cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products will face significant opposition from the medical community , except those special products , deemed " medical treatments " by financial conflicts of interest with the mandate of proof at the top of the list of detractors . Is Public health dedicated to maintaining the mortality and morbidity numbers as their ultimate influence over elected officials , in a similar multitude of ways that smokers have been promoted by bigoted stereotype , for their use of a legal product ? By back to front advertising schema and half truths by nondisclosure , we are eliminating the law which is clear , that decisions affecting personal health , are the sole domain of the individual and not within the realm of a busy body paternalist political regime . <p> No one , because they do n't smoke is forced to be included in a bigoted group , which demands bullying and hateful anti-smoker attitudes . In spite of what the Public health lobby has pronounced to be normal in their " health reform " perspectives . <p> I guess this continue to need to be clarified I am not part of any group and in fact I have never even research either side of the issue . You folks are the first people I have ever tried to talk to about it so your are blowing smoke there . I have always been a community activist and have been a non smoker for some time now . I am talking directly about what I personally experience in my own life . All the rest of the stuff you folks have brought has nothing to do with me I am not part of a movement . I am trying to protect the rights of myself and my own family because of our own personal experience with the drug nicotine and smoking And you can bluster on all day it is n't going to change that . I was given more information here about not smoking in fact than I have ever seen and about smoking but it does not change the fact that I am making a documentary about myself and my grandchildren and our experience . <p> Not unlike the families who have lost their loved one to a drunk driver they do n't care is drunk think they can drive perfectly well when they have been drinking . They ca n't and you can not tell me what my own experience is and call me all the names you want I am a Grandmother and I have rights too . I am doing my job trying to protect my grandchildren and your opinion about that means zero to me It is just mean spirited and dysfunctional . I am going to make a documentary and the stuff you have said here will play a big part because I am shocked and the stuff you will say and do to protect yourself from the truth . The truth is I do not care if you are addicted I want you to stop being in my air space and I do n't care if you think you do n't stink or it does n't effect anyone negatively or that you think we are all brainwashed because you ca n't possibly see how much bull all of that is . Why do you treat our world like your own personal ashtray ? I am sure one of you does n't so that guy will now jump up and say he does n't so that makes it not true ? In the end you are all so wrong it is sad but anyway I am taking some comfort in the fact that you ca n't smoke outdoors in New York City I am sure that will help the rest of our cities ban your addiction and banish it to where it should be in the alleys hiding amongst the other crack heads . <p> You folks have radicalized me I was just going to make a simple little video about kids but now I see it needs to be about you and you arrogance . Once again I have to give you my deepest thanks . <p> Alice , dear ! There you go again ! You say nicotine is a drug . Please tell me what is not . We used to have a reasonable idea of what we mean by the word ' drug ' , depending upon the circumstances of the use of the word . For example , ' drugs companies ' manufactured ' good ' drugs , while ' druggies ' took ' bad ' drugs . ' Good ' drugs were asprin etc , ' bad ' drugs were heroin etc . But you are now trying to convert ordinary substances into ' drugs ' -- like sugar , tea , coffee , water , nicotine , air , beer , fat , cola and so forth . <p> You have NOT been giving a history of your life at all . You have been spewing out propaganda and lies , just like the quack professors , quack doctors and quack politicians . QUACK ! QUACK ! QUACK ! <p> We thought of one more question . And this one is from one of the kids . How does any of you explain or justify or rationalize , sorry we are trying to figure out what the kid said .... how do any of you think of the cigarette smokers who " use the street for an ashtray . " ? This is important to all of us because we have listened to all of the arguments which we are assessing yet we ca n't believe that it is ok with any of you that so many of you toss their butts everywhere . It is also a very reasonable question . <p> Why do cigarette ends appear MORE OFTEN on the ground ? Because people have been FORCED to smoke on the streets BY THE GOVERNMENT . <p> There is also another matter . Filter tips used to be made of paper . The Government FORCED tobacco manufacturers to use cellulose because it absorbs more tar . Cellulose does not rot as quickly as paper , therefore THE GOVERNMENT have caused the problem . <p> But IS there a problem ? What is the problem ? Filter tips are not poisonous or anything . What is the problem ? Just sweep them up like tree leaves ! They are harmless . <p> UNBELIEVABLE ! I am so happy you are saying these things . Such blatantly blind circular logic . Again I have to thank you all for you candid responses . Awesome Every time we ask you a question your answers are so un thought out and unreal and narrow . Hilarious ! and very sad . You really believe what you just said and I know you do to and if I disagreed with you will become more and more CERTAIN that you are right . Awesome ! Such amazing responses I never really expected that we would get so much great writing from smokers and such amazing research ! Could n't pay to get this stuff ! Thank you so much . <p> Alice , What questions did you ask the ' kids ' in order to bring their attention to something that no ' kid ' would ever notice ? -- Filter tips in the street . No ' kid ' that I have ever known ever notices such things -- it is not in their nature , They notice only those things which are interesting to them -- such as bikes , ice-cream vans , mice , dogs , cats , friends , mothers , dads , policemen , balls , bats , trees to climb , and so on . When did your ' kids ' become weird ? <p> Well you wo n't believe it so not much point in telling but I asked her what the most difficult problems she has going to and from school and other places ? She could have said the smoke or cars or an number of things but she heard David Suzuki say that the birds feather their nest with the filters and the chemicals soften the egg shells and the birds ca n't survive . And her friend said that they had a report on the oceans and lakes that they were studying in geography and they had to make a pollution drama and she had made on showing that the oceans are over burdened but filters and the toxins that come with them , You asked . Do n't brother blustering about it because everyone here already know what you are going to say so yawn keep it please . No one here expects you to care one way or the other and insulting us is irrelevant . It just shows that nicotine addicts ca n't handle and descent . <p> You folks are so addicted it is taking away your ability to think , I have all we need and of course we do n't agree but that 's ok You are only four or five addicts The many that I know are suffering their lung hurt and they do n't feel good and they complain about how they feel all the time and they are n't lying or making it up . They want to stop being a slave to any chemical . You are happy with your choices great for you however ridiclous you are to me you are incapable of seeing or hearing the reality which is very obvious You move from one subject to another and you are saying insanely wrong things . <p> You sound EXACTLY like all other addicts . I do not take advice from addicts nor am i concerned about what they think of me . I a grand mom and caring community member have been treated badly and told lies to justify your addiction and your abuse and your environmental irresponsibility and I have said before and I will say it again You have made our job much easier and we appreciate it but I have been both a smoker and a non smoker and I know that until I was free I would fight tooth and nail and lie to myself that it was ok and no I do n't Get treatment ! <p> Try it on the other side for a while and see how it goes . Maybe your brains will function better . It is fear and chemicals that are making you a very bad citizen . That last thing about the butts is just about the most ignorant thing I have ever heard and I do n't see this conversation going anywhere but into the toilet with your judgement and mental ability . I hope you fools do not live near me . <p> More smokers than those commenting have watched this extraordinary ' conversation ' unfold ( and admiring our colleagues ' tremendous doggedness and wit ) . All the energy and effort you have expended on trying to save us from ourselves might have been more usefully deployed on the streets of your ' community ' where you could be actively trying to bring enlightenment to all the smokers blighting your immediate environment . After all , they 'll be stuffed full of nicotine as long as they 're smoking , so they 'll not be inclined towards rage or violence . You could take your grandkids along to show the evil addicts what innocent young bodies they are intent on corrupting . You would n't just want to be considered an armchair activist , would you ? And keeping your special insights to yourself is just selfish . <p> I have spent zero time trying to save you at all I was trying and accomplished research into the responses I would get from a conversation about the issues for a documentary I am making about the people around me who are struggling with the issues especially children . <p> I appreciate each and every comment you have made and as I have mentioned we will continue to collect these poignant and thoughtful remarks you have been contributing . <p> As to my selfishness I am not sure we have met . I do know what the people around me thing of me and I will probably stay with that because they actually know me . <p> As I have said every day , thank you all so much for your contribution to our research . We are assessing all of the links and information you have so freely and generously provided for us and the considered and reasonable arguments you have taken the time and trouble to contribute . <p> There is a story about PT Barnum I would love to share with you if you have the time . <p> When PT first brought his " emerging circus " to the US he was I believe in New York with many wondrous things to see . He had set up in a really large space but the show was so popular it became very crowded and the people did not move through the Emporium very quickly so they became too close together and some could n't get in . PT Decided to put up a sign at the back doors that said " This Way to the Egress " As very few people knew that the word means exit they all ran to the doors and went out . <p> I told this story because you mentioned selfishness . And I have mentioned ignorance . <p> I do think it is interesting that you have advised me to do what it is I am already doing . I hope CyZane and John do n't catch you at the because I do n't think that is what they would say was what I should do ! <p> GnomeAlice on October 25 , 2011 at 9:34 am <p> It is such a pity to hear of children being propagandised -- such a pity . Of course , once they get into their teens and realise that they have been lied to all these years , they will kick over the traces and rebel . They will become smokers and drinkers . Is n't human nature awful ? But are you sure that they are being told that the oceans are awash with filter tips ? I mean ... really ? The thing is that the oceans are so vast that , in volume terms , all the filter tips ever made would not be noticeable in the oceans . In any case , microbes in the oceans feed off such stuff as cellulose and the tar within filter tips . ( The tar is just another form of oil -- you know , the stuff that the Florida oil spill pumped into the sea and which was cleared away in no time by microbes ) If I was you , I would ensure that you rid their minds of this nonsense . As regards your ' research ' , I have never heard of ' research by diatribe ' before . How does it work ? Do you just yell out insults , nonsense and falsities and see what reaction you get ? Well ... I suppose that 's one way to do research . And there you go again -- bawling out ADDICTION ! ADDICTION ! ADDICTION ! DRUGS ! DRUGS ! DRUGS ! I did n't think that I was actually addicted to tea , but I suppose that I must be . Do you know that properly ' cured ' tobacco smells just like tea bags ? Actually , tobacco leaves and tea leaves are almost exactly the same thing ! So I would not let your grandchildren drink tea -- think of all the harmful chemicals , thousands of them . Oh , the same goes for coffee . Addicted to tea and coffee and destined for a premature horribly painful death . Alice , you keep saying that you are going away , but you do n't . Why is that ? <p> How is it that you all seem to think that just because there are other issues in the world that I should not have this one as my concern . So strange that no matter what I say or how I say it you all seem so threatened by even the tiniest light of any kind being shed upon your habit of smoking tobacco ? Did you notice that you ca n't hear anything without either misdirecting the thoughts away from nicotine or attacking the messenger ? Were you under the impression that I was asking your opinion about what work I may do or what ideas I might hold or what I may say ? <p> None of you has single thing to say that has dissuaded me in even the slightest and I would think that would be obvious . I think that if we were talking about land use or what to have for supper you would be able to have an adult reasonable conversation but because we are talking about something you are addicted to and that most of you know you are wrong about that you are aggressive and unreasonable but then that is just my opinion which in Canada so far I am entitled to . <p> Me thinks thou doth protest too much ! May hap you need to be more honest than aggresive . <p> I know you folks will just say that all of the people who say this stuff just like the sound of their own voice or the are in league with whatever anti tobacco conspiracy and I am not seeking an answer but just so you can see that I am not the only person who thinks there just could be a problem . <p> http : //www.cigwaste.org/ The above are all only a very few articles about the butts polluting your world . Now I know that none of you will believe any so no need to splutter on about that either just giving you an opportunity to see where we are looking besides to a bunch of addicts for our information . <p> The following is just a smattering of folks that none of you will read or agree with nut no matter you are certain to remain deluded because you are an addict and you can only choose between being addict or treatment . <p> http : **42;794;TOOLONG I find this one helpful because they DO NOT ADVOCATE USING NICOTINE REPLACEMENT so that shoots all you drug company accusers arguments out of the water because at the very least these people are just trying to be free and that is how I got free too I just stopped because I did n't need it and it cost too much irritated my children ears eyes and noses and made everything stink . Three very good reasons to stop doing something that is even just for those problems . <p> There are hundreds of places for people to get help to stop smoking . You say that all of those people are deluded and working for special interests such as the pharmaceutical companies . In fact a few of you have denied my own experience and said that I am working for CTV and for big Pharm and deluded by PSA 's . Okay Doaky says I that sure does make sense . And all of those organization such as the World Helath Organization and the local people begging governments for relief from the horrible smell and the toxic smoke are all either liers or stupid sheep but smoking is unquestionably the right " choice " to make ! Fair enough . No problem with you if I allow myself to decide for me and my Grandchildren whose information is more credible for us . <p> None of you realize that you are hostile and arrogant and misinformed and misdirecting and addicted BECAUSE IF ADDICTS ADMIT THEY ARE ADDICTED AND THAT IT IS EFFECTING OTHER NEGATIVELY ESPECIALLY THEIR FAMILIES THEY WILL HAVE TO CHANGE AND THEY DO N'T WANT TO ! THAT IS ADDICTION ! You can not point at me and say that there is any reason other than my own personal experience and say the same thing . <p> Anyway be clear I am not in any way trying to make oyu do anything I wish you the best and I hope for you that you are one day able to get past the shame and guilt and see what you are doing and stop it but I do n't care if you do and you should not care what I do to protect my family and the rights of children around me who have no voice . I am in side a large group of lovely little people and no matter how much you struggle against it they are aware and they do not approve and you are intentionally ( well because of your addiction so really not intentionally ) injuring and disrespecting the children of our planet . That shame is yours . Every time you emerge from your addicted cloud of toxic waste you know in your own heart that what you are doing is socially unacceptable and deadly and that if you could really choose you would not do it for each and every reason I have outlined here . <p> All addict feel that they are weak or that they have a special perspective . All addicts deny they are addicted and deny that they are doing anything negative to anyone else . All addicts deny the truth and can not tell the truth as well . All addicts misdirect and distract themselves from reality to save their brain fro hearing the truth . I would suggest that most of you have been in this argument before and that is why you have such an enormous hate on for anything vaguely anti nicotine and that means your spouse or your kids have suggested that you need to quit and you have created this mystical reason that you know different and I am pretty sure at least some of you have had deep family wounds caused over the issues and the ones of oyu who are honest are near tears if they read this because I know who you all are . Most of you have hurt at least one loved ones feelings to protect your addiction and I would say most of the real hard core ones live alone and know why . I know for a fact each and every one of you know you have reacted really badly to something that was not really anything because you could n't get a hit fast enough and oyu are embarrassed about it . I would think that if you are a normal addict this can happen several times a day until everyone around you thinks you have a hair trigger and some of you go around blustering and snorting every time anyone says they do n't want to be in a room with either a nic addict or smoking . <p> Most of us know if we are working with nicotine addicts they have to stop everything and go outside or they will have a melt down so that stops everyone 's work or makes the nic addict fall behind . This plays out in schools and offices and workplaces everywhere . One of the partners in our company works in the film industry and there are many addicts who have to stop filing or working or whatever they are doing and go outside and smoke or they will begin to simmer and rage and complain . When I went to school it was the same way that is why you can deny my own experience all you like I was one of those nic addicts demanding to get out and that other people whit for me and I have also been a non smoker being harassed and distracted by a nic addict who needed his smoke . <p> And yes of course I like the sound of my own voice is that some kind of insult ? I am inspired to save the children in my neighborhood and to defend them and to help them have a voice and you folks have provided me with tons of information so I am excited and enthusiastic why should n't I be ? But then you ca n't see that I am a good citizen because your house of cards will fall down so you have to attack me and belittle me which is fine that is a nic addict thing I would n't understand . LMAO ! <p> " " The major component in the rigid cell walls in plants is cellulose . " " ( Wikipedia ) <p> Cellulose is plant material . So why are you so afraid of filter tips ? ( Oh .... by the way .... your use of the word ' butt ' in respect of cigarette ends is incorrect , unless you mean cigarettes without filters . A ' cigarette butt ' is the remaining bit which is discarded but which is tobacco , and not plant material ) . <p> Humans and animals do not directly have the ability to digest cellulose ( so it would be as well not to eat filter tips , even though they would do you no harm since they are just the same thing as fibre in your diet ( highly recommended by dietitians ) ) . Cows etc , however , have bacteria in their gut which can break down cellulose , Lots of the same sort of bacteria inhabit the sea and lakes etc . They gobble up this plant material called cellulose . Perhaps you might like to research that subject -- but not by screaming abuse -- books do not respond to abuse . <p> I have read lots of stuff like the sites you quote . QUACK ! QUACK ! Simple propaganda . <p> Wow what a trip ! You guys do seem to be kinda mean . I guess you know that there are lots of non smokers who do n't agree with any of what you are saying . And Gnome you seem to be the only one ehre trying to speak for non smokers . What 's the deal ? Why do you care what these people do or do n't do ? <p> These folks are hard core addicts and defenders of the .... hmmm I am not sure what but anyway they are just some test subjects we are researching reactions to certain questions about public tobacco use and kids rights . These guys are very helpful . And I think they are aware that they are helping us but they do n't seem to be able to stop themselves from giving us the evidence and research we need even though they seem very distressed that we are going to make it . They seem quite defensive and threatened but we expected that . We feel really inspired though because they are so pitifully addicted that we are hopeful that even these conversations may help someone to rethink their position . Anyway maybe we can help the kids have a voice . Thanks for asking it has been a bit lonely here . But we are getting lots of great responses . <p> Why do n't you look after your own kids and grand kids and leave other people to look after their own ? What force are you intending to use in order to impose your own ideas ? Do you have the funds to take ever child into care ? Will you have monitors in every home along with closed circuit TV ? Sounds like 1984 to me . " Big Brother is watching YOU ! ! ! " <p> Jeeze given those questions I guess you would think that crack heads are smoking every where today and they are n't . Why is that do you think ? Is it because they are addicted to a drug that is dangerous and stinks ? Because that is the direction I would be happy to see tobacco go . It should be as legal as crack and it should have the same exact rights involved too . There is no difference today other than the legality . All addicts should be treated the equally . And I do take care of my life and I am responsible Have you never heard of people who love their planet and their community and work toward a better life ? Geeze do you challenge every body who is trying to help others this way or just those who do n't agree with you ? So you are saying that now I have no right to make a better world for children ? Who are you ? <p> I am not asking you what rights you have . As far as I know , you personally have no rights over other people 's children . But it would be nice to know why it is that you want to make other people 's children 's lives miserable . You say you want to make a better world for childeren . It sounds to me as though you want to make ' better ' children for the world -- other people 's children , needless to say . <p> Junican on October 26 , 2011 at 2:57 pm <p> The reason that she is alone is that she is the only manic anti-smoking zealot in town . Her ignorance is beyond parody . For example , what harm have children ever come to as a result of living with smoking parents ? There is no evidence of such . On the contrary , kids who are exposed to environmental tobacco smoke have been found to suffer far less asthma.FAR LESS ! ! <p> See what I am sayin ' ? The place is a research mecca for die hards . They have said some awesome stuff like that and they really believe it ! ! ! ! Could n't find that anywhere and they do n't seem to be able to stop them selves from contributing but that is the addict part . They are making the case for us . Amazing . <p> And here is another piece of information for you , my dear Gnomeskull . During the last several decades , smoking prevalence has been falling and falling . At the same time , the incidence of asthma cases has been growing and growing . I am not claiming ' cause and effect ' -- just mentioning the FACTS . Perhaps your cronies in Tobacco Control did not tell you about that ? So tell me again what evidence you have that children have ever suffered in any significant way as a result of environmental tobacco smoke ? ( Do not count children who already have some sort of chronic illness -- that would be cheating ) And here is another interesting question for you . I am addicted to tea . Please tell me what is wrong with being AN ADDICT in respect of tea . Tell me , precisely , what is wrong with being AN ADDICT . <p> You ca n't expect a little thing like evidence and facts to penetrate the skull of someone who thinks smokers are just like crack addicts , only smellier . As you said , ' beyond parody ' . If it were n't for the erratic spelling and lack of punctuation , I would think GnomeAlice is a bot . <p> I 'm still waiting for a report back on Gnome 's efforts at reforming smokers on the street by telling them they 're delusional crack addicts who are killing baby birds and poisoning the seas . <p> Not trying to reform smokers . You are making a stuff up to delude yourself that someone is trying to control you . I am trying to control my life and my environment . You are fine to be as addicted or not addicted or smoke or do n't I do n't care at all nor do I care what you think of what I am doing . More sillyness and misdirection . Why are you so threatened ? <p> OK guys the concept is that I am an indy film maker who is making a documentary about her own experience with tobacco and nicotine addiction . And there are lots of addicts no one said there is anything wrong with them I said they have caused and do cause myself and my family many problems and I am interested in exploring that in film I find it funny that you keep hiring me as a conspirator in some anti smoking campaign . I have said over and over I do n't care if you smoke . I care if you smoke and it creates a problem for me that myself or my kids or my community defines as a problem for us personally . I want to ask you why you think it is you all keep making up stuff that I am supposed to be ? You need me to be conspiring and to be against you smoking . But I am not I am against you smoking anywhere I go . You can say anything you like I have as much right to be against that as you do to think what you like . <p> I am so tired of heaing that people who smoke are weak , selfish , evil etc , come on people we could be doing things that are horrible , get over it , its a persons right to do what ever they please , having a smoke does not make someone a bad person , and i dare one person who complains and whines to say they have never had a drink , i see others put down someone who smokes while they themselves are relaxing with a beer , its laughable.I also get very angry that it is banned most places , i do beleive in this ban to protect others and have no problem with it but i do not like it that there is no such ban or people who insist on wearing obnoxiuos perfumes or colognes that many others are allergic to , when will that come into place ? It is much needed and long overdue ! <p> Who cares if mommy sometimes sneaks a smoke or two . Parenting is hard ! Never judge someone until you walk in their shoes .. Atleast we are not doing it around the kids and exposing them . Sneaking a few cigs a week is not the same as smoking two packs a day , people just need to calm down these days . I think pressure to be a perfect mom ( from perfect schools , organic foods , did I breast feed long enough , am I constantly educating my child and playing enough , are they involved in enough activities , too many activities , global warming , jeez ) I want to smoke just writing the list , but I will wait until my girls go to bed . I am about to feed them an organic lunch , and have craft time ! <p> Lmao ... I 'm on here looking for ideas as to wht on earth I 'm going to do when my baby gets here ; I 've done my best to cut down while pregnant but it 's just so hard to completely give up.I do n't want to be tht evil person smoking around my child so it 's like wht to do ? I mean if I want to go outside &amp; sit under the trees is it ok to smoke downwind from the baby ? or wht if I want to go for a really long walk ? idk of course I do n't smoke in my home &amp; everything is defumegated for the baby but summer is coming &amp; I 'll want to do outdoorsy stuff <p> Notice : Your email may not yet have been verified .

@@4371238 <p> After three days of bonding and brotherhood in Trenton the Maple Leafs begin a stretch of five games in eight nights on Saturday when the Calgary Flames visit the Air Canada Centre . After the Flames depart , the Leafs play four games in one calendar week .

His speed is the kind that should serve as a good test for the Leafs defencemen on Monday night . Colorado first-rounder Gabriel Landeskog should be a Calder Trophy candidate , and if Colorado coach Joe Sacco has a sense of the dramatic , he will start backup goalie Jean-Sebastien Giguere . Think Leafs defenceman John-Michael Liles would n't mind showing up his former team ? It 's the only time Liles , traded to Toronto by the Avs in June , will face his old club this season . <p> 3 .

On March 13 , 1996 , the teams fought to a 3-3 tie at Maple Leaf Gardens . <p> 4 . Any chance Tyler Seguin flashes his Stanley Cup ring at Phil Kessel on Thursday night in Beantown ? Doubtful , but no matter how the individual careers unfold for the two , Seguin always will have the ring to fall back on . Kessel ? Not sure about that yet . Still , the Kessel-Seguin angle will be one that lives on for years .

@@4373230 <p> Having paid Steve Jobs the full measure of our devotion , let us now argue about how to create the next Steve Jobs . Which choices can governments and educators make that will encourage the next miraculous hybrid of gearhead , design genius , marketing whiz and change catalyst ? <p> It 's fair to answer , " Give up . It 's impossible . " The rise of Jobs 1.0 looks more like a happy accident than anything else . He dropped out of a liberal-arts college in Portland and then stuck around to audit the calligraphy course . And yet I 'm pretty sure that if everyone in Canada were required to take calligraphy without credit , it would n't spark a new renaissance . To be fair , probably people would send more and nicer thank-you notes . <p> But still . It 's worth spending a little time to ask what was germane and broadly applicable in Jobs 's life . After all , no matter what governments do , it wo n't be long before they 're claiming to be producing a new generation of Jobses . <p> Governments are trying all the time to encourage innovation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panel on the subject will release its report on how to improve federal support to business R&amp;D . Some good may even come out of that process . This panel has a tech entrepreneur from Waterloo , Tom Jenkins , and a university president , David Naylor , on it . <p> You 'd have to be a real cynic to point out that it 's only been five years since the last government-appointed expert panel released the last report on business innovation . Or that that panel also starred a rich Waterloo gearhead , Mike Lazaridis , and a university president , Indira Samarasekera . So right there , you see how a crazy dream can change the world . <p> But never mind the nuts and bolts of federal policy . ( You can thank me later . ) Asking how a Steve Jobs could rise where he did , when he did , is just another way of asking what matters in the development of human potential . That 's always useful . What makes it fun is that Jobs 's own remarks on education appear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of teachers ' unions . " The unions are the worst thing that ever happened to education because it 's not a meritocracy , " he said in 1995 . " It turns into a bureaucracy , which is exactly what has happened . The teachers ca n't teach , and administrators run the place , and nobody can be fired . It 's terrible . " <p> He also believed in wide-open choice in education . In the same 1995 interview he said , " I believe very strongly that if the country gave each parent a voucher for $4,400 " -- the cost of a year 's public education in California -- " that they could only spend at any accredited school , several things would happen . Number one , schools would start marketing themselves like crazy to get students . Secondly , I think you 'd see a lot of new schools starting . " Third , " Some of the schools would go broke .

I 'm not even sure I believe that would be the right path , but it 's only fair to give Jobs a vote . In Canada these are seen as pretty right-wing ideas . But other elements of his story are so redolent of California in the 1970s they practically reek of patchouli . He once said his lifelong rival Bill Gates would be " a broader guy if he had dropped acid once or gone off to an ashram when he was younger . " ( In Gates 's defence , his late-career emergence as a philanthropist rivals anything any other tech pioneer has done on the " broadness " front . ) <p> When he unveiled the first iPad , Jobs said : " It 's in Apple 's DNA that technology alone is not enough . It 's technology married with liberal arts , married with the humanities , that yields us the result that makes our heart sing . " It was a direct rebuttal to Gates 's belief that schools should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Jobs believed , rightly , that nobody can know anymore at 20 which field will " produce jobs " when he 's 40 , so it 's better to just try to become a good person , in the way Aristotle would have understood that term . <p> It took barely 48 hours after Jobs died for his 2005 Stanford University commencement address ( " Stay hungry . Stay foolish . " ) to become the ur-text for anyone seeking the Meaning of Jobs . That speech was about the merits of failure . Jobs said the hardest trials of his life were also the most fruitful : his decision to drop out of college , the putsch that kicked him out of Apple in 1985 , and his cancer diagnosis . Each time , living life by rote simply became impossible . He was thrown back on his own resources . It really hurt . <p> Here , I think , is where the Jobs who lived a random life and the Jobs who wanted to bust the teachers ' unions find common ground : he believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He supported meritocracy and opposed central planning . So one way to honour his best example would be for governments to refrain from doing what comes naturally : to tell everybody what they should learn and do , and to try to shield everyone from a cloudy day . <h> Advertisement <h> Post navigation <h> Freedom to fail is what made Steve Jobs <p> Human potential ? There is a surfeit of human potential left unused in an alarming number of cities and countries across the planet . Really , the waste of human capital* is truly staggering . We should not be waiting , baited breath , for the next Steve Jobs to grace us . No , we should be wondering why he even ( was allowed to ? ) happened at all . Not only do you need genius . You need genius that is approved as worthy . Oh , and that money can be made off of is certainly very helpful as well . <p> *Human potential is just that , potential , as in : could possibly be . Human capital is developed potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> PS : that Steve Jobs disproved of central planning , merely means that he had no talent/genius for it . His genius found it 's best venue for expression as a CEO , where it must be said he held the reigns to make a tyrant blush . <p> Governments are trying all the time to encourage innovation and productivity . But they wo n't just get out of the way . <p> So one way to honour his best example would be for governments to refrain from doing what comes naturally : to tell everybody what they should learn and do , and to try to shield everyone from a cloudy day . Amen ! Anybody dare put odds on that happening ? <p> There is a fundamental flaw in everyone that pops out of the woodwork and takes an opportunity to bash to Govt , and asks for the Govt. to stand back .

If you are focused on getting people to give you way and stand back- you are incapable of jumping the gap i.e. innovating . There is nothing gained from anyone standing back . <p> The problem , I think , is that the kind of public policy that might produce more Steve Jobses might do a worse job of producing Joe Lunchbucket . For innovation to work , you do n't just need somebody with an idea , you need a workforce capable of producing the product ( and good infrastructure/a good business climate ) . <p> What is more , Canada does n't need to have its own innovators . Ideas are public goods -- anybody can snap them up ( Jobs was quite adept at doing so too -- if you look at what he took from Xerox ) . Look at RIM as a case in point , yes , for a few years RIM earned extra-high profits from being a first-mover . But it did n't take long for copycats to enter the market , rendering the Blackberry an also-ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , Bombardier invented the snowmobile , but it is the company 's involvement in rail and regional jets that produces the vast majority of revenues and jobs . <p> The better strategy for a country that makes up a tiny portion of global population or GDP , is to have a public policy capable of producing skilled median workers , good infrastructure , and a favourable business climate . Our enduring firms have not been great innovators , but rather refiners of existing products in industries where Canada has inherent advantages . <p> I 've been over this several times and still do n't understand where you 're going with it . <p> If you want us to take ideas and innovations from other countries and have a lot of Joe Lunchpails manufacturing them ..... that would make us part of the Chinese factory system ... and really , China has that covered .... which is why we have large numbers of unemployed Joe Lunchpails . <p> I think Jobs is excellent at his own ideas and innovations for how to make customers buy the products voluntarily . China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of plenty innovation and outstanding ideas . <p> I 'm learning about physics right now , and one of the really interesting things I 'm learning is that Einstein was wrong . Not wrong all the time , of course , but I 'm just amazed he was wrong on anything . So not only can you not tell which " smart person " is going to be a successful smart person -- even if they are successful at being the innovator and all that , you still ca n't tell when to listen and when the idea is wrong . <p> " " I believe very strongly that if the country gave each parent a voucher for $4,400 " -- the cost of a year 's public education in California -- " that they could only spend at any accredited school , several things would happen .

Schools get funding based on a combination of # of students and provincial exam results , and the schools have open borders ( i.e. you do n't have to live in the neighborhood/cachement area to attend any particular school ) . There are a number of language-immersion schools ( French , German , Ukrainian come to mind , there are likely others ) , liberal arts , computer science , military/cadets , sports ( some with a soccer focus , or hockey or whatever ) and students &amp; their parents choose which school suits their particular needs . It 's not radical or right-wing . It works . <p> And yet we have the highest rate of kids leaving high-school incomplete in the country . Knowing now that Edmonton schools get funding based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection . I wonder how many expulsions there are shortly before exams ? <p> This is n't what Candace claims , however . And I know that the school-board in Calgary is different from the rest of the province and operates differently from it .

Until a couple of months earlier , she had played with me and a few other children almost every week , while her mother and mine , long-time close friends , exchanged visits . We , the younger kids , loved this pretty and happy playmate , who was always ready to lend us her toys . I had never seen her cry before , which made me believe that kids did n't cry when they reached her age . <p> The reason for Afshan 's crying was not her reluctance to marry the fourteen-year-old neighbor boy whose family together with hers had negotiated the match . She would n't think of disobeying her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciate the enormity of the step that was being taken for her .

Her mother was trying to pry the cat out of her embrace in preparation for the marriage ritual . " You can come back home every day , dear , and visit the cat , " she kept saying . The groom 's household , which would be Afshan 's home at dusk this day , did not allow pet cats . They were a nuisance , the groom 's father had said , and they interfered with the clean setting required for his daily prayers . This was an extreme view ; many very religious people , including Afshan 's parents , had no problems with cats so long as they were trained and did n't shed too much hair .

The miniature adult , too , seemed delighted for a while ; she was playing dress-up in a big way . But things started to change soon . Her socialization time with the kids was curtailed while her home tutoring for adulthood was given priority . At first , we missed her terribly at our games . Then we started to get used to the idea . When the news of her engagement and imminent wedding came , it was n't so much a shock as a relief to us : we were healed by what would decades later be rediscovered as a best-selling goal of therapy and termed " closure " thereafter . <p> Now I was transfixed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bride , an adult by definition , was acting like a child .

The latter was by far the larger of the two . A wedding party in the urban part of Tabriz had almost always been primarily a women 's affair . On this day , my father was among ten or fifteen close friends of the family who were attending the subdued male reception , which had started earlier than the women 's and would end long before most of the women arrived .

I was watching Afshan who now looked more like a decorated doll than her old little self . Her dress was beautiful and her heavily made-up face was tear-free . She was wearing a crown made of fine artificial flowers , illuminated by numerous tiny colored light bulbs . She had been duly coached : she knew that the clergyman 's loud and clear question coming from the other side of the curtain should be ignored twice . Thus after the third prompting she consented to the marriage proposal , uttering a barely audible " yes " with rehearsed adult dignity . Three " innocent " boys , including me , were given three rings to place on her fingers , in the order dictated by the proximity of each boy 's parents to the wedding families . <p> I missed the ritual at the men 's quarters , but I concluded from what Mother told me that it was quite boring . It was dominated by the signing of the necessary sacred documents . Nobody put a ring on the groom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later during similar events , the groom just sat there , nervously watched the older and wiser men , and spoke only when spoken to . He was not to see the bride until late that night , after she had been delivered to his home and after the wedding celebrations in the new home had come to an end . A family would have had to be more " modern " to allow the guests , the female guests only of course , a glimpse of the bride and groom together . <p> Very few of the guests at this party were that modern , although most of them would opine , in private , that wedding nine-year-olds to fourteen-year-olds was overdoing it a bit . The Governments minimum age was unrealistic , they were sure , but it would n't hurt to wait three or four more years . <p> As soon as the men left the house , it was time for music and dancing . At almost all the weddings I had attended with my mother before , professional female musicians were the main attraction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their households , looked the other way on a wedding occasion , and let their women have their way . The master of this household , however , being more religious than most , even on this rare occasion would only allow one approved instrument , called tabla gaval . The second word stood for a very common , tambourine-like , instrument . The first , the adjective , indicated the modification necessary to make it permissible : no jingling bells around it to make its possession and use sinful . " A gaval with all its teeth pulled out , " a woman whispered to another when it became clear that all the wedding party was going to get was two amateurs playing tabla gavals . The young women present had not expected professional musicians , considered evil by Afshan 's father . But they had hoped for real gavals played by skilled guests . Skilled players of real gavals would n't touch the primitive , toothless instrument . <p> Now that the house was the women 's and kids ' alone , a torrent of female guests was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and finest jewelry they owned or could make , buy , or borrow for the occasion , revealed only after they were safely inside the house . To avoid the sin of exposing their natural and artificial beauty to the strange men in the street , almost all of them were , until they stepped inside , covered by modest overalls and real or improvised , in some cases ridiculous-looking , hats . <p> The preferred outerwear for most of the female guests was of course not the long and loose coat they were wearing , but a charshub , a head-to-toe black shroud which would leave only their eyes and part of their faces uncovered . But there was a big problem with this : five or six years earlier , Reza Shah , the ruling monarch of Iran , had decided to extend his modernization programs from the male to the female population of the country . The initial methods of persuasion and benign coercion had not worked . The Shah would now emancipate the women of Iran , for their own good , at any cost . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reluctant to modernize , and tear their charshubs and head-scarves into pieces on the spot . These men , to whom my pious neighbors referred , in private , as " agents of corruption " or " immorality police " went easy on the scarves in wintertime , but would not otherwise tolerate anything but a hat . Completely bare hair , an alternative unthinkable to the faithful , was of course permitted by the police . <p> There were occasional well-dressed women in agreement with the new dress codes whom I saw in some Tabriz streets , wearing fitting coats and fashionable Frangi hats or an exposed hairdo . Orthodox men diverted their eyes when they met a willingly modern woman , said a short prayer , and sometimes uttered a mild , almost inaudible , curse to Satan . The women of orthodox men simply stayed home unless it was absolutely necessary to venture out , mainly to run to the neighborhood public bath-house once a week . Those few who could afford it , had a little bath-house built in their homes , a major feat for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ours , constructed a bath-house spacious and comfortable enough to accommodate not only his large family , but also the desperate neighbor women whenever the dreaded emancipation cops patrolling our streets were reported to be especially vicious . <p> The pious women hid their charshubs in their closets and saved them . They were certain that , some day , they would be able to use the garments again . This was only a minor inconvenience , they believed , a device of the Almighty to test the strength of their faith . The old Shah 's tyranny would come to an end , they said , God willing , and the forces of decency would once again prevail . <p> But the overwhelming majority of women did not want to stay home . They started to use various , sometimes ingenious , tricks to protect their modesty and honor . A common solution , one that we had resorted to on this wedding day , for example , was bribing the immorality police . My grown-up brother accompanied my mother and me to the bride 's house and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mother keep her scarf on account of a bad cold . The young cop , after making sure that no superior was watching him from a distance , gracefully accepted a little " tea money " offered in appreciation of the understanding that he was about to show . . . . <p> The prayers by the faithful , who had anxiously waited so long to get those charshubs out of their closets and feel free and dignified again , were answered in a curious way . Tabriz was occupied by the Russians ( and the whole country by one or other of the Allies in World War Two ) . The Shah , so bent on emancipation , was forced to abdicate his throne and leave the country . The new Shah was still too young and the new government too weak and too preoccupied with problems like food shortages to promote either morality or immorality . The day after the occupation , Saria Khanum , my best friend 's grandmother and the most pious old woman in my neighborhood , put on her very special charshub and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to visit like-minded friends . What made Saria Khanum 's charshub special was the added " pitcha " which was despised even by my religious mother and considered a relic of the past century . This was a rectangular black screen , made of goat hair , for her to see through ; no strange man , or woman for that matter , could see any part of her face through it . Saria Khanum immensely enjoyed her recaptured sense of freedom after six years of voluntary house arrest , and wondered why not all the women were celebrating . " May God grant the new Shah a long life she prayed . The godly young Shah had , according to her , " learned from the terrible fate of his evil father and decided to choose the right path -- God be praised a hundred thousand times . " <p> I would never see Afshan 's full face again . World War Two and the occupation ended . Through this and many ensuing social upheavals , Afshan observed the strict rules and regulations of her new , exceedingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did not allow the pretty bride out of the house , except for escorted visits to the bath-house and regular monthly visits to her parents living practically next door . His strict rules remained in force even after the immorality police were long gone . " The evil influences are always out there , " he said when Afshan 's mother pleaded with him to consider a parole for Afshan to attend the wedding of a former female playmate . The master and his son the groom , too , dug out their old traditional garments and hats , now that the Western dress codes , compulsory under the old Shah 's rule , had become optional . Every weekday , the two of them came home directly as soon as they closed the doors of their stationery store in the bazaar , " a prosperous business by the grace of God . " The son quit school after eighth grade by the master 's order and concentrated on his role as a partner and heir apparent . They entertained only a small , prescreened set of friends and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century after Afshan was so abruptly and prematurely catapulted to the adult world , and thirteen years after the most recent revolution in Iran , I visited my relatives and friends in Tehran .

At a dinner party I attended , the female guests arrived in one of the few officially approved forms of outerwear , exposing no more than their faces and hands . As soon as each woman arrived , however , she assumed her preferred image . Some of the women retained their head-gear on account of the mixed company . Some bared their heads , revealed their trendy minis and maxis , and let the men decide whether or not to cast sinful eyes on them .

@@4380237 <p> The University of Western Australia sponsors an interesting competition for PhD students from Australia and New Zealand . It 's called the Three-Minute Thesis : Entrants must present a three-minute summary of their PhD research to an audience of non-specialists . A panel of judges awards a $5,000 travel grant to the winner , who is judged on communication style , engagement and comprehension . The 2011 winner and runners-up all have their presentations on video up at the UWA site , and they are extremely impressive as demonstrations of public speaking . <p> This looks like a brilliant and progressive idea . It attacks the ivory tower ; it builds bridges between specialists and the intelligent laypeople whose tax dollars fund universities ; it encourages the development of teaching and performance skills among people who are going to be teachers for the rest of their lives . Universities have long been criticized for spending too much money on obscure research and not doing enough to teach teaching . <p> All good . But predictably , the vast majority of finalists are in the sciences , not in the humanities . The 2011 winner was a very polished young criminologist talking about advanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dietitian working in intensive-care units ; the People 's Choice award went to a pharmacologist studying cannabinoid receptors . Of 10 finalists , only one was working in literature ( she studies Australian women 's travel narratives as found in blogs ) . There was not one from history or philosophy . <p> Why do I say this is predictable ? Because current advanced studies in the humanities can be more difficult to explain than science is , no matter how complex the science . The vast majority of the Three-Minute Thesis finalists are working on projects with practical applications , not with entirely new concepts . Not one of the winning studies embodied a genuinely difficult idea : The techniques used to gain knowledge may have been highly complex , but what they find tends to be measurable and thus easily explained . You can usually follow the argument just by reading the titles of the talk : " Survival of the stillest : predator avoidance strategies of shark embryos ; " " Nutrition around conception determines the baby 's metabolic health . " <p> Researchers in philosophy or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a microscope , but a technical labyrinth is not quite the same as a genuinely difficult concept . What I mean by concept is something that takes you a few readings to get your head around -- something like , I do n't know , differance , the rhizome , the simulacrum , the uncanny .... <p> Ah , but yes , I hear you saying : here we go -- all that is the cant that has so poisoned the social sciences and convinced them all that they can not communicate with outsiders , the jargon of critical theory that disguises simple ideas with obscure language to make them seem more difficult . You might say : A program like this , one that forces the second-rate theory students into clarity , is exactly what they need . <p> And then we 'd be into a very deep argument indeed -- one that would take much longer than three minutes to resolve . For the past 40 years the humanities have been experimenting with new language to describe fluid concepts , and it 's the very fluidity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- that makes them useful . The idea is generally that we ca n't see the ideological and economic structures that we live in unless we change our language -- for language is a pillar of that very structure . Furthermore , the veneration of clarity or simplicity is itself an ideological position , one that limits thinkers to conventional thoughts . <p> That 's the argument , anyway , and yes , it 's an argument I usually find myself on the other side of . But this competition eliminates it by simply ignoring it . <p> It 's also important to note that the voices clamouring for more emphasis on teaching and less on research among academics are generally conservative ones , who dismiss radical thinking as uselessly obscure . And there are a number of professors who are uneasy about the pressure to work on projects that are most susceptible to being compressed into a life-altering 20-minute TED Conference or YouTube presentation . Some important theorizing is not adaptable to that format . <p> So is there a way to make this clever Australian idea more inclusive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to see condensation and simplification taken to its extreme , look up " Dissertation Haiku , " a blog on Wordpress , where PhD students summarize their work as perfect haikus .

@@4382232 <h> Why public hearings with Supreme Court nominees should mean something <p> For advocates of greater transparency and democratic accountability in the Supreme Court appointments process , Wednesday afternoon 's ad hoc committee hearing -- which gave members of Parliament an opportunity to interview the prime minister 's two nominees -- was rather difficult to watch . <p> The questions ranged from vacuous puffery , such as asking Justices Andromache Karakatsanis and Michael Moldaver to name their personal heroes , to glib and disrespectful challenges to Moldaver regarding his inability to speak French . The broader question of whether Supreme Court justices ought to have proficiency in both of Canada 's official languages is most definitely a legitimate one . And it was certainly not out of bounds for members to ask Justice Moldaver about the importance of language capacity and his intentions to learn French . ( I 'll set aside for now the debate about whether we should make bilingualism a prerequisite for appointment to the Court ) . <p> But by the time NDP MP Joe Comartin was using his second round of questions to ask Moldaver for the fifth or sixth time about the language issue , it had become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning about the judges or the role of the Court and everything to do with the MPs playing politics . Comartin had already asked a question in French to test Moldaver in a manner that could only have been meant to embarrass him . Not only was it rude , it was also pointless ; Moldaver had already expressed regret and pledged to do his best to learn French as quickly as possible . It was as if Comartin hoped that his endless pestering would force Moldaver to quit , which is bizarre enough considering Comartin was on the committee that unanimously approved the short-list from which Stephen Harper named the two judges . <p> That sideshow notwithstanding , the hearing offered little of substance from which to learn anything relevant about the judges ' views on their role as justices or the role of the Supreme Court . It was a stark contrast from the first time a Supreme Court nominee was publicly interviewed in Parliament . The 2006 hearing where Justice Marshall Rothstein answered an array of questions on his views about the Court and its function had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparison . <p> It is important to note that yesterday 's hearing was of little real consequence . The MPs have no power to confirm or deny the prime minister 's appointments . This fact has led some to question why we should care about the public interviews at all . Given that the public interview is the most substantive change in the appointments process , it is worth exploring its value . <p> The major benefit of public hearings like yesterday 's is that they ( at least theoretically ) represent an opportunity for Canadians to get to know the appointees and to learn something about their views on the Court 's relationship with the other branches of government , the Charter of Rights , and their role as judges . One hardly needs to be an expert on the Court or hold a degree in law to develop better questions for the nominees than " who are your heroes ? " or interrogate them , as Comartin strangely did , about the precise date and time they first heard about their appointment . <p> To be fair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as what the judges thought about expert witness testimony or balancing individual and collective rights , but as an informational or educational exercise , it was largely a failure . <p> The fact the opportunity was squandered this time says more about the lack of diligence ( even lack of maturity ) on the part of the MPs involved than it does the process itself . If we ca n't trust the MPs to take the process seriously or to resist the temptation to grandstand , then it may be worthwhile to consider giving others an opportunity to pose questions to the judges . Peter Hogg , who as one of the country 's foremost constitutional experts gave the MPs guidance on what questions would and would not be appropriate to ask , could have facilitated a much more enlightening discussion all by himself . <p> The other argument in favour of public interviews is that they serve as a check on a prime minister who might otherwise appoint an ideologue or partisan to the Court . Despite the sense viewers may have had yesterday that the NDP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is fair to say that the questions posed to a candidate who was not considered qualified would have been significantly nastier . <p> While there is little evidence of overt patronage in appointments at the Supreme Court level , who sits on the bench matters . The Court is an inherently political institution that determines the outcomes of complex moral questions and policy issues over which reasonable people can reasonably disagree . <p> For this reason the common criticism that Harper has sought to make " ideological " appointments at least partially misses the mark because it assumes that appointments under previous governments were somehow apolitical . This is nonsense . Pierre Trudeau 's appointments , for example , completely revolutionized the Court . He sought judges who would apply the law in a more creative fashion , and he succeeded . <p> Appointing judges who would assert Charter rights more readily in the face of governmental policy decisions is no less ideological or political than appointing those who believe the Court 's role should be more limited . It is neither possible nor desirable to remove " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be crafted to avoid the overt partisanship that infects the American process , any process we do design should acknowledge the political reality that different judges approach their function in different ways . That is where a public hearing can ultimately be useful . It is unfortunate that this second stab at the public interview process was n't used to shed light on how judging actually works . <h> Advertisement <h> Post navigation <h> Why public hearings with Supreme Court nominees should mean something <p> Emmett you ignorant slut . Sorry , did n't want to disappoint you . : - ) <p> Anyhow , I disagree that these hearings serve any useful purpose at all . Getting to know all about you might make for lovely lyrics in a song but it 's irrelevant to Canadians who have no say in who gets hired for the job . In the system we have all that is important is how these justices rule and on that score the media has consistently failed to deliver . An analysis of Moldover 's rulings 5 years from now will tell us far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know all about you questioning ever will . <p> Unless these hearing are conducted before the appointments are made and put the power to block those appointments into the hands of the people 's representative , they simply serve no useful function and will remain nothing more than a forum for MPs to play politics . Until that happens get used to being disappointed . <p> Hi Robert , I actually agree with your last paragraph , but I did n't " go there " because justifying a confirmation vote would take another entire column . I still think that these interviews can be a lot more useful . Once on the bench , justices are n't compelled to give interviews . At the very least it would be nice to see them answer some substantive questions about what they think about the job . <p> Mr. Macfarlane , great piece ! Suppose an MP involved in the hearing had sought your advice about probing , illuminating questions to ask the judges . What specific questions would you most like to hear the judges answer ? <p> I 'd love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any issues the Court should not involve itself in ( effectively whether there is ANY " boundary " surrounding the powers of judicial review ; what they think about the Court 's relationship with the other branches ; how they confront the tension between their individual freedom to decide versus the modern Court 's tendency to use compromise and consensus to reach decisions ( when are dissents/concurrences important , etc . ) . Like I said , I thought some of the questions yesterday were OK ( such as the one on experts ) but overall the MPs did n't really do a good job . <p> Great article . It is a shame that Mr. Hogg 's questions did n't get put to the justices and the answers printed for Canadians who are actually interested in learning something about the candidates ' interpretations of the law . <p> Could be worse . They could make us vote for them . At the same time i wonder if mps are not behaving seriously becuse they know they have no power to influence decisions or is it an indication that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all ? <p> Well , one problem is that some MPs are grossly unqualified to be questioning Supreme Court appointees as part of this process . For example , many or even most MPs have no legal training or education . <p> I know this is considered to be a terribly unfashionable view these days , but personally my attitude towards our Supreme Court appointments ( and the process ) is : if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it . Sure , there are some SCC decisions I disagree with , and in some cases quite strongly , but generally our judges have been excellent , the court works well and we do n't have the toxically politicized process that they have in the US . Our SCC is held in much higher esteem among Canadian lawyers than the US Supreme Court is among US lawyers , and that 's because a number of US appointees have been blatant partisan hacks who have demonstrated clear and sustained ideological biases once appointed , some of the most egregious examples being Antonin Scalia , Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Yes i 'd agree with all that . I must say i 'm surprised that Harper has n't tried to place judges who are more favourably disposed toward his view of judicial activism . I hope he retains this attitude . Canada has a right to be truly proud of its judiciary . <p> For example , many or even most MPs have no legal training or education . <p> I 'm a little confused by that .... on two counts . <p> First , I do n't believe that a lack of legal training or education necessarily disqualifies any MP from asking appropriate questions of potential SCC nominees . A fairly basic level of intelligence coupled with an interest in public policy and a genuine ' thirst for knowledge ' should suffice . If we ca n't find even those modest requirements in our MPs ...... <p> Second , if MPs are n't qualified to ' interview ; SCC nominees , WTF are they doing passing new legislation ? <p> On the first point , I 'd just point out that obviously a lawyer or someone with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SCC nominee on complex legal issues than a non-lawyer or someone with no legal training . <p> And on the matter of passing legislation , that 's the thing -- most MPs merely say yea or nay .

( now playing at the Revival ) , their latest Halloween extravaganza , is delightfully Tim Burton -- esque . <p> Led by charismatic hostess La Minouche , which , as she informed us , is French for " pussy ... cat , " the show takes familiar Brothers Grimm and Hans Christian Andersen characters and stamps them with a giant " Rated X.

Perhaps it 's a natural consequence of fairy tale characters growing up ( Alan Moore 's Lost Girls comes to mind ) , but one scene that drove this notion home was the high-flying Rapunzel . Demonstrating the wide range of the show , this well-choreographed wire act had a prince dangling above the audience from Rapunzel 's hair , before falling to his bloody demise . <p> What really stood out in this performance , which many burlesque shows are unfortunately lacking , was its brilliant use of the venue 's space . While it 's a dynamic setting , the Revival has its limitations . The building is narrower than traditional theatres , which means those sitting furthest away from the stage would normally get short-changed . <p> Fortunately , this was not the case . The dancers introduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the bar itself , and often broke the fourth wall to interact with the audience ( the girl sitting next to us was given a shiny red apple from a suspicious lady who later took to the stage ) . <p> Though there were a few technical difficulties with the sound , they were hardly noticeable thanks to the looseness of the show 's host . In many ways , burlesque is meant to be a parody of theatre , and these gals thankfully are n't taking themselves too seriously . But any fans of theatre looking for solid entertainment with a blend of wit and sexiness should consider taking them seriously .

@@4393236 <h> War , weddings , and women : The African Queen <p> October 27 , 2011 <p> CALGARY , AB , Oct. 27 , 2011/Troy Media/ -- As a genre , the combat war film is generally seen as the purview of the masculine , where men display courage , honour , and loyalty , and women are either absent or have only a marginal place in the story . <p> Yet , if we look carefully , we can find female characters who occupy a central place in war films , revealing cultural attitudes to gender , particularly if the social context in which the film was made was a time of tension and transition with respect to the ideals of ' the feminine ' and the changing roles of women . <p> For example , war films reveal much about issues during the reconstruction of post-war Britain from 1945 to 1960 , particularly in their representation of the place of the feminine within them . <p> Marriage , sex , and divorce <p> There has recently been a good deal of academic research on the changing nature of marriage , sex , and divorce in 1940s and 1950s Britain . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitudes towards homosexuality in the 1950s , indicating that , far from being an era of ' unthinking smug conventionality ' , the post-war period was characterized by profound instability , where ' old constraints were falling away ' . <p> The ' New Woman ' was , in many ways , one of the main examples of this instability . As a construction , the ' New Woman ' focused on notions of motherhood , sexuality , paid work , and consumption . Contemporary experts , in particular sociologists , noted these new and complex roles for women and linked the ' New Woman ' to a fresh and alternative form of marriage : the companionate marriage . <p> This is an ideal that has been called ' the most distinctive feature of domestic life ' in the post-war period.While this form of matrimonial bonding was not completely innovative in the 1950s , the concept became more common after the war in Britain to describe the perceived change from marriage as a legal and social institution as it was seen in the 1930s to marriage as a set of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' equality ' , ' partnership ' , and ' teamwork ' . <p> The war film <p> Recent studies of war films have suggested that it is a genre that is far more complex than previously thought and deserves serious study , having been linked to formations of national identity , ideas of gender , and cultural notions of memory.War films have , as a central theme , the movement from innocence to experience in ways that suggest ancient and enduring myths . For author James Clarke , ' war is frequently used in cinema as a means by which to dramatize the enduring issues that all of us face -- mortality , frailty ( physical and emotional ) , community and courage ' . <p> Films tell us about the time in which they were made , rather than the time they depict , making feature films ' a vital source for understanding the social and cultural makeup of modern society ' .

War films can be used to explore the place and role of women in British society after the war , in particular with respect to the concept of the companionate marriage . <p> The African Queen ( 1951 ) <p> As an example , the film , The African Queen , usually seen as an ' adventure ' film , a ' romance ' , or a ' drama ' , can also be seen as a war film , with World War I as the vehicle for conveying cultural attitudes of the 1950s . The film depicts the development of the female character , Rosie Sayer ( Katharine Hepburn ) , moving from a prim and tightly laced and misplaced Edwardian to a more sensual , freer and competent woman . The male character , Charlie Allnut ( Humphrey Bogart ) , is transformed from a drunken , irascible , and unreliable rascal into a daring , resourceful , and stable family man . It is the influence of Rosie that is the stronger , though both have a hand in changing the other . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mission and the Belgian mine , and wrecking everything in sight , Charlie returns to find Rosie has survived , but her Missionary brother , Samuel ( Robert Morley ) , is dead .

Rosie prompts Charlie to avenge what has happened to them and take the African Queen down the river to the lake in order to sink the German naval gunboat , the Louisa . She does so by appealing to his patriotism , his masculinity ( another man , Spencer , had navigated the Ulanga/Bora River down to the lake ) , and flatters him with his ability to make torpedoes . <p> In their descent to the lake , they face rapids , a military fort at Shona where they run a gauntlet of German rifle fire , then past more rapids .

She provides equal service when fitting the repaired parts underwater and dragging the boat through leach-infested waters . Charlie becomes a braver , more resourceful man through her influence , but also encourages her to loosen up with his stories , singing , and his relaxed , easy disposition . <p> They are equal partners , each with different talents , but both pulling together ( literally as well as figuratively ) , sharing the burden of their military mission , encouraging each other when one starts to weaken . Just before their mission begins , they argue about who should steer the boat into combat and who should be left behind . Charlie , as Captain , attempts to order Rosie to stay behind , but this faint-hearted bullying for her own good and safety does not work -- Rosie relents and lets him come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engine while she steers . <p> When the African Queen sinks in bad weather before the Louisa can be attacked , Charlie is captured and sentenced to death by a court martial by the German Captain . Charlie tries once again to protect Rosie by denying all knowledge of her ( after joyously calling her name , surprised that she had survived the storm ) as she is rescued from the water and brought onboard the Louisa . This prompts the Captain ( Peter Bull ) , frustrated at Charlie 's lying , to state , ' I shall hang you twice , I think ' . Rosie says , ' Stop that , Charlie , we 've been through all that . I 'm certainly not going to outlive you and that 's all there is too it . ' Following their walk hand in hand to the deck to be executed , Rosie makes a request that they be hanged together , while Charlie asks that the Captain marry them , as ' it 'll mean such a lot to the lady ' . <p> While in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ African Queen , Rosie exclaims , ' We did it , Charlie , we did it ! ' They call each other by their new , formal married names , reflecting their newfound status . Charlie states to Rosie that he feels ' Pretty good . . . for an old married man ' and he provides direction , as they swim to the eastern shore of the lake towards British-held territory . He then starts to sing the same bawdy song he sang earlier while drunk and Rosie , perhaps not too surprisingly , knowing the words joins in . <p> The African Queen suggests that marriage in post-war Britain not only brings respectability , but also respect for each other , shared experiences , adventure , physical exhilaration , and team work lead to a new form of marriage , one that has more vitality and joy .

In July 1982 , he raped and strangled 11 year old Susan Maxwell , dumping her body some 250 miles from where he abducted her . Just under a year later , he kidnapped and murdered 5 year old Caroline Hogg . Her body was likewise dumped hundreds of miles away , but was so decomposed that nothing meaningful could be determined from it . <p> Finally - as far as is known for certain - he kidnapped , raped and murdered 10 year old Sarah Harper .

The naked , and determined , couple had even refused to acknowledge the presence of police until they finished what they set out to do . Finally , they were arrested for committing an indecent act , to wit : fornicating in public . <p> Lenz sentenced the pair to probation , which included taking out an ad in the Simcoe Reformer apologizing to the public for the embarrassment they caused . <p> Newspaper wire services snapped up the case and Lenz 's father - also named Kenneth - who then had a cottage at Port Dover , was inundated with calls from reporters . <p> Lenz said he made the mistake of answering some of the calls .

Assessments of truthfulness can not be based solely on a person 's demeanour , he said . Other aspects , including the consistency and logic of a witness 's testimony are paramount . <p> The idea of convicting an innocent person was something that often preyed on his mind , he said . <p> " There is nothing more discouraging for a citizen , who truly is n't guilty , to be found guilty , " he said .

The city had refused requests for a wheelchair ramp , Lenz said . <p> Inevitably , there came a day in the early 1990s when a defendant in a wheelchair could not make it into the building .

Lenz said . <p> Reporters are vital conduits , he said , citing the adage that justice must not only be done , but also be seen to be done . <p> Of course , Lenz knows as well as any judge that not everyone leaves the courtroom satisfied , never mind happy . <p> But judges ' hands are often tied by legislation , and politicians legislate -- not judges . <p> The recent push for more minimum penalties is something that Lenz finds troubling . <p> Sentencing is complicated , and so it should be , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including the seriousness of the crime and the circumstances of the offender .

It 's an uplifting experience , " he said , adding that he even presided over his son 's wedding . <p> *** <p> Lenz 's two decades on the Brantford bench have given him insight into some of the needs of the local justice system and the community . <p> " Judges are expensive creatures but the volume ( of cases ) is such that we do n't have enough judges , " he said . <p> With courtrooms regularly overbooked with three or four trials a day , plus guilty pleas and pre-trial , along with ever-increasing caseloads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said . <p> " It 's a struggle and we just do n't have the personnel . " <p> Lenz also would like to see more residential treatment facilities for children and adults with addiction problems .

Despite all his efforts , he has n't been able to collect half of the mushroom he did in 2007 . The reason ; there just are n't enough of the fungi to collect . This year it has been particularly bad ; there was only about half a kg of the mushroom he could find . <p> Normally , there is a belief that there is a bumper production of Yarsa Gumba only every four years . The four years in between is needed to help grow the caterpillar population ( Yarsa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , winter insect ' , is actually a caterpillar entombed inside the body of the mushroom ) . <p> But it has n't been so and Ghyam says it 's because of the changing climate .

For all of us , nursing is a good deal . " / Photo : Owen Egan <p> The expanding scope of nursing <p> By Allison Flynn <p> The integral role nurses play within the Canadian heathcare system is rapidly evolving . Their responsibilities are expanding and their roles are becoming more and more varied . As McGill 's School of Nursing gets ready to play host to a major conference to explore the obstacles and successes in implementing role change and expanding the scope of nursing , the Reporter sat down with Dr. H ? l ? ne Ezer who explained some the changes and how the School of Nursing is charting new directions . <p> There are some complex shifts reshaping health care today . Demographic changes , people living longer , changes in family composition ... all of this putting pressure on an already strained system . How is the profession of nursing adapting ? <p> Nursing has moved with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a major player in charting new directions -- nurses have had to roll with the punches . <p> What are some of the main issues facing nurses today ? <p> Their work has become much more complex with much pressure on the system to provide care . The number of patients nurses can handle on a daily basis has decreased because patients leave hospitals earlier and the ones who remain are the very ill . There is a limit to the caseload of seriously ill patients that nurses can safely carry . As a result , there are n't enough nurses to handle those numbers . <p> The shortage of nurses has been a big factor in actually stopping things from being done sooner . Many of the delays in providing care in hospitals are related to the lack of nurses able to look after the patients . <p> Nurses need a comprehensive education to handle the complexity of patients who are gravely ill and to help them and their families find ways of managing with their disease . No matter what kind of training any health professional has , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hands-on experience to develop the clinical judgement needed to provide safe care . This means that nurses can not simply be " parachuted " from one unit to another , and staffing becomes a big issue . <p> What about these new , advanced nursing roles ? <p> There is a broad range of nursing roles and responsibilities , both in hospitals and community- based institutions . Nursing roles have multiplied and the scope of nursing practice has increased . Many of these new roles have a particular focus -- for example with parents and newborn babies , in mental health or home dialysis -- and nurses become highly skilled in working with special populations . <p> In Quebec , one of the more recent and best known roles is that of the " infirmi ? res pivot , " nurses who have an expanded scope of practice in helping cancer patients , not only at the time when they 're receiving treatments in hospital , but afterwards when they go home . This is a coordination and follow-up role that has been invaluable to these patients , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are also working with them . <p> Tell me more about the Nurse Practitioner ( NP ) programs . <p> These programs are relatively new for Quebec . They were first created in specialty areas -- neonatology , cardiology and nephrology -- to alleviate the demands for specialized care . The newest of the NP program is in Primary Care . It is an attempt to meet the population needs for front-line health care as well as the management of chronic illness . The NP role has been a long time coming in Quebec . There is now a growing understanding of the potential of this role in improving care . The intention of the Minister of Health is to have 500 or more Primary Care NPs across the province in the next five years . <p> This is a frontline care role ? <p> Yes . These NP 's do initial patient assessment ; evaluate and treat minor issues and manage chronic problems . They have expanded responsibilities that allow them to order tests , to prescribe and adjust certain medications . At the same time they continue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health and physical status of a patient , listening , explaining , getting resources in place and helping patients and family members manage their everyday challenges . <p> NPs alleviate the demands on the system . They can deal with isolated everyday events like urinary tract infections or upper respiratory infections -- problems that do not need specialized attention . <p> Another contribution is in helping people manage with chronic illnesses . This can be very time consuming for busy family physicians . In fact , nurses are often better at managing the day-to-day issues related to these cases than physicians are . The physicians are focused on making sure the treatment protocol is what it should be , and the " living with it " is a nursing responsibility . <p> How are patients responding to these nurses ? <p> They love it . Somebody 's listening . Somebody 's asking questions . You get to tell your story , the whole story -- not just where the pain is . <p> Is the NP program helping with the shortage ? Is it attracting more nurses ? <p> At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scepticism but that is rapidly changing . In areas like neonatology , there is a small pool for recruitment because you do n't just pop into these high specialty practice areas without having had past experience . The Primary care program appeals to a much wider group of practising nurses . Since the government has actually said " we need these positions and we will fund them , " there 's been a much greater openness from the Family Medicine Groups to hiring nurse practitioners , and the number of applications to the program is up significantly . <p> Is it a master 's level program ? <p> Yes . Part develops the program advanced practice component -- dealing with complex family situations , negotiating in the system to get best care , etc . The other part focuses on the diagnostic , interpretive pieces related to physical symptoms and health status . <p> When did this program get going ? <p> It started in 2007-08 . We had some start up money from the Dean of Medicine and a three-year period of funding to start the program . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have done extremely well and they are proud of their program . It was a lot of work getting it together but it 's now ticking like clockwork . <p> How big is the cohort ? <p> We started off with a small group that came mostly from the Abitibi region in Quebec . This year there are 10 students at McGill at different stages of study in Primary Care . The plan is to increase enrolment and to graduate12 students a year . <p> The SoN is hosting a conference on November 10 on the expanding roles of nurses . Why is this an important event ? <p> Practising nurses and students just beginning their careers need to focus on the possibilities out there . But really , everyone in the system needs to understand the changing nature of nursing practice . Physicians , the primary professional partners of the nurse practitioners , are likely to benefit the most . This is a time of opportunity , and hopefully the conference will help show that . <p> It is also important to understand the challenges . The scope of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is enormous . If they are to succeed , they need to see things in a critical way , to bring knowledge from a wide range of areas and put it together . So it 's not about rote behaviour . It 's about critical analysis , systematic thinking and working with others to solve problems in a different way . This will be a challenge for those entering the profession . We need to prepare them with the knowledge and skills they need to master these challenges and move health care forward . <p> What 's the barrier ? <p> We need educated nurses all the way up the system -- at the Bachelors , Masters and PhD level . It 's a huge issue as there will be a wave of retirements in the next 5-10 years . <p> Are the changes in the profession attracting more applicants ? <p> They have .

Some countries formally institute it as the law of the land , enforced by the courts . <p> Because many Muslims believe Canada is a secular country , they feel our secular legal system makes it difficult for them to govern themselves by the personal rules of their own religion .

With a teacher certification program finally up and running , it wo n't be long before more studios embrace this quirky new style of practice . <p> Aerial yoga uses silks -- long ribbons of fabric that hang from the ceiling -- to support traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up like a narrow hammock , and the fabric can be spread out so it 's wide enough to sit or lie on . <p> It makes the most difference during inverted poses , where you actually hang upside down . <p> " Using props when it comes to yoga has been around forever , " says Jonathan Farber , the gym 's owner , pointing to the blocks and straps that make up the usual arsenal . <p> Silks are a recent addition to the mix , which means everyone in the class is a beginner . And it can take several classes just to get a feel for the material and to last the hour without having it bunch or chafe , Farber says in an interview the day after class . <p> There are only eight spots , largely to make sure the instructor has time to help everyone navigate what can be a tricky piece of equipment . Sometimes that means there 's a wait list . <p> The instructor , Jennifer Adinolfi , leads the bulk of the gym 's aerial classes , but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Armed with patience and a good sense of humour , she checks in on each one of us throughout the lesson , demonstrating moves again and again and untangling those who take a wrong turn in the fabric . <p> To start , she shows us basic moves on the ground that rely on the silks for support . With the fabric looped under our shoulder blades and anchored in our armpits , we do squats and lunges and a few variations of Warrior pose . <p> We then shift the fabric across one shoulder and move into a balancing posture , Half Moon , that has us standing on one leg and lifting the other while leaning to the side . <p> That 's when the prop really kicks in : the fabric helps steady my upper half so I can hold the pose with the proper alignment , something I usually struggle with during balance work . <p> It 's also genius during inverted poses , completely taking the pressure off the spine and neck . <p> Adinolfi shows us how to sit on the silks , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ V-sit balanced on a fabric swing .

Once inside , the cloth closes in and it 's hard to get into the right position for pigeon pose , much less get a good stretch . <p> What 's more , the fabric often blocks my view , making it hard to see Adinolfi as she explains certain moves .

The head rush feels wonderful , but it can get overwhelming . <p> There 's a steep learning curve for this class , even for those who are familiar with yoga . While I would n't ditch my regular hatha routine for the silks , I can see how this new prop might come in handy once in a while , especially for building balance and core strength . <p> By the end , I 'm totally ready for the relaxation -- and that 's when the hammocks really shine . <p> VERDICT : A great new challenge for those who already practise yoga , but it should n't replace other classes . <p> Bspoke Athletics , 374 Dupont St. , second floor <p> bspokeathletics.com <p> Class : Beginner Zero-Gravity Aerial Yoga <p> Time : Tuesday at 6 p.m. , one-hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( substitute , but teaches most other aerial classes ) <p> Music : Generic world music and chanting . <p> Volume : Background -- instructor does n't even need a mic . <p> Intensity : It 's trickier than basic hatha and some of the sensations are stronger , particularly when upside down . <p> Amenities : One shower in the change room .

Though he 's no longer a soldier , Mr. Proctor is still doing it today . <p> Last year , the 44-year-old father of two started his own security consultancy , which brings a different set of risks than the ones he faced in the field .

With relatively little warning , for example , the revolution in Libya prompted Ottawa to evacuate hundreds of Canadian workers from the country , though many decided not to wait and fled on their own . <p> " The markets opened up , " Mr. Proctor says . " Suddenly people are interested in having training for a situationthat goes beyond what they thought it would .

To say nothing about acquiring a new set of business skills and jargon . <p> Clients can be more demanding than drill sergeants , a realization that does n't come easily . <p> " ' So you can jump out of an airplane at 40,000 feet .

Compared to the Canadian bureaucrats and soldiers to whom he was teaching captivity survival at the time , independent workers in hot spots such as Pakistan , Afghanistan and Somalia were actually in greater danger . <p> What 's more , journalists , diplomats and charity workers often fall into the trap of thinking their professions shield them from risk , and are averse to travelling with a lot of security . Mr. Proctor saw an opportunity -- he believed more could be done to prevent such scenarios . <p> " If you can do better , there 's a market for this , " Mr. Skaarup told him .

@@4404238 <p> On June 19 , 2011 , temperatures in Montreal reached the mid-20s . The children of Outremont were busy , as they always are in summer , scootering down the neighbourhood 's tree-lined streets , or sliding down its wrought-iron banisters . But at the Mile End Library , the residents of the Plateau Mont-Royal borough were ignoring the perfect summer day . They were voting on a referendum about a proposed 400-square-foot expansion of the Congregation Gate David of Bobov , a Hasidic synagogue on Hutchinson . ( The west side of Hutchinson had been rezoned so its residents could vote in the referendum ) . The debate over Gate David 's expansion had been bitter , fuelled by flyer campaigns on both sides . After a day of balloting , the synagogue expansion was voted down . It was a close race : just 53.4 per cent voted ' No . ' So , why the acrimony ? Why the close vote ? <p> The story begins years earlier , with former journalist Pierre Lacerte , and his camera . Lacerte began in journalism writing articles about his world travels for the Montreal daily Le Devoir . He wrote for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Montr ? al -- and several magazines before retiring . In 2010 , he was regarded highly enough to be named a judge for Canada 's National Magazine Awards . <p> When I sat down with Lacerte recently , he described to me the beginnings of another career . A resident of Hutchinson for 26 years , he has spent the last ten years or so attempting to right the wrongs he perceives in Outremont 's tightly knit Hasidic community . " Over the years I saw an increasing number of these people , and , from 2003 , I realized there was something going on that was not appropriate , " Lacerte explained . " I saw that they were doing renovations on weekends , and at night . So I thought , ' that 's strange , ' and I started taking pictures . " <p> Lacerte channeled his anger at the Hasidim into a blog ( http : **38;339;TOOLONG ) , painstakingly documenting all the " illegal " things his Hasidim neighbours do , photographing people , double-parked cars , and through the windows of synagogues . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fervor . " For more than half a century , " reads one post , written in French like the rest of the blog , " the Satmar sect has sacrificed thousands of children on the altar of religious ultraorthodoxy in Quebec . " <p> In 2007 , Lacerte brought prominent Hasidic businessman Michael Rosenberg to the Outremont Council , asking that Rosenberg be kept off a local interfaith committee . Lacerte compiled a " dossier " of photos and documents purporting to show that Rosenberg had been making illegal renovations on a synagogue across the street from Lacerte 's house . <p> Rosenberg dismisses the charges to this day . They were " some stupid accusations , " he said over the phone . " I did n't look into it deeply . " <p> As many in the area know , Rosenberg is a big deal amongst the local Hasidism . He is president of the enormous Rosedev real estate company . You do not mess with him . Lacerte found that out the hard way . Rosenberg sued him for defamation , demanding $375,000 , and asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order was denied by a Quebec court in March , while the defamation suit is still pending . ) <p> Soon , Lacerte became a known character around the neighborhood . When the Plateau-Mont-Royal council gave the go-ahead for the Gate David 's expansion in January , it came as no surprise that Lacerte led the charge to gather the signatures needed to spark a referendum . <p> " I think it 's purely anti-Semitic , " Rosenberg said by phone . " If you look at what Gate David wanted to do , it was not to increase its membership ... but just to add some comforts , to modernize it , put some bathrooms on the ground floor for elderly people . " <p> " He 's just against every synagogue that exists in his neighbrouhood , " Rosenberg added . <p> Since the referendum period began , Lacerte has been written about in the mainstream Canadian press . Some of the accounts have portrayed him as an anti-Jewish crusader . <p> In one recent article , the National Post interviewed a local Hasidic woman who survived the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt " like sixty years ago , " and rolled up her sleeve to show the concentration camp number tattooed on her forearm . <p> However , the fanatical Pierre Lacerte depicted by the National Post -- and by himself , on his blog -- is nowhere to be found when I meet him at Le Figaro cafe on Hutchinson and Fairmont . He is well-spoken , calm , and has faultlessly good manners . He even smelled nice , like French cologne . When my tape recorder ran out of batteries , he pointed me to the nearest depanneur , and reassured me that he was in no rush , and would wait until I got back . <p> Lacerte insists that he is " not an anti-Semite . " He goes out of his way to emphasize this fact . He runs through the bullet points of his life and career : he speaks six languages and claims to have visited over 100 countries . He says that cultural difference has always interested him as a journalist . And he likes to emphasize that he has Jewish friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Devoir about the Jewish Montreal painter Louis Muhlstock , a friend , who died ten years ago . He even " used to date an Israeli girl ! " he says from across the table at Le Figaro , smiling . <p> His secularist ire is n't targeted exclusively at Hasidism , either -- Lacerte also harshly criticizes the " extremist Catholicist " brainwashing of his grandparents ' generation . " With the Revolution Tranquille " -- or the Quiet Revolution , a period of intense secularization in Quebec during the 1960s -- " we were able to get rid of that , and we certainly do n't want fundamentalism of any religion to rule the secular life -- the life of the suburb , the life of the city , the life of the country . " <p> The reason he keeps up his fight against the Hasidim is " not because they are always coming in and out of the synagogue to pray , but that they do illegal things , " he says . <p> Indeed , when he 's not declaiming about altars and ultraorthodoxy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bylaws and zoning requirements . For him , Hutchinson is residential , and should n't be bombarded with double-parked cars , or Hasidism loading onto loud Greyhound-sized buses headed for weekends in Brooklyn . <p> But if we are to accept Lacerte 's allegedly legalistic focus , the question remains as to why he has targeted the Hasidism with such vitriol . Many McGill students can attest to the illegally run loft parties in Mile End . Shady poker games are certainly held in bars and cafes behind closed doors . The construction currently lacerating Parc is easily more disruptive than Hasidic school buses . And , either way , are n't these quaint illegalities and minor disturbances what make Mile End Mile End ? <p> " The best solution is for him to move out , " says Tom Costaris* , who works in a store on Parc , and is married to my cousin . " It 's easier for one person to move than for 20,000 people to move . " <p> Costaris says the neighbourhood 's demographics settle the dispute in the Hasdim 's favour : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not anti-Semitic ; that word is thrown around way too easily . He just feels they get away with everything without going through the proper channels , which they do . But I 'm with the Hasidism , it 's their turf . " <p> A former resident of Parc-Extension , he concluded , " If you live in a Greek neighborhood and everyone is roasting their lambs in the backyard , you really ca n't do much about it , either . " <p> Roasted lambs and illegal synagogue construction aside , Lacerte 's anti-expansion campaign was due in part to his belief that Outremont and Plateau Mont-Royal officials are corrupt , and work at the beck and call of Hasidic leaders . His blog , which often has a conspiratorial tone , offers detailed " proof " that Hasidic leaders ( such as Rosenberg ) are in cahoots with Outremont officials past and present . In one instance of Lacerte 's wit , Liberal politician Martin Cauchon became " Martin Kosher . " <p> " The Outremont government , the Plateau-Mont-Royal , the City of Montreal -- all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch these people , you 're considered anti-semitic , " Lacerte tells me . <p> He describes the Hasidim of Outremont as a flock of misled sheep , who do n't think , and barely vote , for themselves : " They are totally subjected to the leaders of their group . They do n't have the right to read newspapers except for their own , they 're not allowed to watch television . Their only source of information is from their leaders ... They 're brainwashed . Poor people . " <p> In Lacerte 's telling , the memory of the Holocaust is used as a cudgel by Jewish leaders to keep the Hasidic community in constant trepidation . " It 's trauma . But , at the same time , how can you always live only with that and not try and break the cycle ? " he said . " The leaders maintain their people with this Holocaust thing , and that everyone in the world always hated Jews since the Egyptians 2,000 years ago . Is that a way to live a life ? It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to make sure that your people will stay inside the room and not get out . " <p> The notion that Hasidism lead trapped lives is something many Mile End-ers grapple with daily . My mother grew up around Jeanne Mance and Bernard , in a churchgoing Irish family . Her best friend was a Hasidic girl named Rebecca* , whose house my mother had to visit if she wanted to see her , as Rebecca was rarely allowed out of the house . By their early teens , they began to drift apart : my mother continued to do things associated with teenaged years , while Rebecca 's parents looked for potential husbands . <p> Just walking down the street , you see ample evidence of the cloistered Hasidic lifestyle . The long skirts and stockings that Hasidic women wear seem ludicrously unpractical , not to mention oppressive , on hot summer days . And the clusters in which Hasidim walk to synagogue , heads down , talking to no one else , reinforce the barriers between them and their non-Hasidic neighbours . <p> Still , as Plateau-Mont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many in the community rallied around the Hasidim . In a joint attempt to demystify the Hasidic lifestyle and gain local support for the proposed expansion , 37 year-old Mayer Feig opened Gate David to the public two weeks before the June 19 referendum . Despite pamphleting by Lacerte and others , nearly 200 neighbors attended the open house . <p> One of these neighbours , surprisingly , was another journalist with her own two cents to share . A feminist freelancer of Palestinian descent , Leila Marshy showed up to the open house and , along with her partner Kathryn Harvey and a small group of Hutchinson neighbors , decided to create a group that would soon be named the " Friends of Hutchinson Street . " <p> I got in touch with Marshy by email . She wrote that she entered the fray because " Pierre Lacerte and his gang were going door to door with their flyers or petitions .

" She and Mayer Feig played on that their Palestinian-Hasidic friendship a lot . It 's a strong image , " he said , rolling his eyes . <p> Feeling like Marshy came out of the blue , Lacerte could not understand why " all of a sudden she decided to fight for them .

" Mayer Feig refused to comment , wanting nothing more to do with the " ill-intentioned " Pierre Lacerte . <p> With only a Facebook page and two organized activities to date , " Friends of Hutchison Street " has faltered since the referendum . But the acrimony of the referendum period has been given a second life online by the group 's Facebook page .

In one post , she commented that a photo of Lacerte " captures his smugness perfectly .

Lacerte shot back with a link to an article from La Presse , in which the photo was originally published . In short , the Facebook battle has dissolved into he-said-she-said inanity . <p> Despite the remaining tension between residents , Mile End has managed , like so many times before , to recuperate . Molly Tonken , a McGill U2 Arts student who shares a backyard with the Gate David synagogue , said she " loves the neighborhood so much ... this may come off as strange , but the Hasidic community gives it character . Children are always outside playing , and there is a strong feeling of safety . It 's a refreshing sense of community . " Tonken 's genuine optimism may stem from her newness to the neighborhood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Outremont needs right now -- a fresh , even naive , conception of what a neighborhood can be . It 's sad , in a way , that it has taken a newcomer to embrace the pluralism that the neighbourhood could stand for . <p> The underlying irony of the strife on Hutchison can be found , simply , in the name of Lacerte 's blog : " Accommodements Outremont " ) . After a summer of referendums , pamphlets , photos , and snide Facebook jabs , Outremont is no more accommodating than it was before . It is uncertain what the future holds for this neighborhood , as young people cruise in , restaurants turn over , and the Hasidic community continues to grow . But the most recent squabble on the " Friends of Hutchison Street " Facebook page may give us a clue : <p> Friends of Hutchinson Street/ Les Amis de la Rue Hutchinson : " The world population hit seven billion today , now , more than ever , we need to SHARE .

Her message , though , carries a little bit more bite . <h> Related <p> " Remember when President Obama said , ' Let us be the generation that ends the tyranny oil . ' Man , that was great .

The anti-pipeline campaigners have promoted the Louis-Dreyfus spot as Elaine urging Obama to master of his domain on Keystone . Funny . <p> But if you 're an executive in TransCanada 's corporate headquarters , right now you 're probably thinking about burning that deluxe box set of Seinfeld DVDs you got for Christmas a few years back . <p> " Denying the permit for a brutally stupid money grab like the Keystone XL pipeline is a no brainer , right Mr. President ?

@@4406232 <h> HBO , Still Vertically Integrated <p> A few recent developments in cable TV have sort of confirmed that the concept of " vertical integration " -- networks buying mostly shows from their own corporate parents -- is less prevalent than it seemed to be a few years ago . Showtime renewed Homeland for a second season , its best current show and probably the best show it 's had in years ; that show is produced not by Showtime , but by Fox . Starz , which is making a less-than-successful push to be the new HBO , is building part of that push around Boss , a show produced by Lionsgate . FX 's most popular drama , Justified , is a co-production with an outside studio , and the network just won the bidding to get Lionsgate 's new Charlie Sheen sitcom Anger Management . <p> ( That 's also another reminder of how the identity of a network can look different depending on what time you watch it . To fans of FX 's original programming , a Charlie Sheen show seems like a violation of much of what the network has come to stand for . But FX is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and those reruns are an important part of the network 's overall appeal , not to mention its bottom line . That being the case , it had to buy Sheen 's show ; it 's as logical as USA , the NCIS rerun network , signing Mark Harmon for a TV movie . ) <p> A few years ago , it seemed like self-owned productions had a clear advantage : they 'd get more promotion , and the DVD sales would not flow to a corporate competitor . Now with the DVD market declining , DVD sales are not very relevant to a show -- and they were never very big for most TV shows , not compared to movies -- so that might be part of what makes it less imperative to buy within the family , so to speak . <p> An exception is HBO , which is mostly sticking to its policy of complete vertical integration : no more Larry Sanders type deals where they buy from another studio ; almost everything comes from within . ( An exception is Hung , which comes from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Call Me Fitz , as well as AMC 's new show Hell On Wheels . But even with Hung , the DVDs were produced by HBO . ) This makes sense within the model HBO has adopted , since owning their own shows gives them maximum leverage for making them profitable . I wrote about this a couple of years ago , with a quote from HBO co-president Richard Plepler . Overseas sales are an important part of the model , and the network is happiest when it has a show with international appeal , like Game of Thrones . The studio-system , internationally-based model does n't mean that a show will never end early ; this is the network that canceled Deadwoodand is still pondering the question of how long to keep Treme going . It does mean that they have more flexibility in deciding whether a show is working for them , whereas most networks have to depend more on the basic data : ratings , subscribers , advertisers . <p> The HBO model does n't work for most networks and studios , though , because to make @ @ @ @ for you until their contracts are up . HBO rarely even produces shows for outside networks , unless it 's something like Everybody Loves Raymond that would n't be right for them under any circumstances . Most TV studios ca n't afford to operate in that kind of closed environment ; as I 've said earlier , even the studios that spent years producing mostly in-house ( like NBC/Universal ) have concluded that this was a mistake . It does work for HBO , though , at least as long as they can come up with shows that have strong international appeal . <p> It was pointed out to me that AMC is one of the cable networks moving toward in-house production rather than away from it ; Walking Dead is self-produced , while their previous flagship shows were from outsiders .

Additional fees may be charged for trading commissions and for the safe custody of client holdings at a third-party financial institution . The overall cost is often lower than the fees of mass-market financial advisers . <p> Portfolio managers have a fiduciary duty to their clients , i.e. they must act in the client 's best interest . By contrast , many financial advisers are only obligated to offer clients suitable investments . <p> Estate planning is another area where HNW individuals can benefit by seeking out professional advice . Family business succession , providing for children from first and second families , establishing a charitable foundation or arranging assets to minimize taxation are examples of situations where expert advice is beneficial . <p> Chartered Life Underwriters , specialists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advisers holding the Trust and Estate Practitioner designation can advise on such matters . <p> Once estate plans have been fleshed out , HNW individuals should retain the services of a lawyer well-versed in wills and estates to properly document their wishes .

In September Dort-Kyne fell off her bike and crashed into a ditch . She will spend the rest of her life as a quadripalegic . ( Kevin Van Paassen/The Globe and Mail/Kevin Van Paassen/The Globe and Mail ) <p> It is as simple as this : One Sunday in September , Tracy Dort-Kyne flipped over the handlebars of her bike , and woke up a quadriplegic . She was 41 , between jobs in the finance industry , and a single mom with three young boys . Once she is out of rehab , she will need a home renovated for a wheelchair , a handicapped-accessible van and round-the-clock care , likely for the rest of her life , to make sure , among other risks , that she does n't choke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course of her life , that could cost as much as $10-million . <p> Through the health-care system , though , she may not receive much more than a daily bath . She was job hunting when she had the accident , so she had no insurance through work . She 's divorced , so she has no spousal benefits . She had life insurance , but had n't thought of private disability coverage . Yet , in a few months , she 'll be wheeled to the door of the Lyndhurst rehab centre , placed in her family 's care and left , essentially , to find her own way . <p> Not long ago , Ms. Dort-Kyne may well have died before she reached the hospital . But medical advances have significantly improved the outcomes for people who suffer catastrophic injuries such as spinal-cord or brain damage and for those left paralyzed by diseases such as cancer . <p> We know public health care is creaking under the weight of our aging bodies , with home-care needs growing exponentially for grandma . But if the system chooses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a 40-year-old single mom -- what does it then owe to that life ? The problem highlights the inefficiencies in the system , and how little insurance most Canadians have for an unexpected catastrophic injury . <p> Bill Adair , executive director at the Canadian Paraplegic Association Ontario , says many people are stunned to find out the health-care system largely stops at the hospital door . " We have achieved a state of excellence in acute care , and then we completely let people down , and we set them up for failure . " <p> How well we care for the sickest comes down not just to public will , but to the public purse . " A lot of people do n't want to talk about costs in an ethics conversation , " says Anita Ho , an assistant professor in applied ethics at the University of British Columbia . " But we have to put it on the table . And we have to decide what 's a reasonable level of care . " <p> In other words , having saved Ms. Dort-Kyne , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life ? What 's more , when she had the accident , she was doing exactly what Health Canada would urge , living a healthy , active lifestyle . But what responsibility must individuals take , especially if we choose to rock-climb or snowboard off-trail ? <p> " There are fiscal realities , " concedes Steven Fletcher , Canada 's Minister of State for Transport -- and the country 's first quadriplegic MP . However , he adds : " If we , as a society , choose to save the lives of people with very dramatic injuries , we , as a society , must do everything to help those in the people in the long term . To not provide them with the resources to live dignified and meaningful lives is almost cruel . " <p> Every year , about 1,500 Canadians suffer a spinal-cord injury . In the past , the majority were young men in car accidents , but today , paralysis is increasingly caused by diseases such as cancer or by elderly falls -- both markers of our aging population . The risk also has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popularity of extreme sports . <p> Rene Faucher was doing his best to stay fit and serve as a role model for his three young children when he took to the ice for a recreational hockey game in January , 2010 . While playing he tripped and smashed head-first into the boards . He was left paralyzed from the chest down . <p> Today , Mr. Faucher , 42 , has the use of his arms , and after months of rehab he can lift himself into bed . How much more he can improve is a guessing game . <p> He was once named one of the top 40 businessmen under 40 in Ottawa , but not long before the accident he had offloaded his software start-up under less-than-ideal financial circumstances ; his disability coverage had lapsed in November . He was waiting for word on a job , and did n't have any private insurance . <p> ( According to industry figures , only about 400,000 Canadians have long-term-care insurance ; 1.4 million have critical-illness coverage through work or private insurance . ) <p> " You feel you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financially , but emotionally and psychologically , " Mr. Faucher says on the phone from his Ottawa home . In the hospital , he says , " you have this whole support network , and all this care around you , and the reality is you have to leave it . " <p> Patients such as Mr. Faucher recover faster and more fully when good after-hospital care is provided -- they re-enter the work force sooner and are less likely to end up with complications that put them back in costly , overcrowded acute care . An Ontario study in 2008 found that providing respiratory care at home for 27 spinal-cord patients would save the system $5-million a year : It costs about $1,200 a day to keep one in a hospital bed , compared with $25 an hour for a home-care worker -- even around the clock , that 's half the price . <p> Mr. Fletcher , the Transport Minister , suffered his spinal-cord injury when his car struck a moose in 1996 . He says the level of care provided is often based on the assumption that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institution for the rest of their lives . He is still haggling with Manitoba 's public auto insurance over financing his care ; the Supreme Court refused to hear his case asking that the province cover the cost of the 24-hour attendant he requires while in Ottawa . ( Currently , the cost is shared between the provincial insurer , Manitoba health care , and the House of Commons . ) <p> In part because of the publicity around his case , in 2009 Manitoba 's legislature increased the benefits for people catastrophically injured in car accidents . <p> But how much coverage is reasonable ? " It would be nice to think that everyone in an wheelchair unable to work is taken care of , " says Bruce Van Natto , a 50-year-old engineer in Montreal who became a paraplegic after a cycling accident . " I personally do n't think that 's feasible , but they can be a lot more efficient with the money they have . " <p> Mr. Van Natto 's accident happened three years ago , while he was working in Dubai ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But after leaving acute care and moving into his sister 's home with his wife and two children , he found it hard to gain access to programs : " It 's very bureaucratic . " <p> He knows he has been fortunate -- his former employer , Bombardier , rehired him , covering the cost of an accessible home in Montreal . But the family still struggles financially , especially since his wife serves as his attendant , driving him to work and accompanying him on business trips , leaving her unable to work herself . He must pay for a portion of his prescription costs , as well as his catheter and other supplies . " I am still digging into my savings , " he says . <p> Many people rely on friends and families . Mr. Faucher 's wife , Dianne , can cover most of his prescriptions and supplies through her work plan . He can manage with a couple of hours of home care a day , and bought a membership at the YMCA , where volunteers help with his rehabilitation . But when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get a van that could handle his transportation , the family was rescued by friends , who raised more than $75,000 . <p> " We were lucky , " he says . " My circumstances hit a nerve because of hockey , and because of my age with a young family . ... Without it , I do n't know what we would have done . It would have been incredibly difficult . " <p> If Ms. Dort-Kyne had been driving her car when she went off the road , she would have had access to $1-million from Ontario 's no-fault auto insurance . If she had been struck by a car on her bike , she would have received a settlement through the driver 's insurance . Instead , she was training alone for a cycling race , the very model of fitness in an obesity-plagued society . <p> Her accident happened the Sunday before Labour Day while she was coasting down a hill near Collingwood , Ont . Her front wheel lost traction on the gravel shoulder . She had a split second to react : Fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or steer right into the roadside grass ? She went right -- straight into a hidden drainage ditch . <p> A passing student named Mike Hermanovsky found her crumpled in the ditch , her hands limp against her face . " Can you lift my head , " she kept asking him , " so I can breathe ? " <p> Here , the health system operated at its finest : She was soon in a helicopter to Toronto 's Sunnybrook Hospital , where she received specialized intensive care and , miraculously , began breathing on her own with in a few weeks . Now , at Lyndhurst , she receives daily physiotherapy . <p> So far , her part of the bill has come to no more than $45 , her share of the helicopter fee . But in six months , when she expects to leave the centre , the bills will pile up quickly . Her sister has already moved from the United States to help their mother look after Ms. Dort-Kyne 's three boys , but they expect they will need to move , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where her social support and doctors are located . <p> Ms. Dort-Kyne has some savings and some equity in her house , but " the money I have probably could n't even pay for two years of care for myself and maintain a decent lifestyle for my children , " she says , sitting in her wheelchair in the Lyndhurst cafeteria . <p> Home care provided by the province is typically capped at 21 hours a week . The remaining costs could run up to $15,000 a month , says Chris Collins , a personal-injury lawyer who has been advising Ms. Dort-Kyne . And that does n't count additional expenses , such the $40,000 wheelchair that will need to be replaced about every five years . <p> " It 's almost incomprehensible , " says her brother , Robert Lendvai . <p> Her story also raises the question of why someone hurt driving a gas-guzzling vehicle receives greater compensation than someone biking or engaging in a sport . In Australia , a national commission tasked with that question has produced a proposal for a National Injury Insurance Scheme designed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a catastrophic injury , however it happens . <p> The commission has estimated the cost would be $830-million -- roughly $35 per Australian -- and has proposed that it be in place for vehicle accidents by 2013 and all catastrophic injuries by 2015 . <p> Until Canada adopts a similar system , Ms. Dort-Kyne 's case will remain an extreme illustration of why it 's important people seek private insurance when out of work . Between a soft economy and a work force that has become accustomed to changing jobs , more and more people are spending stretches of time unemployed , voluntarily or not . <p> But not many affordable products cover what Ms. Dort-Kyne faces . Long-term-care insurance is expensive , relative to the odds of needing it . Long-term-disability insurance is more affordable , but it typically only replaces lost income . Critical-illness coverage will provide people with a lump-sum payment should they develop any of a list of diseases or disabilities . ( About $120 a month allows $200,000 of coverage . ) <p> But where does it stop ? Should people who ride bikes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who climb mountains ? If , as a B.C. cabinet minister suggested last January , governments should tax smokers at a higher rate , what 's our responsibility to people injured while playing sports , an activity promoted by the government ? <p> For now , Ms. Dort-Kyne 's main focus is to get home with her boys , and eventually back to work . She has been breathing on her own since a few weeks after the accident , and she has able to move her head and make small shrugs with her shoulders . She 's hoping to learn to turn that into more movement in one arm , enough to use devices . " I want to just get things done and move forward , " she says . <p> Friends and community groups have raised some money , but the family will bear most of the multimillion-dollar load . Whether they can manage it is a question for every Canadian , who could , by bad luck , end up in her situation some day . <p> " Lightning strikes and you never know where ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Adair says .

@@4417232 <h> Workplace threats lead to dismissal for just cause <p> The first important decision arising from the Bill 168 amendments to Ontario 's Occupational Health and Safety Act ( OHSA ) has determined verbal threats of workplace violence constitute violence under the new law , which came into force on June 15 , 2010 . <p> Donna Hudson , a former employee of the City of Kingston , Ont. , grieved the termination of her employment when she was dismissed for uttering a death threat against a co-worker . Although she admitted having " anger management problems , " she claimed the termination of her employment was not appropriate . This case highlights the growing problem of incivility threats of violence and violence in the workplace . <p> Hudson had a history of behavioural problems in the workplace , including poor attendance at work . She had become aggressive in a meeting to discuss the issue of her attendance and put her hand very close to the face of the local union president , John Hale . Hudson was given a three-day suspension for misconduct and referred to the employee assistance program . Following her suspension , Hudson took a three-month leave of absence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the workplace , Hudson was involved in another incident of verbal abuse towards a co-worker and was given a warning letter . One month later , she attended a three-hour session on Bill 168 awareness . Thereafter , the city paid for Hudson to attend anger management classes and advised that if she remained discipline free for one year , her disciplinary record would be wiped clean . <p> Two days later , following the completion of her anger management training , Hudson made a verbal threat to Hale at the workplace . Hale had requested Hudson not talk about a deceased friend of his , to which Ms. Hudson responded " yes , and you will be too . " This threat was taken seriously by Hale and Hudson 's employment was subsequently terminated . <p> In the arbitration that followed , the arbitrator made four significant findings with respect to the Bill 168 amendments to the OHSA . <p> First , the arbitrator held that offensive language that is vexatious and unwelcome is harassment , and may in fact fit the definition of violence under the Bill 168 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behaviour that is reasonable for a worker to interpret as a threat to exercise physical force , in a workplace , that would cause physical injury to the worker . The arbitrator went on to find that Hudson 's conduct met the definition of workplace violence under the Bill 168 amendments . <p> Second , the arbitrator held that the utterance of a threat is workplace violence and must be properly reported , investigated and addressed by the employer . The employer does not have the option of ignoring any incident of workplace violence , said the arbitrator . Further , the arbitrator found that the history of discipline , level of seniority , seriousness of the misconduct , impact of the misconduct and likelihood of improvement of behaviour were all reasonable factors in assessing the appropriateness of discipline . <p> Third , the arbitrator held that Bill 168 provides direction on the weight or importance to be given to the factor of " the seriousness of the incident " in discipline . Bill 168 makes it clear the threats of violence should be considered as very serious and should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arbitrator applied Bill 168 to consider the risk of violence in relation of workplace safety .

" Further , the arbitrator asked the question " to what extent is it predictable that the misconduct demonstrated will be repeated ? " <p> In answering these questions , the arbitrator held that given Hudson 's history , there was an intention to intimidate Hale . Further , although there was no physical assault , the threat did cause actual harm . Hale was shaken , emotionally distraught and took the threat seriously . The arbitrator concluded , in upholding the termination , that " the emotional impact of a death threat is considerable , and constitutes actual harm upon its victim . " In a dramatic end to a reasonably difficult case , the arbitrator complimented counsel for their civility to the hearing process , a fitting contrast to Hudson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt Bill 168 is a substantial and important amendment to the OHSA . The purpose of the OHSA is not only to prevent unintentional harm , but also intentional harm to workers in the workplace .

Lang Lang might be the most enthrallingly narcissistic pianist to break into the majors since Glenn Gould ( although a case can be made for Ivo Pogorelich ) .

A former bison rancher from Alberta , he has worked with the government 's herd for 30 years , most recently at Saskatchewan 's Grasslands National Park . <p> At Grasslands you can go days without seeing the bison , such is the park 's layout and terrain .

Bezos chose books because they offered the greatest Internet potential in the mid-1990s , when people were still wary of conducting transactions on the Internet . Books , he reasoned , had widespread appeal , were easy to ship , and lent themselves to being searched on a website ( and titles already had a unique ISBN number , making it relatively easy to create a database ) . <p> Yet , despite Amazon 's frenetic growth , the company did n't post a single quarterly profit for its first seven years .

@@4424238 <h> Coming Out of the Closet as a Liberal <p> This past federal election cycle , I struggled with which party to vote for . At the time the election was called , I had been a card-carrying Conservative for 10 months . I had always thought of myself as being Liberal , but recent late night political discussions with friends over pints of beer had me concluding that I was less of the fiscally conservative Liberal I had always thought myself to be , and more of a socially liberal Conservative . <p> Then the election cycle started , and the more I started reading about what Harper and the Conservatives had in store , a.k.a their not-so-secret agenda , the less I was enthused about being a socially liberal Conservative . Yes , there were some aspects I still agreed with , reforming the age-old relic that is our Senate for example , but then the other issues started oozing out : abolishing the long-gun registry , and shoving an omnibus crime bill down our throats ; a bill so costly to the Canadian taxpayer and so unnecessary that it gave the term " where 's the beef ? " a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some very serious introspection : Why had I been so up and ready to leave the Liberal camp ?

Surely , none of them would have turned their back on their party as I did . <p> I have a friend who I went to CEGEP with who was an adamant NDP supporter during the election , often inciting her Facebook friends to rally the troops and vote NDP . I admired her conviction . ( My all time favourite status update of hers , read something like " Voting for Ignatieff to stop Harper is like chewing off your arm to save your leg .

After all , none of us questioned Mr. Ignatieff 's competency . He was a brilliant man , aptly capable of running our country . <p> So , why were we deafly silent ? The answer to this is somewhat multifaceted in nature , although the primary reason appears to be that there are a vast number of closeted Liberals , especially amongst my generation . It is hard for us to come out and say we do not have the optimistic idealism that is shared by the NDP , nor do we have the persistent zeal that is sustained amongst the Conservatives . The Liberals are more or less the " meh " party . Not so left and not so right , just nicely fit into the Goldilocks zone of political centrism . <p> But is n't that a good thing ?

@@4424240 <h> The fine print of CRTC 's usage-based billing decision <p> The CRTC 's usage-based billing decision is in and boy is it a lot to digest , which is perhaps why there were so many conflicting reports in the media as to who exactly the winners and losers are or will be . After reading and digesting the long document and speaking to a number of the small Internet providers that will be affected by it at the ISP Summit dinner on Tuesday night , it 's hard to see how anybody really wins with this decision . Burdened with the impossible task of trying to make everybody happy , perhaps this was the CRTC 's desired outcome . <p> To understand the ruling , as usual we need to delve past the headlines and the press release . I swore I 'd never use the " devil is in the details " expression , but the demon certainly is in the fine print . In the case of this decision , it 's in the appendix , way at the end , which is a bunch of prices . I 'm not a network guy so I 'm sure I 'll get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few days to digest and crunch the numbers -- so feel free to jump in and make corrections . <p> The key lies in the CRTC 's chosen method of allowing big network owners to charge smaller ISPs based on capacity , rather than by the byte . Bell et al wanted to simply total up how many gigabytes an ISP such as TekSavvy used per month and bill accordingly . The regulator went with a far more complex method -- at least for the average person to understand -- which most ISPs I spoke to seemed to support because it gives them a ton of flexibility in what kinds of services they can offer and at what prices . The system is good , they said , but the amounts they must pay to network owners are wrong , if not wretched . For many of them , this will change the way they do business and/or lead to price increases . <p> The CRTC assigned each big network owner different rates that they can charge based on what each said their costs were . So , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bell 's network , for example , it 's going to cost you $2,213 per 100 megabits of throughput per month . From there , each small ISP has to take a look at what their subscribers are doing with their connections , then do some number crunching . If watching standard-definition video online requires about 3 megabits per second of capacity , for example , that means that 100-megabit block will accommodate 33 users if all of them do in fact watch video at the same time . <p> The ISP therefore has to project how much capacity it will need and purchase accordingly . If the ISP , for example , expects to have 10,000 customers online watching video at any given time , it would need to purchase more than 300 of those blocks , which would cost the company around $663,000 a month . The ISP can purchase less capacity in the expectation that not all of those 10,000 users will use video all at once , which is where the flexibility and planning come in . The danger in buying too little capacity , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed get online and stream video , they may all experience lag , buffering and so on . <p> What the CRTC appears to be going for is the spurring of competition between network owners for the business of small wholesale ISPs outside of its whole regulated scenario . The same 100-megabit capacity block on Rogers costs only $1,251 , or almost half of that as Bell . Naturally , the logic follows that small ISPs in Ontario are going to purchase their capacity from Rogers rather than Bell . If Bell has any desire to keep their business , it is therefore encouraged to offer a better deal than the prices set by the CRTC . In other words , Bell has a big incentive to go off the rate card and give ISPs a cheaper deal than Rogers . Perhaps Rogers will counter by going even lower . <p> That 's a nice idea in theory . Whether it will work is anyone 's guess -- many observers have a right to be cynical because the CRTC has been trying to spur this sort of wholesale-level competition for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More to the point , it was n't so long ago that Bell was trying to kill off small ISPs completely , so there are questions about whether any of the big ISPs even want small ISPs ' business . In any event , indie ISPs at least have that lower regulated Rogers rate to fall back on . <p> That said , Manitoba sure looks good . MTS Allstream 's price for each 100-megabit block is only $281 , or about a tenth of Bell 's . As one ISP suggested , perhaps we should all move to Manitoba , where Internet capacity is cheap and plentiful . <p> For the rest of Canada , small ISPs say these prices are going to result in big changes . The head of one Ontario ISP told me he 's planning to dump all his residential customers and just stick with business users because the economics do n't make sense anymore . Marc Gaudreault from TekSavvy , the provider that has received the most attention during this whole usage-based billing schmoz , says he expects his costs to rise 20 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to predict how much of this extra cost will be passed on to customers , but I heard $15 bandied about by others . TekSavvy , for the record , would have liked a capacity rate of around $800 for a 100-megabit block . <p> Ultimately , the thing that does n't sit right with the CRTC 's whole scheme is that it seems to guarantee that the end subscriber 's cost will continue to go up as Internet usage in general increases . While that capacity price calculation example above is based on people viewing online video , that 's only standard definition . If those viewers start using high-def , the amount they use per second doubles to about 6 megabits per second , which can instantly and dramatically boost the ISP 's cost . <p> Small ISPs might be able to count on gaining more customers with lower prices and higher usage buckets than the big guys , but that growth is probably going to be considerably slower than Internet traffic . <p> As a few people pointed out , this is wrong-headed since it makes heavier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usage-based billing in the first place . As I 've said before , the people in charge of this stuff -- whether it 's the CRTC or the government -- should be encouraging Canadians to use the Internet more , not less . While it is true that network owners must recoup their infrastructure investments , most of that outlay comes from the sunken costs of stringing fiber to homes . Once that 's done , it 's just a matter of upgrading the equipment attached to the end , which is continually getting more efficient and cheaper , which is why the price of bandwidth continues to drop globally . <p> The hope is that the block prices set by the CRTC will also drop and therefore offset the necessary increased capacity , but who knows if that 'll happen or how fast . The big ISPs will obviously try everything in their power to keep those prices as high as possible and the CRTC has obviously been snookered by them before . <p> Ultimately , network investment is not a cost that is continually going to go up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it looks like the prices consumers can expect to pay will .

@@4426234 <p> What a wonderful birthday present ! For the first time in its 60-year history , thanks to acclaimed Russian-born choreographer Alexei Ratmansky and a passel of high-end donors , the National Ballet of Canada has a Romeo and Juliet it can truly call its own . <p> Although , like any complex production , this three-act Romeo and Juliet will take time fully to cohere , Wednesday night 's world premiere was a triumph of impassioned dancing and inventively challenging choreography . <p> Anyone tackling Prokofiev 's Romeo and Juliet afresh must negotiate a quantity of history . The ballet 's Shakespeare-inspired libretto traverses a well known story of star-crossed romance , set in a patriarchic Renaissance Italy of almost tribal rivalries . Prokofiev 's 1935 score was played in concert even before it was first staged . It is widely familiar and severely programmatic . There have been many different productions around the world and from 1964 to 2009 the National Ballet danced one of the best -- John Cranko 's , created originally for Stuttgart Ballet in 1962 . <p> Seasoned patrons of the company will inevitably compare Ratmansky 's new version with the one so fondly remembered and deeply ingrained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is the one they will come to love . It 's fast-paced , uncluttered almost to fault , and less prone to the melodramatic excesses that occasionally pushed Cranko 's staging to the edge of credibility . It even has a few minor narrative twists of its own . And there 's lots of dancing , not just for the major leads but for the whole company . <p> Ratmansky is a ballet classicist but also a choreographer attuned to a contemporary beat . He has a way of making even the most formal steps -- and does he ever love turning steps -- seem fresh , spontaneous and almost colloquial , qualities to which his opening-night cast responded with full-throttled abandon . <p> When the evening 's Juliet , Elena Lobsanova , took a tumble in Act 1 's famous " Balcony pas de deux " -- in Tony Ward-winning designer Richard Hudson 's conception it 's actually more a " Front bedroom pas de deux " -- you could believe it had been deliberately choreographed to communicate the sheer fervour of her love for Romeo , danced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t ? . <p> For the 24-year-old Lobsanova , still one rung below principal dancer , being cast as the opening-night lead in a major new production is a big deal . If anyone doubted her capacity to meet the challenge their concerns have now been firmly laid to rest . Lobsanova is a radiant presence with a physical suppleness of expression that captures every dimension of Juliet 's fast-maturing character . <p> Piotr Stanczyk makes the most of the humour and ribaldry Ratmansky has written into the character of Mercutio . Jir ? Jelinek is a magnificent Tybalt , seething with pent-up hate , while as Juliet 's lovable nurse , company veteran Lorna Geddes could write the book on character dancing . <p> The orchestra propelled the dancing with enormous verve . As for Hudson 's austere sets and sort-of period costumes , opinions are bound to differ .

Walker was the project manager for the construction of City Hall , Telus baseball field , the major 1990s renovation of Rexall Place , the River Cree casino , the Art Gallery of Alberta and the new Epcor skyscraper . His next project , with the contracts freshly signed , is to lead the Ledcor team in building the new Royal Alberta Museum in downtown Edmonton . " I get to drive by things and say , ' I was part of that , ' " Walker says . " It is the most rewarding job in the world . " Many of these projects faced fierce opposition , with people complaining about money being wasted on frivolous things , but Walker is unbowed by decades of facing off against naysayers . " There 's always going to be negative , unhappy people out there that think their money is being wasted . Luckily we have more visionaries out there than the first lot . And politicians , thank God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to do these things . ' " Everyone of those projects , there 's been hair on them . " <p> Hair ? <p> " It 's not a clean job , there 's stuff ( that comes up ) . But they 're fun . " Both the arena and the new museum will adorn downtown by the end of 2015 , Walker predicts , and will work with other new projects to transform the area . " We have the best opportunity of any major city in Canada right now . We have more things happening in downtown Edmonton than any other major city . It 's going to be amazing in the next ten years . " Walker trained as an engineering technologist at Red River College in Winnipeg , before coming to Edmonton in 1975 . He set up his own project management company in 1981 . For seven years in the 1980s economic downturn , he scraped by overseeing small construction projects , many of them on native reserves .

They want to make sure their idea is received and accepted and acknowledged , but getting everyone together is tough to begin with . " Even if things go well on a project , things can off kilter . For example , in the 1980s a group of doctors hired him to oversee building a clinic . It went off without a hitch , partly due to Walker 's management , but afterward the doctors came to him and told him he should take a pay cut . " It went well , " the doctors told him , " so it could n't have been that tough . " In 1988 , Walker hit it big when the city decided to hire him on as the project manager for the new City Hall .

But once City Hall got started and once it got built , boy that building has really been accepted . " Next came Telus Field and the Rexall reno , which saw Walker working for both former Oilers owner Peter Pocklington and the city , and mediating between them and Northlands . " I could n't have them meet all together at the same time . It was n't going to work . They did things differently . Especially Peter and the city .

Without him , we would n't have the soccer or the baseball or the hockey . He stuck his neck out and said , ' I want to do it . ' " Walker and his Ledcor team played a key role in helping the Art Gallery board decided on which of the four finalists should win the competition to renovate the art gallery .

Walker told the board that all the steel curves could be cut out of Stout 's design , but the board decided to fight for more money , eventually getting the budget raised from $45 million to $88 million ( most of the increase was needed for cost escalations during the 2005-08 boom ) .

It makes sense . " His firm will bid on the arena contract . He 's already done some work some digging into the project as a favour to Mayor Stephen Mandel . Walker looked at the last 10 arenas built in North America to see if the $450 million price tag for the Edmonton arena made sense . The price tag made sense , he came to believe .

They 'd been invited by a senior investment manager to talk about the role judgment biases could play in investing , and Kahneman , a finance-world newbie , asked the manager : Who buys a stock when you sell it ? <p> " He answered with a wave in the vague direction of the window , " Kahneman writes , " indicating that he expected the buyer to be someone else very much like him . That was odd : What made one person buy and the other sell ? What did sellers think they knew that the buyers did not ? " <p> The question became one of many stuck in Kahneman 's remarkable brain .

Thinking , Fast and Slow is effectively a summary of a career that broke new ground in the investigation of human judgment and decision-making ; that , alongside Thaler 's , helped found the field of behavioural economics ; and that was recognized in 2002 with the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics ( its recipient insisted he 'd never taken an economics course in his life ) . More than just a summary of Kahneman 's own work , however , it draws on the work of colleagues whose ideas have cross-pollinated with his own . <p> So it 's got " Big , Important Book " written all over it , which can seem daunting . Bless him , then , for being an uncommonly clear and accessible writer among academics . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central tension in the book is between the two modes of thinking in the human brain , which Kahneman effectively treats as characters in a story . And where a poppier writer might have named them something like " Jack " and " Jill , " here they 're just System 1 and System 2 . <p> But their unique characteristics very quickly become clear . System 1 is the system of thought that 's instantaneous and effectively automated ; System 2 channels energy into the more cognitively taxing mental activities , like concentrating and making choices . However , Kahneman writes , " although System 2 believes itself to be where the action is , the automatic System 1 is the hero of the book . " <p> Or , in some ways , its antihero -- because it 's the ways in which System 1 works with , or outright trumps , System 2 that provide some of our quirkiest decisions and most remarkable errors in judgment . That is n't to say that we 'd be better off without it . While it 's responsible for much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ System 1 " is also the origin of most of what we do right -- which is most of what we do . " System 1 knows how to read . It knows instantly that the capital of France is Paris , and that when somebody smiles at you , you should smile back at them . But a more nuanced understanding of how Systems 1 and 2 interact has been the object of decades of research by Kahneman and his peers , and their revelations account for the loss of credibility experienced by the old rational-actor theories , which until relatively recently underpinned much of economic thought . Lots of what gets us into trouble is that System 1 will react with as much ( or as little ) information as it has available , pushing us to reach faulty decisions .

The low-donation countries feature an opt-in model , whereby you have to check a box to have your liver harvested by medical science when you die . You 'd assume that our susceptibility to framing effects like this one are the result of our automatic System 1 jumping to conclusions -- and for the most part , you 'd be right ? . But in fact , the organ-donation rates skew as a result of the laziness of System 2 . As Kahneman writes , people will check the box if they already have an opinion on the subject .

Think back to the proto-Gekko that Kahneman et al . met in 1984 , as susceptible to the illusions of skill and validity as the counterpart he was dismissing with a wave .

@@4428234 <h> Peter C. Newman : Liberal death spiral began before Michael Ignatieff <p> OTTAWA -- The Liberal party was well on its way to a looming death before Michael Ignatieff took the reins and led it to a humiliating defeat at the polls this year , according to a new book . <p> The conclusion is contained in When the Gods Changed , written by Peter C. Newman , one of this country 's most accomplished authors . <p> The book , which hits the stores next week , chronicles the slow death of the Liberals , Ignatieff 's entry into politics from academia , his inability to connect with voters in the recent election , and the rise of Stephen Harper 's Conservative government which is poised to change Canada dramatically . <p> " Despite Michael Ignatieff 's best efforts -- and at times he was unexpectedly impressive -- when the 2011 election was called , the Grits were already dying , " writes Newman . <p> The author spent two years working on the book , which he initially thought would be the inside story of the " coronation " of Ignatieff by Canadian voters . Instead , voters turned against Ignatieff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inability to dispel Conservative ads that portrayed him as a university elitist who spent much of his life teaching abroad and had come home as a " cynical visitor " to further his career . <h> Related <p> " The besieged professor only truly understood how to connect with a crowd at the very end of his time in Ottawa , and could never undo the impression that he was an academic trout out of water , unsuited to wooing the general public . " <p> " The voters sensed that he was n't one of them -- call it the Tim Horton syndrome . He clearly belonged not in the doughnut shop , chowing down with the rest of us , but in his own cloister . " <p> Newman , whose research included interviews with Ignatieff and other key Liberals , also concludes that the party 's refusal to renew itself also played a significant role in the drubbing , in which Ignatieff lost his seat and the Grits were reduced to just 34 seats in the May 2 election . <p> " To place the burden of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was there , acting as a catalyst on the road to ruin . But the catastrophe in party fortunes was less his doing than his inheritance . " <p> " His genuine dedication to the party 's rebirth was offset by its state of disrepair , and the self-satisfied hibernation of its previous leaders . His failure was more a symptom of their careless stewardship than his doing -- but try as he might , he could not halt the party 's disintegration . " <p> In one chapter , Newman writes in detail about the " best interview " he had with Ignatieff -- on the leader 's cross-country bus trip in the summer of 2010 , just months before the election campaign . <p> " I 'm up against the most uncivil and ruthless government in the history of the country , " Ignatieff told Newman . <p> Ignatieff said he realized he lived " in a world where perception is reality , " and that the Tories had gone out of their way to brand him in endless " negative attacks . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son of a gun , but I did n't actually think the whole world would fall down at my feet , acknowledging my superior virtues . No , this is politics . " <p> Moreover , Ignatieff told Newman that he had to fight " for the right to be considered a goddamned Canadian . " <p> " I 've had to fight for everything . . .. And I 'll continue to fight because I 'm angry . You bet I 'm angry . Instead of getting mad , I want to get even . " <p> " Now , Christ knows , I 've made some mistakes . I 'm not on Mars here . But the rap that I ca n't choose and I ca n't make up my mind is not the problem . The problem is that this party needs to change , this party has to grow , this party needs to renew , and I need to give it back its sense of confidence , its sense of fight . We 've got to be aware that we 're not the natural governing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hell of a lot of work to do . " <p> In the book , Newman writes that he could n't help but wonder after the " debacle " of the election if there might have been a different outcome " if people could have only heard the way he talked to me on the bus , and if he 'd managed to make his actions speak as loud as these words . " <p> Newman credits Ignatieff for trying so hard and " remaining civil under impossible circumstances . " <p> " Whatever his faults , he was a patriot and optimist about the country 's future , perhaps partly because he rediscovered Canada so late in life . Nothing stirs the blood more than ' the return of the native . ' " <p> Meanwhile , Ignatieff also told the author that when his predecessor , Stephane Dion , signed a coalition agreement with the NDP in 2008 , he had " doubts " about it from the start . He says he was forced by Dion to sign the agreement , and did it " as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says he was disturbed that as deputy leader at the time , he was not told by Dion on the morning of the announcement that the coalition discussions with the NDP and Bloc Quebecois had been held . <p> " I learned of it in the press . And I thought that 's a hell of a way to bind a party together . " <p> Newman has been writing about Canadian politics for decades -- dating back to his classic volume Renegade in Power , about the Diefenbaker government.In this book , he concludes the country has undergone a dramatic experience this year . <p> " Like it or not , the Liberals have long been our political gods , turning this awkwardly giant land mass into a field of realizable dreams . But the gods have changed . No smaller concept can encompass what happened to Canada in the spring of 2011 -- when for the very first time voters handed a clear majority to a government run by a politician whose ideals and goals seemed antithetical to the country I thought I knew . " <p> Newman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party , but he concludes that it is on life support -- going from the " walking wounded to the walking dead " -- and that its disappearance could spell trouble for the country . <p> " The demise of the Liberals , if it comes , will be nothing to celebrate . We have a polarized two-party system to the south , an example to be avoided by anyone in search of relatively civil and efficient governance . Much will be lost if this ship goes down . "

Hence the popularity of buying in the U.S. , where as Mr. Campbell says " you know what you 're getting " . <p> Other destinations of choice right now are stable tropical nations , such as Costa Rica and Panama . But , he says , " No.1 is the U.S. There 's no question about that . " <p> The financial incentives for buying luxury residences south of the border are obvious . " They 're at a historic low in terms of pricing , " said Chris Potter , a partner in the Toronto PricewaterhouseCoopers real estate practice . <p> Lawyer David Altro , author of Owning U.S. Property : The Canadian Way , also finds high-net-worth Canadians are increasingly attracted to real estate prospects south of the border . He says his clients in the eastern part of the country tend to buy in south Florida , while those in the West are eyeing properties in exclusive California cities such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in Hawaii . <p> The main reasoning behind such preferences is ease of access . Direct and relatively short flights mean less stress and hassle in travelling back and forth between Canadian and U.S. homes . <p> " They are also liking those areas because they have health care there , too , " he says . " But the bottom line is , we like to go south in the winter to get out of the Canadian weather and play golf and go to the beach . So no matter what the U.S. real estate market is like , it 's always going to be busy . " <p> Mr. Altro says many boomers and high-net-worth Canadians are taking up permanent residence in the U.S. With a much lighter tax regime " on a regular annual income basis , " he points out , " we have a steady stream of high-net-worth Canadians who are moving to the States .

" <p> Hunter Milborne , a partner at Sotheby 's International Real Estate , explains why buying a property needs to be planned correctly . If a Canadian owns a property personally , " they have a fairly onerous estate tax on inheritances whereas if you own something corporately or through a trust , then that 's not the case . " <p> For Mr. Campbell , another issue implicit in owning foreign property is having sound insurance advice . " Being such a litigious country , you better have an incredibly good insurance agent for liability , fire and all the things you need to protect yourself for down there , " he says . <p> " If you 're buying into a gated community or a high-end condo , check to make sure how many of those properties are actually in use , as opposed to being in arrears , foreclosure or owned by a bank , " he says . <p> " Because the community still needs money to run ... a lot of people who buy into those semi-deserted gated communities because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operating costs can start to really go through the roof .

The outsourced phone personnel cheerfully assisting me in this endeavour swear I wo n't be responsible for the actions of my ghostly profligate . <p> At that last statement , blithely offered up by Amal in Bangalore or Vitash in Mumbai , I can only laugh .

( Zombie computers , it turns out , are significantly more frightening than their human counterparts . ) The book reads like William Gibson 's Neuromancer , lightly updated and thoroughly fact-checked . Ultimately , it functions as a moral tale that morphs into a tragedy : " In humanity 's relentless drive for convenience and economic growth , we have developed a dangerous level of dependency on networked systems in a short space of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- you pick the $5 word -- all contribute to the free-for-all .

Everything and everyone is connected , hitched unwittingly to a planet-wide network of organized malfeasance . Glenny 's weltschmerz is as simple as it is pitch black : Globalized commerce leads to globalized crime . He possesses a savant-like ability to make startling links , and the investigative jones to follow up any far-flung lead right to the bitter end . <p> This approach can occasionally seem hyperactive : Mandy Wiener 's closely observed Killing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suburbs , and yet does a better job detailing how developing-world politics and underworld crime are intertwined . But Glenny is one of the few pundits to identify and understand the implications of globalization on criminal networks , whether they are working on the streets of Napoli with a Tek-9 , or in a Dunkin ' Donuts with an Acer . His latest book is a deep investigation of the eponymous DarkMarket , a carding site that was the virtual home to a gang of geek ne'er-do-wells in the late ' 00s . They broke into online bank vaults using worms , bots and spam bombs , grabbing the coded particulars belonging to tens of thousands of human souls . They also traded in my very own b ? te noire , the MSR 206 skimming machine , helping to install them at ATMs , restaurants , gas stations , everywhere .

It takes them a weekend to blow $400,000 of your hard-earned money , easily replenished online the following day . <p> Glenny leads us across the planet , following the carders and the ( lamentably few ) cops on their trail . At the heart of Glenny 's story lurks the tragic paradox of our age : " Crime detection and civil liberties have always been uneasy bedfellows , but their coexistence has been significantly more troubled since the spread of the Internet .

He links cyber-crime to the Russian mafia , who have risen to such infamy because they practise ultra-violence as a form of high art .

@@4428239 <p> If you asked serious MMA fans to rattle off a list of the top fighters in the history of this sport , how long would it take them to get to Dan Henderson ? <p> Current stars like Anderson Silva and Georges St-Pierre would be mentioned quickly , with legends like Randy Couture and Fedor Emelianenko following close behind . Chuck Liddell , Tito Ortiz , Frank Shamrock , and Royce Gracie might come up as well , along with Wanderlei Silva , BJ Penn , and Matt Hughes . Pride fans would n't feel the list complete without Cro Cop , Shogun , or " Minotauro " Nogueira , and maybe Sakuraba as well . <p> That 's 15 fighters , and there are several others who could be tossed out there as well , some more deservedly than others . <p> Henderson is one who does n't immediately come to mind when first asked , but when you stop to think about his accomplishments , look at his resume , and hold it next to some of the aforementioned names , you start to realize what I came to discover earlier this week : <p> Dan Henderson is one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does n't get enough recognition . <p> No matter how you want to measure success , Henderson sits among the best in the history of this business . <p> Along the way to 28 career victories , Henderson has defeated luminaries like Fedor , " Minotauro , " and Wanderlei Silva when he was at the height of his dominance in Pride . He 's added wins over Renato " Babalu " Sobral and Murilo Bustamante -- beating both men twice -- along with Vitor Belfort , Rich Franklin , Michael Bisping , Renzo Gracie , and Murilo " Ninja " Rua . <p> Less than three years into his career , Henderson beat Gilbert Yvel , Nogueira , and Sobral in the same night to capture the 1999 King of Kings Tournament . <p> While there are have been some easier wins along the way as well , you 're going to find the same holds true for all the legends in this sport . At some point , everyone gets thrown a batting practice fastball and hits it out of the park . <p> Where I really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get the recognition he deserves -- is for being the only man in the history of the sport to hold two titles in two different weight classes simultaneously . <p> One of the accomplishments that lands both BJ Penn and Randy Couture high up on the list of all-time greats for many people is the fact that they won championships in two different weight classes in the UFC ; Penn having held the welterweight and lightweight titles , Couture the heavyweight and light heavyweight straps . <p> Henderson held both the welterweight and middleweight titles in Pride when the company closed their doors , resulting in Henderson fighting in back-to-back title unification bout when he made his way to the UFC in 2007 . <p> No one else has ever come close to holding two belts in two different weight classes at the same time . <p> When we enter into pound-for-pound debates , we bring up athletes who might be able to win a title in another division as evidence of their placement in the rankings -- Jose Aldo could go up to ' 55 and win the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 45 , and so on . <p> Henderson has done just that , but people seem to breeze past the accomplishment or fail to give him the respect such an achievement commands . If Penn 's winning two titles in two different divisions four years apart establishes " The Prodigy " as one of the greatest of all-time , why does n't holding two belts simultaneously do the same for Henderson ? <p> In the last three years , Henderson has earned victories over top 20 opponents in three different weight classes -- middleweight through heavyweight -- and lost only twice in that stretch , both defeats coming in middleweight championship bouts . <p> What hurts Henderson 's legacy is his inability to capture gold in the UFC and his understated manner . <p> He was overshadowed during his time as a coach on The Ultimate Fighter by his more boisterous adversary Michael Bisping , but got the better of their meeting when it mattered most at UFC 100 . Unfortunately for Henderson , that is his signature win in the UFC thus far , as he came up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Quinton " Rampage " Jackson and Anderson Silva at UFC 75 and 82 respectively . <p> In a way , he 's a lot like Rich Franklin , who has become the Wally Pipp to Anderson Silva 's Lou Gehrig in the UFC middleweight division . <p> Despite his success pre-Silva ( and even post-Silva for that matter ) , Franklin has become a forgotten champion in the wake of Silva 's unprecedented run of success in the 185-pound ranks . Like Franklin , Henderson 's tremendous achievements have been overshadowed by more memorable performances on bigger stages , relegating him to the second tier of all-time greats in the eyes of many . <p> Prior to sitting down to think about it this week , I too passed over Henderson when compiling my list of all-time greats in MMA , for exactly the same reasons mentioned above . <p> I never saw his greatest successes first-hand , and only tend to think of his post-Pride career , which is an unfair measure of the achievements of the 41-year-old fighter . <p> Those 22 wins , five losses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Henderson stands amongst the all-time greats in this sport . <p> The more I look at his list of accomplishments , the more I realize Henderson is one of the best in MMA history -- even if it takes a little longer to remember that fact from time to time . <p> We encourage all readers to share their views on our articles and blog posts .

@@4428240 <h> Opinion Editorial <h> Vigilante justice can be dangerous for " heroes " : OUR OPINION <p> Vigilante justice is an unacceptable response to crime . There is no Batman . <p> But three Vancouver teenagers certainly made their point by setting up video-taped stings to expose men interested in sex with teen girls . <p> The point is that if these predators can use the Internet to lure youths , it can be used to expose them , too . <p> At the very least , their actions should make other adult predators think twice about trying to hook up with teenage girls . <p> The Vancouver teens used fake Internet pics and went on ' Plenty of Fish ' , a dating website . They started conversations there , pretending to be teenaged girls and arranged to meet men in public places . <p> Two of the teens dressed like comic book superheroes -- Batman and The Flash -- confronted the men in a parking lot , restaurant or playground and accused them of being pedophiles -- while the third teen filmed the encounter . <p> The videos were then posted on YouTube and called ' To Troll a Predator ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following there -- as four encounters with men were posted . <p> But the RCMP found out what the teenaged vigilantes were doing and shut them down ; the teens did n't help themselves by saying they were working with police , which was obviously untrue . <p> Police ordered the YouTube videos to be removed for privacy reasons . They were taken down officially , but copies have been reposted . <p> Chilliwack RCMP are , however , looking into the information gathered by the boys -- two are 17 , one is 18 -- and have talked to them and their parents . <p> Police do what these boys did , disguise themselves as underage girls and use online chat sites to lure sexual predators . But teenagers are not police officers . <p> A member of the RCMP integrated child exploitation unit said the teens put themselves at risk by luring predators , not to mention put potentially dangerous offenders in public places . <p> " If you are dealing with someone who has a sexual interest in children , that 's not going to disappear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one shape or form , God knows what may happen , " Corp . Mat Van Laer told The Canadian Press . " You do n't want that type of deviance being enticed . " <p> Police say the teens did n't have malicious intent , they did n't mean to do any harm , but also did n't realize the potential consequences of their actions . <p> Perhaps their intent is related to the Penn State issue , where a former assistant coach of the university football team , Jerry Sandusky , is charged with child sex abuse dating back to 2002 . <p> Penn State President Graham Spanier and former legendary coach Joe Paterno were fired , ostensibly for doing nothing about the allegations relating to Sandusky -- who says he is innocent .

@@4439232 <p> This can be a delicious time for enthusiastic home cooks , many of whom derive special satisfaction from creating the slow-cooked soups and simmering stews so suited to the season . It 's also a good time to try out the latest kitchen tools . <p> The latter includes overconsumption of salt . According to Health Canada , the average Canadian gets about 3,100 mg of sodium daily , far above the basic requirement of 1,500 mg . It 's a big enough deal that they 've struck a working group to encourage us to cut back . For information , go to www.hc-sc.gc.ca and search for " Sodium Reduction Strategy . " <p> Grinding coarse salt with a mortar and pestle is one way to become more aware of how you 're using . When you have to work for it , you tend to pay attention ! Pick up a marble set for about $15 from Ikea ( www.ikea.ca ) or order a pretty little model in colourful enameled cast iron from Kitchen Stuff Plus ( www.kitchenstuffplus.com ) for about $15 . <p> Choosing pepper over salt will also help . But rather than using the timid ground stuff that comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them just before adding to the dish . It makes a world of difference . <p> Check out Trudeau 's Professional series of salt and pepper mills , which have super-sharp , adjustable , carbon-steel grinders . I like the 16-inch stainless pepper grinder , which adds a sculptural touch to the table . Prices range between $15 and $75 . <p> Those changes alone wo n't do the trick , as over 75 per cent of sodium we eat comes from processed and prepackaged foods . Cutting back on those might be easier than you think . A meal of grilled chicken , along with a side dish of curried quinoa and green salad is just as easy -- and possibly quicker -- than waiting for burgers at the local fast food joint . And you 're in charge of the seasoning . <p> Non-stick pans are great for such meals ( and they shave time off the cleanup ) .

It 's also got good conductivity and is scratch-resistant . You can use it for searing at high heat and it deglazes beautifully . Metal utensils can be used on it , and the 11-inch deep fry pan comes with a tempered glass lid that 's also oven-safe . <p> It has almost replaced my longtime fave non-stick option -- a well-seasoned cast-iron pan which , while effective , is heavy .

Homemade salad dressings are super-easy . For tips , go to my blog ( the website is given down below ) . <p> Mayonnaise can be whisked by hand but it will be smoother with a hand blender . De'Longhi 's new Triblade hand blender ( $100 ) comes with a small but mighty chopper , but it 's the whisking functions that stand out for me ( www.delonghi.com ) . <p> The wand has a little indent at the top , which makes it easy to hold and manipulate .

@@4456234 @ Nutrient and Chemical Interactions in Marijuana Growing <p> For a plant to grow , it requires the correct temperature and humidity , moisture , light , air , certain nutrients and the absence of disease-causing organisms . Plant nutrition is the science which studies what plants eat , or more to the point , which nutrients the plant takes from its surroundings . The proportions of nutrient assimilated -- and in what amounts -- is of great importance to anyone who is interested in maximizing the potential of their green . <p> A hydroponic nutrient solution is composed of water , dissolved air and a dozen or so essential elements in the proper proportions . The essential elements must be present for proper plant growth and development . The elements that make up a nutrient solution should be a complete array of chemicals , containing every essential element required by all green plants for optimum growth . The nutrient should be well-balanced , containing enough of all essential elements so no deficiency occurs , while not containing too much of any element that might lead to a toxicity . Also , the nutrient should be pH-adjusted , preventing the pH from drifting too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The last and maybe most important requirement is that the nutrient solution be water-soluble . The nutrients used should readily dissociate into elemental ions and not contain any toxic chemicals or elements like heavy metals ( lead , mercury or tungsten ) . This is controlled by the selection and purity of the raw ingredients used . <p> The nutrient solution you 're using is basically a cocktail of various chemicals . These chemicals can react to each other in a process called covalent bonding and form new chemicals that you do n't want . You do n't want them because your plant ca n't use them . <p> Covalent bonding is the bane of the hydroponic gardener . Avoid it at every corner . This is easier said than done in some situations , but you have to know what you 're up against . <p> In every covalent bond that occurs , some energy is used . This energy is taken from the surroundings in the form of heat , chemical energy , or light . If you have to mix up large batches of nutrient solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your solution in the dark and above all , keep your solution cool . Keeping the solution cool and dark will deny the chemicals the energy required to do what unstable chemicals want to do -- form stable covalent bonds . <p> The first chemical to pursue a covalent bond is usually iron . Iron is notoriously free to form bonds with just about anything that passes by . If you must add it to your nutrient solution with other trace chemicals , do it just before you deliver the solution to the plant . This will give the roots a fighting chance with the other chemicals in the solution , including the iron itself . <p> This process of covalent bonding is largely dependent on the pH of the solution the chemicals are suspended in , in this case water . With the chemicals being used in your average hydroponic solution , a chemist would say that the optimum pH would be 7.0 , which is neutral . The reasoning behind this is that in keeping the solution neutral , covalent bonding of the constituent parts of your solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants like a different pH level for optimum growth , you have to cater to your joy , lower the pH , and take the slight loss of nutrient value . Fast-growing leafy plants generally like a lower pH in the range of 5.2 to 5.9 . Fortunately , a lower pH will bond fewer nutrients of the type in your solution than will a higher pH . If you let the pH value go beyond the optimum range of 5.2 to 5.9 , you 're opening yourself up to undesirable levels of nutritional deficiency and toxicity , both of which can seriously impede growth . Be vigilant . <p> In your research of the various hydroponic methods in use , you might have realized that most of the growing media in use is relatively inert ( rockwool , pea gravel , sand , etc . ) . That is , the growing medium wo n't react with the nutrients in the solution . For those methods that use inert media , a pH of 5.2 is recommended for optimal elemental uptake . It is at this pH level that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficiently . If the root has to work less to assimilate the required nutrients , the rest of the plant will benefit . <p> At this point , those old-hand stoners who have been growing since the 60 's will shake their heads and tsk-tsk you . They will swear by a neutral pH of 7.0 for the nutrient solution ( if they check the pH at all ) . New research has shown that this lower pH value is the optimum for green leafy plants that grow this quickly . My own experiments with this lower pH have convinced me -- the buds were plentiful and fat , and the shake made couch-glue hash oil that was to die for . <p> You would n't normally have any nutrient solution feeding a newly cut clone , so the PPM of your solution at this stage is n't an issue . Young , established seedlings or rooted clones however , are generally started at 500 to 600 PPM . This value is increased to 800 to 900 PPM during the peak foliage growth period . During the flowering period , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's a lot of nutrient , and it 's needed , every drop . It is at the flowering time that your plant will need the most resources . <p> After the flowers have grown to buds , you 'll have to think about flushing the chemicals from your new creation . At this time , the plant still needs nutrients , but at a lower concentration . It is recommended then to reduce the concentration to 400 to 500 PPM for a couple of days to leach out the nutrients that have built up -- you do n't want to end up smoking them . <p> It is at this point that some people like to starve their plant to stimulate the survival response of generating more natural oils within the plant that will combat dehydration . This controlled drought has been shown to increase the levels of oil in the plant , and thus the THC ( the good stuff ) . <p> The optimum temperature for hydroponic solutions in general is said to be 24 degrees Celsius . It is at this temperature that most elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into your nutrient solution . Some might make the point that increases in temperature increase the rate of photosynthesis , and this is true . You must , however , cater to the nutritional needs of your plant and avoid exceeding the maximum listed temperature of 25 degrees Celsius for your solution . Some of the fancier hydroponic setups have the root/solution area separated from the growing/foliage area . The growing/foliage area is kept warmer than the root/solution area , thus getting the best of both worlds . <p> Measuring pH is relatively easy , and you have quite a few choices in terms of methods . The most inexpensive and low-tech method entails taking a sample from your solution . It is put into a clean vial you get with the pH kit . You test for the pH by putting a drop of the something-or-other liquid that came in the kit into the vial ( NOT the solution ) . The something-or-other makes the nutrient solution change color , usually shades of green or blue-green . This color is then compared to a color chart that comes with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the solution . This low-tech solution poses some obvious limitations , not the least of which is the difficulty in deciding which color is closest if you 've been into the fruits of your previous harvest . The kits sell for 5 to 10 dollars . <p> The method I use is a dead on balls accurate method , and involves buying a relatively inexpensive pH meter . The meter tests the pH down to a tenth of a point , and has proven itself indispensable -- a good buy for $59.95 . <p> Another meter tests the concentration of these elements in the solution as a whole , and is measured in Parts Per Million ( PPM ) . There 's no way around this one , people . If you want to control the PPM of your nutrient solution , you have to buy the meter . Prices range from about $60.00 to $300.00 . If you 're only growing a one-shot crop or just a few at a time , get the cheaper meter or mix the nutrients per gram according to the labeled instructions . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your friends , spend a bit more and get the reliability that comes with a quality product . <p> So now you know what pH and PPM are and how covalent bonds are dependent upon them . Great . And what do you do with this newfound knowledge , you ask ? Simple . You add acid to it . <p> Knowing what to add and when is paramount to your success as a joy-joy grower . When the pH level is too high ( alkaline ) , it can be lowered with saltpeter , sulfuric acid or phosphorous . When the pH value is too low , it can be raised with calcium carbonate , lime or , potash . Most fertilizers cause a pH change in the nutrient solution . Adding fertilizer to the nutrient solution almost always results in a more acidic pH . Adjust accordingly . <p> The proper way to handle all of these chemicals is important . The first general rule is that you do n't do it when you 're too stoned . Just do n't do it -- the plants can miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use glass or plastic , never metal . The nutrients will react with the very free elements in the metal and mess up your nutrient ratios . Glass or plastic does n't have that problem , so get your butt to the kitchen section of the nearest department store first . <p> Never add the acid to the vat of nutrient . Fill a small glass container with the nutrient to be balanced and add a few drops of the necessary chemical . Stir it in well and add small amounts at a time to the large vat of nutrient until the proper pH balance is achieved . That 's all there is to it . Now you 're in business . <p> As time goes on , the amount of salts produced by the breakdown of fertilizers in the medium causes it to become increasingly acidic . Eventually , the concentration of these salts in the medium will stunt the plant and cause browning out of the foliage . Also , as the plant gets older its roots become less effective in bringing food to the leaves . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ensure that your plant is getting all of the food it needs , be sure to flush your system with clean , pH balanced water every couple of weeks . Do this in lieu of that cycle 's feeding . <p> There 's always been a big debate over when to adjust your pH -- before and after you add nutrients to the water , or just after . After 20 years of growing , I 've found the answer -- do both . The reasoning for doing both is that water is rarely dead-on neutral . It 's either acidic or alkaline , depending on your region . The way the professionals do it is to render the water neutral first ( pH of 7.0 ) . You would then add your nutrients to that chemically neutral solution and adjust to the desired range within 5.2 to 5.9 pH . <p> There are a number of hydroponic nutrients on the market these days but they mostly fall into one of two categories -- liquids or powders , and these can be either one- or two-part formulas . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquid ( one- and two-part ) grow and bloom nutrients . <p> Powder nutrients are more concentrated than liquids and are usually less expensive . Powders should be dissolved in hot water to make a liquid concentrate , and not be used by adding the powder directly to the tank . This should be done to insure that the powder dissolves completely . If a liquid concentrate is to be made from a two-part powder formula , it is essential that the final volume of the two solutions be the same . <p> Liquid nutrients are more popular with most hydroponic gardeners because they are easier to use .

@@4460230 <p> The Radiohead Jazz Project may seem like an oxymoron -- what does a cerebral , unswinging alternative rock band have to do with jazz ? -- but it 's actually a reflection of the fact that Radiohead 's music is terrifically popular among younger jazz musicians . A concert at the Rex in Toronto this weekend plans to showcase both sides of Radiohead 's jazz appeal . <p> The Allure <p> Jazz interpretations of Radiohead songs have been around since the late nineties , when Brad Mehldau began playing Exit Music ( For a Film ) with his trio . Mehldau has recorded three versions of the tune , and a host of other jazz acts -- Jamie Cullum , Chris Potter , Robert Glasper , the Bad Plus -- have added Radiohead songs to their repertoire . <p> What 's the allure ? " I think it 's because the music it 's a little more introspective , a little more intense , " says Josh Grossman , the Toronto Jazz Orchestra 's artistic director , and the organizer of the Rex show . " There 's a lot of thought that goes into it . " <p> Guitarist Don Scott , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Radiohead appeals to jazz musicians in a big , bad way because the music is more complex than your average rock band .

@@4460231 <p> Last week , Nikki Heim trudged through early-season snow in Banff National Park , collecting memory cards from cameras monitoring the 41 experimental underpasses and overpasses traversing the Trans-Canada Highway -- the largest complex of wildlife-crossing structures in the world . <p> Later in the afternoon , the research assistant with the Highway Wilding project began the onerous job of viewing and logging thousands upon thousands of images . Many showed deer nibbling on brush near the camera , triggering the remote shutter with their movement . There were also plenty of grizzly , moose and cougars , which , after years of avoidance , now routinely use the structures . <h> Multimedia <h> gallery <p> Then , without warning , Nikki let out a lung-bursting scream of joy . On the chilly night of Nov. 16 , at 1:09 a.m. , a lone wolverine had scampered across an overpass near Sunshine Village Exit . After 15 years of monitoring , and more than 200,000 wildlife crossings , this was the first recorded use of an overpass by the wily wolverine species -- and the gold seal of approval for the structures . <p> " The passage was symbolic , " says Tony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a decade studying the effect of the Trans-Canada Highway on wildlife populations in the mountain parks . <p> And it could n't have come at a better time for the wolverine -- Gulo gulo in Latin , or double glutton -- which may be the most enigmatic critter in Canada . It is certainly one of the least understood . <p> Known colloquially as " skunk bears , " they are related neither to bears nor wolves . For centuries , trapper yarns have portrayed the animals as unscrupulous , savage , stinky , cabin-ransacking demons . More recently , X-Men movies have furthered the confusion , for , despite steel claws and generous fur , Hugh Jackman 's character is simply too wimpy when measured against the real deal . Exceedingly few Canadians will ever see a wolverine in the wild , and besides , who would recognize one if they did ? <p> Until recently , science has overlooked these animals ( while researching fashionable mega-fauna , such as caribou and bear , in minutiae ) and today even the most fundamental questions remain unresolved . Ecologist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Alberta foothills . When I ask him the extent of the wolverines ' current range in Canada , he hesitates : " The honest answer is , I do n't think anyone really knows for sure . " <p> Hudson 's Bay Company records show a substantial number were killed during the halcyon days of the fur trade . The advent of repeating rifles and steel jaw traps decimated populations , but it was the widespread introduction of predator poisons across North America during the 1960s and ' 70s that turned the animal 's greatest strength -- its supreme ability to locate scraps of meat scattered about a landscape -- into a ruinous liability . In a few short years , wolverines were extirpated from the Lower 48 , and savagely beaten back across Canada . <p> Surviving populations are centred in the northern tundra and along the spine of the Rocky Mountains . " A few may still exist in Labrador , " Fisher says , where unconfirmed reports surface occasionally ( although no concrete evidence has been found since the 1970s ) . Ditto for Quebec @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their range hovering just above the most northerly logging concessions . They wander the boreal forest , but to what extent is anyone 's guess . <p> How on earth could we know so little about this animal ? <p> " You try putting a collar on a slippery , tube-shaped animal that is hell-bent on getting it off , " Fisher laughs . <p> The deeper truth is that wolverines are difficult to find , and even harder to observe . They are blessed with the endurance of a marathoner , the speed of sprinter and the mountain-climbing ability of a goat . Chasing a wolverine through the wilderness is like pursuing the Terminator . <p> Fisher , one of just a handful of wolverine researchers in Canada , has never seen one in the wild . <p> In the past five years , wolverine research has increased exponentially , aided by recent advances in survey techniques ( including " log cabin traps , " DNA hair-snagging , GPS implants , aerial surveying and remote camera placements ) . And the portrait now emerging is of a fearless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- like all their mustelid brethren , including marten , ermine , minks , ferrets , badgers , fishers and otters -- tick at a higher metabolic rate than other animals . They keep on the move both day and night whether raiding eggs in the nest , gobbling ripe berries or taking down a big-horn sheep , patrolling the landscape at will . One travelled 800 kilometres , and visited three American states , in 10 days . Another climbed the near-vertical face of Mount Cleveland in January . Notably , it completed the 1,500-metre technical climb -- which would have taken experienced alpinists the better part of a day -- in a heart-bursting 90 minutes . <p> Their strength is off the chart , capable of crushing bones grizzlies have given up on , and tearing apart solid logs in search of grubs . One was recorded taking down a full-grown ( although probably sick ) moose . <p> " They may just be the toughest animal in the world , " Douglas H. Chadwick says in his book The Wolverine Way . " When you weigh 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill , that is just plain badass . " <p> Robert Inman , a senior scientist with the Wildlife Conservation Society , puts it another way : " They 're 1,000 pounds of attitude in a 30-pound body . They 'll take on animals 10 times their size , and they thrive in places that push the limits of mammalian existence . " <p> It was long considered a solitary animal , but modern studies are revealing a complex social hierarchy . Parents often assume " joint custody " of their offspring , and long after weaning , youngsters spend time with both mom and dad , learning to hunt and scavenge within their protected territories . <p> Chadwick relates the story of a wolverine kit that perished during its first winter . Researchers later found the tiny body in a depression scraped from the ground , and covered with pieces of wood chewed from a nearby log . It was , in the words of the researcher , undoubtedly a wolverine burial site . <p> Preliminary research shows that wolverines are sensitive to encroachment in their territory . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding the effects of development on wolverines is a pressing need as Canada may represent the wolverine 's last , and only sustainable , hope . Populations in Sweden , Finland and Norway are a small fraction of what they once were , and poaching remains a serious problem in Russia and China . <p> Given their sparse populations and enormous ranges , survival outside protected areas is critical . Biologists have known for decades that parks alone -- small islands of protection -- are incapable of protecting species with a wide range . Instead , " connective corridors " and " co-existence " have become the new mantras of conservation . And highway overpasses -- like the one a wolverine scuttled across last week -- are a key strategy in mitigating fragmentation . <p> " Will this particular animal be back ? " Clevenger asks . " Of course , no one knows , but other species clearly demonstrated that once they found the structures , their usage became routine . Mothers crossed with their offspring , and so on . " <p> Clevenger goes further . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and caribou -- should be our focus when assessing the overall health of some ecosystems . They certainly may hold the key to our understanding of landscape fragmentation . " <p> But lost amid the complex science is the idea that wolverines offer far more than a utilitarian understanding of the dynamics of conservation . <p> Consider Chadwick 's poetic summation of these powerful animals : " If wolverines have a strategy , it 's this : Go hard , and high , and steep , and never back down , not even from the biggest grizzly , and least of all from a mountain . Climb everything : trees , cliffs , avalanche chutes , summits . Eat everybody : alive , dead , long-dead , moose , mouse , fox , frog , its still warm heart or frozen bones . Whatever wolverines do , they do undaunted . They live life as fiercely and relentlessly as it has ever been lived . "

@@4460236 <p> A man named Eli is fishing on a lake in Northwestern Ontario when his line snags on what turns out to be a submerged castle , constructed entirely of red pine . Thus begins Eye Lake , a richly imagined , briskly plotted and , unfortunately , somewhat flawed novel by Atikokan-born writer Tristan Hughes . <p> Any dedicated student of Northwestern Ontario 's history ( anyone ... ? ) would know that Hughes is here re-imagining the fantastical , albeit quite factual , story of White Otter Castle , a soaring three-story log house built single-handedly in 1915 by eccentric hermit Jimmy McOuat as a dowry for a lady whom he briefly met and corresponded with through letters . After completing it , McOuat waited years inside the castle for his bride who never came . He died soon after and was buried in the lakefront next to his grand achievement . <p> Eye Lake centres on a fictional town called Crooked River , and the narrative is unfurled by Eli O'Callaghan , lifetime resident and grandson of Clarence , founder of the town and constructor of the castle ( which in an imaginative twist on the real White Otter Castle is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created when another lake was drained to make way for an iron ore mine ) . The story he tells spans two time periods : Eli as a boy and Eli as a man in current day , and it soon becomes apparent that this is a novel about reconciliation with the past as much as it is about lost things : There are two ( actually three if you count the narrator 's brief disappearance ) instances concerning boys lost in the woods , the aforementioned sunken castle , a long-lost ancestor , a lost highway , a draining lake and a dwindling town . There lies a Housekeeping-like resonance to this kind of thematic focus , and Hughes maintains a nice connection between water , memory , wilderness and loss throughout . Ultimately , it 's the promise of discovery , of unearthing the book 's many finely wrought mysteries , that keeps these pages flipping nimbly towards their conclusion . <p> Early on we learn that Eli was born with his umbilical cord wrapped around his neck and suffered some degree of brain damage from oxygen deprivation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freshness of their narrator 's voice ( see Nomi Nickel of A Complicated Kindness for a dazzling example of this ) , and though he is at times charming , something about Eli is n't quite defined enough to fully captivate , perhaps because his intellectually limited perspective fails to attain full credibility . These limitations come and go seemingly at the author 's whim ; Eli grasps the complexity of certain situations , but curiously not others . His diction at times remains low , which often leads to the best turns of phrase -- " ... was n't much good at catching nothing " -- but elsewhere he relates long passages of complex speech from fellow characters summoned from memory , we must assume , and peppers his own descriptions with diction well beyond the reach of someone afflicted with even the slightest cognitive deficiency . These inconsistencies no doubt serve the purposes of the narrative , but not of the character , nor , consequently , the reader . <p> There are some well-observed flashes of particularly Northwestern Ontarian vernacular such as , " How 's she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for insect repellant ) , and there are many convincing , earthy snatches of dialogue among Crooked River 's ramshackle residents . While at times characters lapse , strangely , into American Western dialects : " I do n't reckon " or " We 'd sure be obliged if you could help us out . " And there is even a distinct Britishness that creeps into Eli 's voice : " Straight away I could see ... " or " How 'd you like to go proper fishing ? " or " And besides , it was getting on ... " perhaps attributable to Hughes ' time spent in Wales , which is somewhat jarring . <p> Yet there really is much to like about this book . Hughes does well at evoking the history and landscape of Crooked River : the inky lakes , the fireweed , the flies , the rock cuts , the blueberry patches , the jack pine and bulrushes are all rendered with a loving touch . He conjures a town teeming with resourceful , eccentric , zany , yet lovable characters , inhabiting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by things lost , buried , repressed , missing , forgotten , sunken , some of which are eventually unearthed , rediscovered , found , surfaced and remembered . <p> Overall , Eye Lake is a sturdy and on-the-whole compelling novel , ripe with luminous prose and well-sustained metaphor , a fine investigation of isolation , work , family , the Canadian pioneer spirit and the doomed communities that linger in opportunity 's wake . But it is Eli 's wobbly , ill-defined voice that prevents Eye Lake from achieving the true depth to which it so admirably aspires . <p> * Michael Christie is the author of The Beggar 's Garden , which was a finalist for this year 's Rogers Writers ' Trust Fiction Prize .

Lose all those good things that I 've been consuming for the previous month at all the Christmas parties , " says Jones , who managed to lose 10 pounds within the first few weeks of 2011 . <p> Did he succeed ? No , considering he gained all of the weight back by March . <p> Obstacles : " As I started to lose weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop burning as much energy , " says Jones , who admits that he did n't exercise as much as he should have .

He also cites studies that suggest exercise decreases appetite . Jones , a father of five , is taking a sabbatical from University of Manitoba in January . " I 'm chilling this coming year .

" <p> 2012 resolution : To take up skating . " I never learned to skate as a child , " says Asper , who wants to " embrace our lovely winter weather .

And I really like the skates I bought , " says Asper . " They 're all sharpened and ready to go . " <p> Advice she gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things like fitness and health being a long-term health commitment . Making resolutions that you have n't actually fully embraced as a complete change in your lifestyle are n't necessarily the best way to go .

" <p> Favourite New Year 's resolution experience : During a seminar the Odiatus attended , the creator of the Chicken Soup for the Soul book series urged the crowd to make a list of 100 life goals . " By goal 15 or 16 , you start struggling , " says Odiatu . " By the time you get to 50 you start being silly . After than you get the childlike stuff you 're no longer censoring .

" But , yeah , I think we can do it again this year . " <p> Part of Wiley 's initial concern about the team 's chances to make another solid drive for the Sutherland Cup was a shift in the makeup of the team .

" And he 's only gotten better at ti this year . As his confidence has grown with being a year older , his influence on the ice and in the room has increased as well .
