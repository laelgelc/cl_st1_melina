The commentary carried the authorship of " Ren Zhongping , " a well-known pseudonym for writers tasked with presenting the current consensus on political questions and policy matters to cadres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early political program will center on the " China Dream . " More importantly , it addresses what the central leadership believes that dream means . That 's a good sign , because up to now , there 's been a raging debate , with everyone from the armed forces ( in Chinese ) to various provinces ( in Chinese ) speaking their mind on the subject . No consensus means no policy . <p> The editorial notes that " the greatest dream of modern times is realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation , " and cites Xi 's statement that to achieve that goal would mean " to achieve national prosperity , revitalization of the nation and its people 's happiness . " <p> " Prosperity " and " happiness " are inoffensive enough code words for cadres . " Prosperity " continues the focus on economic growth , with a greater emphasis on the fair distribution of goods . " Happiness " hews to the notion that government programs should n't stop at building more infrastructure -- in other words , that social satisfaction should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But it 's the " revitalization " part of Xi 's plan as expressed in the editorial that contains the real difference in terms of how the new leadership plans to push . <p> One departure is the editorial 's emphasis on China 's " humiliation , " particularly at the hands of foreign powers . There 've been hints of the same theme of victimhood in other essays , but none expressed so directly and forcefully as it was here . Evidence of this attitude is visible in Beijing 's recent attacks on " arrogant " electronics maker Apple over alleged anti-Chinese discrimination in the Cupertino , Calif. company 's warranty policies and in the subsequent crowing in state-media after Apple CEO Tim Cook apologized earlier this week . <p> Another difference , related to the first , is the appeal made to nationalist sentiment . The editorial contends that China 's previous triumphs -- victories presented as produced by the Communist Party , in its alliance with the Chinese people -- were produced by " a unity of purpose . " <p> This strong patriotic tone aims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cadres to start moving away from the previous focus on stability and control , and to take local measures that inspire support for the new leadership 's initiatives . That way , the editorial notes , Chinese citizens can recognize that " personal fate is closely linked with the destiny of the nation . " <p> Xi and his supporters clearly see this refined notion of the China Dream as a powerful remedy for mounting disenchantment , both in the Party and in Chinese society . There 's a positive purpose being offered here -- something to strive towards -- instead of the same old admonitions . And it 's further evidence of a real break from the Chinese political tradition of a new leadership staying low and going slow . <p> But there are also political hazards ahead . <p> This is not a repackaging of " reform , " but a real jump into the unknown . That 's because Xi and his supporters are emphasizing an actual reawakening of the Chinese spirit . Either cadres and citizens will respond with energy , or they 'll remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temporary political campaign . Either way , Xi is risking his political capital by departing from the usual script . <p> Then there 's the courage that Xi and his followers are displaying with the China Dream . For Xi seems to be taking on his predecessors , implying that they did n't do a good enough job at building the national spirit . Otherwise , why would there be a need to call for " a great rejuvenation ? " <p> That bravery will embolden reformers in the Party ranks -- and it might enliven the populace . Even the political left in China should find the effort at mobilizing the masses admirable . And patriotism usually plays pretty well . <p> But efforts to summon political support from below can also backfire in China , when leaders promise action and hesitate , or expectations go unfulfilled . And it will not make Xi 's predecessors very happy to see their own legacies poked at . If those attacks escalate , they wo n't remain on the sidelines silent for much longer . <p> Redefining reform as something more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better way to think about national development is promising stuff . But the new leadership needs to be careful that the China Dream does n't also become a wake-up call for those who agree that China needs change -- just not the type that Xi and his comrades want . <p> Russell Leigh Moses is the Dean of Academics and Faculty at The Beijing Center for Chinese Studies . He is writing a book on the changing role of power in the Chinese political system . <h> Comments ( 5 of 27 ) <p> China 's " humiliation " is its own inability to confront and acknowledge the terrible legacy of Mao and the CCP which have killed millions of Chinese and turned modern China into a morally abbysmal polluted wasteland .

@@392231 <h> Rape Victim 's Mother Wins Labor Camp Lawsuit <p> A Chinese mother at the center of a closely-watched legal battle notched a victory on Monday , successfully suing local authorities who had sent her to a labor camp to stop her petitioning for greater punishment of the men who had raped her daughter . <p> The municipal re-education through labor commission in Yongzhou , a city in central China 's Hunan province , was ordered by the Hunan Provincial People 's High Court to pay Tang Hui 2,641 yuan ( $430 ) in compensation for mental distress and infringement of personal freedom , according to her lawyer and state media reports . <p> Agence France-Presse/Getty Images <p> Tang Hui sits next to her lawyer Xu Liping in the Hunan Provincial People 's High Court on Monday . <p> " Thanks to all of you , " Ms. Tang wrote on the Twitter-like Sina Weibo microblogging service after the decision was announced . <p> Advertisement <p> Ms. Tang , 40 , was sentenced to a year and a half in a Hunan labor camp in August 2012 for " seriously disturbing social order and exerting a negative impact on society " after she publicly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men found guilty the previous June of kidnapping and raping her daughter -- then 11 years old -- and forcing her into prostitution . The girl was kidnapped in October 2006 and rescued on Dec. 30 that same year . <p> Two of the perpetrators were sentenced to death , four to life in prison and one to 15 years in prison . <p> News that the mother had been sent to a labor camp sparked nationwide outrage , and she was released after just eight days . After authorities rejected her demands for compensation for the time she spent in the camp , she sued them in local court , but lost after a one-day hearing . Monday 's decision was the result of an appeal . <p> While granting her compensation , the higher court denied Ms. Tang 's request for a formal written apology from authorities , her lawyer Xi Liping told China Real Time on Monday . The court said a verbal apology delivered in court by the head of the local re-education through labor commission should be sufficient , according to Mr. Xu . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's result gave Ms. Tang a chance to put the experience behind her .

In January , around the time Ms. Tang filed her original lawsuit , Beijing announced that the system would be " halted , " though many of the camps remain in operation . <p> Observers were divided Monday on the significance of Ms. Tang 's victory . <p> Given a court system dominated by the Communist Party that is widely seen as the instrument of political elites , many saw Ms. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hui defeating trumped up charges after such a perilous experience is a victory for rule of law in China , " well-known writer Li Mingsheng said on Sina Weibo . " More , it 's a victory for the rights of regular citizens !

Still , he wrote , " these cases promote an unyielding spirit . In today 's China , this is especially important . " <p> But in a country where face is often at least as important as money , many saw the absence of a written apology as a defeat for Ms. Tang , who had earlier rejected a mediated settlement because she wanted authorities to be held publicly accountable . According to Mr. Xu , the local government had offered her 100,000 yuan in " subsidies " to drop the lawsuit but she rejected the offer because it was contingent on confidentiality . <p> " She won compensation , but she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " argued newspaper columnist and social commentator Yao Bo , who writes under the pen name Wuyue Sanren .
