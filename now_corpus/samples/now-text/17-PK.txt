She tweets @hinaparvezvutt <p> The fact that women are increasingly joining the workforce is a source of satisfaction for many who have been advocating women empowerment for long . There is no denying that the trends in the society have changed considerably in the favour of women . Today women are not only accepted in as diverse fields as military or sports , but their achievements are also being celebrated . The last decade alone has seen the first women fighter pilot as well as a girls ' soccer team , both of which would have seemed a bit farfetched propositions in not so distant past . While all this is extremely attractive one must also take stock of the continued and persistent challenges that are still faced by many of our sisters and daughters as they try to play their rightful role in the growth and development of our country . <p> Arguably the biggest challenge with regard to women empowerment in our country is the longitudinal distribution of opportunities .

And even those who , by some stroke of good fortune , get these chances find out later that their family , as well as the society , has invariably attached some conditions to their working . <p> The definition of proper behaviour haunts every woman alike , whether she is a housewife or an economically independent individual . It is shocking but true . We are still far from realising that all efforts towards empowering women will remain futile if we do not change our attitudes towards the ' roles ' that we think women ought to play within their homes and outside . <p> To ensure that women get the fair chance to excel we will also have to fight the perception that is still very much prevalent in our society that women who work are doing it at the cost of their God-given and socially-endorsed duty to serve their families . We need to help the domestically challenged working woman . <p> Although we have accepted that women need to get professional degrees we still have to make our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carriers like men .

Imagine for a moment the standards of a society that a few years later judges these remarkably accomplished ladies by the roundness of their Rotes . And this is not a rhetorical exposition ; the percentage of lady doctors opting not to practice is alarming . Sadly , it is true for other professions as well . <p> The primary reason why most of the girls opt for medicine instead of engineering as a profession is some archaic calculus in the mind of their families that starts to factor in the duties and responsibilities of the life after marriage .

It 's a pity that the country that chose a woman twice at its chief executive still thinks that outdoor jobs are something that a lady ought not to do . <p> Giving time to family is important and it must always come first but women alone should not be made scapegoat all the time .

Still in my early 20s , I perhaps , was lucky or privileged to be posted in Lahore as chief reporter of country 's premier news agency , Pakistan Press International ( PPI ) . Learning of his arrival , I motorcycled to a railway station , which still remains Pakistan 's biggest . I could say without mincing words that I was stunned by the mammoth crowd spilling over its platforms , youngsters hanging by the iron and steel girders of the roof overhead , and flowing well past the main building . Their chant and yells was beyond the wildest of my imagination , for to be honest , it was my first encounter with a genuine crowd puller . He had parted company with his mentor , the then President Ayub Khan who he called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mohtarma Fatima Jinnah , the revered sister of the Quaid-e-Azam . But all that was exhuberance . Later on Bhutto realized that the real world lay at his feet -- the popularity he had seen , made him mend his ways and he was altogether a different man . Having studied at Oxford and at the University of Southern California of Berkeley , belonging to an illustrious family from Larkana , coming from the former princely Indian State of Junagadh , he was from beginning a revolutionary , a firebrand speaker since student days , a quality which came into full play when he became the President and Chief Martial Law Administrator , and later as the 9th Prime Minister of Pakistan . Seeing the hero 's welcome , Bhutto , searching for destiny after leaving the government of Ayub Khan , first as petroleum , then as foreign minister , suddenly realized that he had tremendous following . After quitting the cabinet , he went around Europe , America , France especially , but then luck had something else in store for him . He was to shine as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , and outside world .

But a person , born on 5th January 1928 , shot to fame as foreign minister par excellence , when he left deep imprints on history , and before that drove his country into a different destination , signing the oil and gas agreement with former Soviet Union , and then as prime minister giving the country such marvelous projects as the Nuclear Plant , Steel Mill , Heavy Mechanical Complex of Taxila and Pakistan Machine Tool Factory near Landhi in Karachi . All these were basic industries , of fundamental nature , proving the basic tools for future economic development of a country , broken within less than 25 years of its founding in 1971 , but it was Bhutto whose indomitable spirit to fight and reverse the course of history , galvanized the nation into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been said about his role in denying power to the majority party of Awami League after the 1970 elections , and hankering for power even at the cost of country 's unity , but the way he rebuilt the spirit of the people , all his " sins " had to be written off . His efforts to turn Pakistan into an independent , and truly sovereign country , can not be denied even by the greatest of skeptic or strongest of his opponents . By uniting the Muslim World into a cohesive and united force , and making its leadership benefit from their oil wealth immensely to dictate terms to the countries dominating the world politics , then were all golden chapters of Islamic world history , and credit to Bhutto for arranging such a powerful platform as the Organisation of Islamic World ( although that was born before he took over reigns of the country , in fact during General Yahya Khan days ) , his convening of Islamic Summit at Lahore in February 1974 , could never be under-emphasised .

If Bilawal today takes arrogant but legitimate pride in claiming that his grandfather lives in the hearts and minds of the people , he is not wrong . Attempts to erase him from public memory by military dictator General Ziaul Haq by hanging him for a sin that he never committed , failed miserably . Years after he was forced to accept hangman 's noose , and courageously on 4th April 1979 , he still was worshipped in Arab World . Muslim envoys at United Nations , where he delivered fiery speeches , and even at different Arab capitals which this scribe had the opportunity to visit , leaders , intellectuals , and human right activists , wanted to know as to what was wrong with Pakistan , Why was he hanged . He was treated as a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of honour yet to come to any other Pakistani leaders ' way .

He was a real leader , and the title which he earned of Quaid-e-Awam , was a legitimate one . He fully deserved it . Pakistan becoming 7th Nuclear Power of the world and first in the Muslim world , was principally due to Bhutto . He initiated it as soon as Indira Gandhi tested atomic fission in 1974 .

In the 1990s , both the PML-N and the PPP ( after stabbing each other in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitutional Amendment and do away with Article 58(2) ( b ) that enabled the president to sack an elected government . Then came the 14th Constitutional Amendment , passed by parliament wherein the PML-N had a two-third majority . This castrated individual MPs who , unable to vote in accordance with their views and conscience , were further shackled by their party . <p> Consider this amendment in today 's context . Let 's assume that a majority of the PML-N MNAs are convinced that the Sharifs ' Panama explanation is a lie ( even if the court case does n't result in a conviction ) . There is nothing they can do to hold NS to account other than to resign from their seats to assuage the demands of their conscience . Even if NS was disqualified as an MNA and as PM , he would still be the party head and PML-N MNAs would still be beholden to him during the present term -- not to mention his absolute power to grant them a ticket for 2018 . <p> Fast-forward to the post-Musharraf era . All party heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our democracy -- will not be elevated to the level of a constitutional commitment under the 18th Amendment . So , political parties remain one-man shows . The ability of MPs to break away from the party line remains constricted by the law . And despite this , there is hardly any meaningful legislation that has n't been introduced as an ordinance and presented to parliament as fait accompli . Is n't legislation the raison d'etre of parliament 's existence ? <p> Article 140A of the constitution after the 18th Amendment mandates the provinces to establish local governments and " devolve political , administrative and financial responsibility and authority to the elected representatives " . It was the relentless prodding by the Supreme Court that caused the reluctant promulgation of local government laws across provinces , including Punjab . And just when local governments were finally coming to life , the PML-N has revived the retrograde commissionerate system through the Punjab Civil Administration Ordinance , 2016 . <p> None of the local government laws devolve political , administrative and financial authority to elected local governments . The rules framed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to claw back power instead of delegating it to the third-tier of government . But with the Punjab Civil Administration Ordinance , the PML-N is n't even being coy anymore . It has vested administrative and financial authority in the DC and commissioners who will lord over districts and divisions , while elected local governments will remain useless debating clubs . <p> The other development that suggests that the Sharifs of the 1990s are back with a bang is the recent change in the rules of business aimed at reducing statutory regulators to the status of attached departments of the government . In contrast to the gibberish uttered by key PML-N ministers to explain the move , NS was candid in a meeting with journalists who had accompanied him to Bosnia recently . He plainly said -- to explain why their wings needed to be clipped -- that regulators were meant to regulate the private sector ( only ) but had started regulating the government . <p> What impact do these developments -- with parliament being rendered irrelevant , local bodies being neutered and regulatory authorities being leashed -- have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pyramid ? Their control over the means of patronage and their ability to dispense it as they wish has been enhanced . Even if one chooses not to impute vile motives to the ruling regime , the most charitable explanation one can come up with is that the centralisation and monopolisation of state authority is driven by the need for efficient delivery prior to the 2018 elections . <p> Now , consider the argument in favour of democracy . As " power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely " , the best way to prevent the abuse of power is to distribute it widely and subject its exercise to institutional structures that neutralise the whims of individuals . In other words , efficiency and regimented orderliness are n't virtues claimed by democracy ; consensus-oriented decision-making , legitimacy , transparency and accountability are . So what can we do when the flag-bearers of democracy begin vying for perks that dictatorship offers ? <p> The Sharifs seems to be presenting a competing view of democracy that goes like this : The people of Pakistan have elected us to rule for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no restraint on how we exercise state power and distribute state largesse . After five years , people will have a right to choose again . If they like what we have done , they can vote for us . If they do n't , they can vote for someone else . This view projects democracy like a game of lotto where citizens gamble once every five years and then silently suck up the consequences . <p> This contradicts the notion of democracy envisaged from a rule of law perspective ie the constitution is the source of all state power , which it delegates to various institutions and tiers of government accompanied by a system of checks and balances . This view incorporates doctrines of limited power and trust -- that is , that public office-holders can only do what they are authorised to do by law . It is unlike citizens who can do whatever they are not prohibited from doing , and the power they exercise is not their own but that of the people to be exercised in their name and for their benefit . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centre , Punjab and Balochistan and had a real opportunity to build local governments in at least two provinces as an effective third-tier of government most relevant to ordinary people . Instead , it used all its power and the devices at its behest to sabotage the idea of the local government . The Punjab Civil Administration Ordinance will ensure that leading to the 2018 elections , districts are under the control of DCs , who themselves have no security of tenure and are kept on a tight leash by the CM 's office . <p> The PML-N had the power to appoint outstanding experts to serve regulatory bodies to help them provide effective oversight to all regulatees -- including public-sector companies , and appoint accomplished professionals on boards of these companies to help them function as profitable commercial entities . Instead of strengthening the functionality and autonomy of regulators -- and the vitality and potency of boards -- the PML-N regime has changed the rules to ensure the subservience of regulators and boards to the whims of babus reporting to the PM 's Office . <p> What explains the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals as opposed to working with and strengthening institutions ? Authoritarian ethos ? Desire to seek rent ? Or plain old laziness ? <p> Whatever the cause , the Sharifs continue to rely on control and the dispersal of patronage as a substitute for service delivery through institutions of democracy . This creates a perpetual need to monopolise power , a natural outcome of which is conflict with other state institutions . It appears that the time in power is fast erasing the what-not-to-do lessons of the 1990s . <p> Race to the bottom was posted in Opinion of TheNews International - https : //www.thenews.com.pk on January 07 , 2017 and was last updated on January 07 , 2017 .

@@16274269 <p> The famous actress , the only answer <p> I asked my son the final day score of the Melbourne Test and he said he did not tune in for what was to be a tame draw . When I quipped that given two hundred runs to chase this Pakistani team was quite capable of capitulating , he laughed it off . Lo and behold ! My heroes did not disappoint me because my estimation was not whimsical but based on their indifferent batting and bowling for quite some time , and not just during their twin tour of NZ and Australia , which calls for a major surgery in a sport once known for its exciting all-round performances in yester-years . Firstly , Pakistani bowlers do not have the capacity to bowl a reeling side twice in a row , besides being so unsure batting last that the side not only refuses to enforce a follow-on 90% of the times it is in a position to do so but falls like nine pins itself when forced to bat again and save the match . Another unique distinction of the team is that it gets rolled over even on placid surfaces against accurate bowling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adversaries on paper , seldom bowl to their field with their up and down stuff barring Aamir who has consistently focused on length and direction even though he seems to have lost a bit of nip he once possessed . Surprisingly , even Yasir Shah failed to maintain accuracy and variation , which must have disappointed his mentor Shane Warne . It was actually after Pakistan 's disastrous outing in the Asia Cup at the hands of Bangladesh , the minnows in the game who once upon a time Pakistan had itself propped , that overhauling of the entire set-up had become imminent . Granted that cricket has become so competitive today that there is little room for complacency and one can be surprised by teams once considered babes in the game . Granted also that in the shorter version it may not at times be your day , but there is a difference in going down fighting and rank capitulation which becomes evident when Pakistani batters form a bee line out and back to pavilion . Other sides always have players up front or in the middle order who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currently as they neither spring from a system nor have leadership to lead by example . It is also important these days that regardless of format tail must invariably wag which in Pakistan 's case only does occasionally . Good and timely news that Hafeez has been cleared of the latest stigma of suspect action applied against spinners in the game of cricket , mostly affecting the careers of Pakistanis including Saeed Ajmal who reigned supreme in world ranking and one fine morning was dethroned not by performance but by virtual manipulation in the Rules of the game by the ICC . Hafeez was called as soon as he started to be effective and became a dependable all-rounder for Pakistan . Mercifully after over a year of lay-off he is back available for selection . But barring this affliction by those who control the game in the ICC where Pakistan has little say , cricketing management within the Country is mainly to blame for ruining many careers . Ahmed Shehzad besides Hafeez , is another exciting young cricketer made victim of egotism instead of being harnessed with proper counselling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they are still current and before being told to leave so that new blood can be groomed in time to replace them . Misbah should have announced retirement as soon as he crossed Imran 's record of captaincy and instead of wearing a sheepish look in retracting from his retirement decision after the disastrous Kiwi-Kangaroo-land outing he should honour his word and call it a day at the end of the tour . But he must go anyway now with another whitewash awaiting the Pakistanis . Younis Khan despite a dismal twin tour performance redeemed some honour and saved himself embarrassment with the last Test unbeaten ton which makes it a perfect setting for him to say good bye with grace if he manages to cross ten Thousand runs landmark of which he was now at touching distance barely 34 runs away at close on 4th day of the Sydney Test , deadline for filing my piece . Also as the team struggles with openers it was time to commandeer Salman Butt and Hafeez back into the squad besides Kamran Akmal for different formats , and Fawad Alam to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form in domestic cricket , while recalling in-form Saeed Ajmal and a promising Asghar for spin variation , besides requiring reshuffle of skippers particularly for ODIs and Test formats.Although there is a new set of Selection Committee , coaches and Managers but a lot more needs to be done to throw up talented and gritty players with a strong heart and appropriate mindset . Inzemam as Chief Selector with a rehashed team reaped the contrived glory of the National team downing a depleted West Indies ranked 8th without their stars Chris Gayle , Phil Simmons , Darren Sami and Andre Russell on placid Dubai , Abu Dhabi and Sharjah tracks while struggling to draw with England in Tests . Pakistani batters suffer on lively pitches because they refuse to prepare and get used to such tracks at home against swing and pace . With an up and down standing in T20 and One-day formats Pakistan one reckons , had only accidentally and briefly climbed to top of ladder in Test cricket only to expose their real metal on green-top surfaces abroad . While fresh blood must be scouted out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fishing without a proper plan . Everything has been going wrong with political appointments as Chairman of Cricket Board rather than commandeering either proven career Administrators or big names in game , without having to name names . But naming positions if one must , the ageing Chairman must go because he failed to formulate a structure to support a systematic and unbiased spotting and grooming of talent , recruited a lot of Selectors , Managers , trainers and Coaches and persisted with skippers who were either wrong choices or had outlived their utility . In fact the entire Management ; some of the officials among them appearing to reserve their berths till death do they part , ought to have been sacked not only because they did not live up to the job but also because their appointment in the first place had been highly questionable .

This by no means is to suggest that corruption and ill-gotten wealth should be glossed over , but might one ask why no one was talking about the others named or not named in the leak ? In a country where there is not even an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stations are dreaded for blackmail and perjury and where the common man instead of giving a shut-up call to the opportunistic politicians continues to be used by the exploiters and die a thousand deaths every day , what else would you call a dysfunctional if not a failed State ; has the joke not gone too far ? On the flip side , the Pakistani nation was singing near-worship praises of General Raheel Sharif as their savoir until he made a graceful exit . He led Operation Zarb-i-Azab from the front and till his last day , kept pressing for implementation in letter and spirit of the National Action Plan unanimously tailored by the Civil and Military combine as he gave impetus to cleansing Karachi by backing the Rangers in their combing operations despite the political Government in Sindh dragging its feet .

For several years now including the tenure of the last PPP Government it has been a common official refrain that the back-bone of terrorism in the country has been broken .

The joke indeed has gone too far when after establishing beyond doubt that the Metropolitan city of Karachi in particular was infested with militant wings under the patronage of leading political parties of the Province , no suo-moto judicial notice nor any Federal Government action is taken after unearthing huge catches of arms from hideouts and buried sanctuaries of a known political party , not only that its current leadership goes unquestioned by the directionless media but also not interrogated frontally by the Agencies and banned from politics .

We shall continue to work with Patari for years to come and add to the greater music community of Pakistan and beyond .

@@16401232 <h> Email <p> IT is almost an age-defying act , but Mustansar Hussain Tarrar seems so helpless in the face of his legendary wanderlust that he just keeps doing it . He moved around the world on shoestring budgets in his younger days . He then moved to the famed Northern Areas and went right up to the K2 base camp . His travel accounts over the last few years also made sense as they were comfortable affairs to such cosy destinations as Russia , China , the United States , Australia , and Holland . Even his two-volume narrative of the Saudi cities of Makkah and Madina reflected he was moving with age . But Sindh ? <p> At an age when , in his own words , he has become " Baba Bagloos " -- with an ever-thinning mop of silken white hair on his head -- and , again in his own words , when he is just a breath away from eternity , the sandscape of Sindh is hardly an obvious choice . It is wanderlust pure and simple ; of the very Tarrarian variety . <p> It is good for the readers , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Starting off with Niklay Teri Talaash Mein ( Out In Your Search ) , Tarrar has captivated generations of readers over the last about half a century . In that first title , he never defined what or who was meant by " your " -- and he has never done that ever since -- but what we know for sure is that the " search " is still on , and that he is still " out " . Good for him . Great for his fans . <p> The extent to which Tarrar has explored Sindh is a bit more than even the average Sindhi would have done . How many , for instance , would explore a desolate Hindu temple in Kasbo village away from the relative civilised existence of Nangarparkar at the other end of the wilderness and vastness of Thar ? <h> Mustansar Hussain Tarrar spends a few days travelling across the sandscape and tells the tale with wit and perspective as only he can <p> Not many would even know that . Not many would even care to know that . But Tarar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back with colourful tales of even more colourful peacocks painting the town ( read , desert ) red in their own merry ways . Now that Tarrar has done that , it sounds like an obvious thing to do , for at least a native Sindhi . <p> Readers will find it particularly heart-warming that the travelogue , despite having been penned by a hardcore Punjabi , does not have even a remote touch of a condescending tone . There is nothing ' Big Brother ' about it . If anything , Tarrar is in awe , and he has expressed that more than once . <p> Even when he meets Deeda Dil , a local man who remains with him for almost the entirety of his sojourn , Tarrar is so impressed by the beauty of the name that he recalls how he wanted to name his daughter Bhag Bharee , but could not do that owing to pressure from all concerned , " because we in Punjab remain so embarrassed by our own language that we name our children after Arabic names unmindful of what they mean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slight jitter in this regard early on when he talks of traditional Sindhi headwear and finds it a bit dull and pedestrian compared to its counterparts in the Pakhtun and Punjabi areas , but Tarrar becomes philosophical before it gets too late and clears the air thus : " Perhaps they ( the Sindhis ) chose such headwear because unlike us ( the Punjabis ) they preferred to be down-to-earth than elitist . If they are happy with their look of the poor and the humble in this headwear , it can be nothing but their instinct and desire . " <p> But even this is a rarity in the narrative . He talks fondly of his old fascination with Sindhu , the historical name for the river Indus , and his description of the moment when his eyes first catch sight of the river flowing in Sindh is pretty moving . He talks in raving tones about the mosque at Kandiaro , the Faiz Mahal at Khairpur , and the sanctuary at Mehranon . <p> When it comes to the famed historical haveli of Mir Ghulam Hussain Talpur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he is lost for words . " Just do n't ask me for I have no words to express what it actually is , " he says and moves on to compare it with what he has seen elsewhere in his life . Every single time he finds it " a thousand times more impressive " than the objects on display in places like Florence and New York . It 's pretty much the same at the Kot Diji fort which , he says , puts in shade the ones in Lahore , Rohtas , Derawar , and Hunza . <p> But it is Mohenjo Daro that takes his breath away . It is a city about which he has written a wonderful short story , ' Dhund ke peechay shehr tha A city behind the fog ' and in which the lead character happens to be the Dancing Girl whom he named Sindhia , which , come to think of it , is a much more apt and poetic name than the statue 's historical name , Sambara . <p> But that story , by its very nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality , Tarrar stands bewitched in Mohenjo Daro . " I have been to many an archaeological site around the world . I have felt impressed and inspired by many , but roaming around alone in the streets of the Mound of the Dead , why is it that I feel that I belong ... I have been at some point in time a resident of this very city ... This is my city ... I am a man from Mohenjo Daro , " murmurs Tarrar in what appears to be nothing but soliloquy . <p> Other than places and people , a Tarrar travelogue is always dotted with observations that provide wonderful insight to the readers . From political banners hanging here , there , and everywhere to visible signs of corruption , negligence , and mismanagement , right down to the unique sense of religious coexistence in rural Sindh , the narrative covers just about everything . The Sindhi Sufi streak actually provides a running thread across the book and with it continue comparisons with similar trends in Punjab . <p> " Faqir Mushtaq 's place is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one 's belief system ... Right in the middle of everything , he talks openly in the language of Mansoor al-Hallaj and Sarmad and yet no one objects ... no one even imagines getting tough with him . Had he been in any village anywhere in Punjab , he would have been ' dispatched to hell ' long ago , for forbearance is not a Punjabi virtue , " writes Tarrar , and he is apparently talking of trends in today 's Punjab rather than a historical reality . <p> His feelings remain pretty much the same as he moves from Sachal Sarmast in Daraza Sharif to Lal Shahbaz Qalandar in Sehwan , and finally to Shah Latif Bhittai in Bhit Shah . Talking of Sufi saints and savants , Tarrar himself becomes a Sufi every now and then . His descriptions of the connection he feels with Sarmast and Bhittai and why he can not connect with Qalandar fall pretty much in that category and are worth having a look at . In fact , it is something worth pondering over as it reflects on society at large .

@@16479237 <h> The colder war <p> Petrodollars may be defined as the U.S. dollar earned from the sale of oil , or they may be simply defined as oil revenues denominated in U.S. dollars . Petrodollars accrued to oil-exporting nations depend on the sale price of oil as well as the volume being sold abroad , which is in turn dependent on oil production . Sooner or later , the overall demand and supply of oil around the globe determines an actual price for oil , regardless of any administered pricing system . If you have never heard of the petrodollar system before , it will not surprise me . It is certainly not a topic that makes its way out of Washington and Wall Street circles too often . The mainstream media rarely , if ever , discusses its inner workings and how it has motivated , and even guided America 's foreign policy in the Middle East for the last several decades . The American experience of the seventies and the eighties is no more than an art application of microeconomic tools to the pricing of oil in the world markets . <p> Let 's delve in history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is for today 's world . <p> The standard of living of all Americans can be traced the vast , oil rich deserts of Saudi Arabia . After the Arab crisis , with the help of oil embargoes OPEC basically tripled the price of oil to the western world and at that time America realised that they were vulnerable because , then , America was importing about 70% of all the oil that they consumed . In order to secure a reliable , foreign source of oil , US President Richard Nixon sent his Secretary of State and National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger to Saudi Arabia for a secret meeting . The result of this meeting was a powerful pact that still stands to this day : If Saudi Arabia , which at that time was and still is the largest producer of oil , will sell the oil in US Dollars , America will defend Saudi Arabia ( from its neighbours and especially Israel ) and make sure that the House of Sa'ud ( Al Sa'ud ) will remain in power . The Americans laid out their terms which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must agree to price all of their oil sales in US Dollars only . In other words , the Saudis were to refuse all other currencies except the USD as payment for their oil exports and ; <p> 2 ) The Saudis would be open to investing their surplus oil proceeds in U.S. debt securities . <p> As a direct result of this US-Saudi agreement all other oil-producing nations also adopted US Dollar as the de-facto medium of exchange . Demand for this system increased exponentially and soon it had a new name : the Petrodollar . President Richard M. Nixon and his globalist sidekick , Henry Kissinger had successfully bridged the gap between the failed Bretton Woods ( dollars for gold ) arrangement and the new petrodollar system . The global artificial demand for the US Dollar would not only remain intact , it would soar due to the increasing demand for oil around the world . From the perspective of an empire , this new " dollars for oil " system was much more preferred over the former " dollars for gold " system as its economic requirements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rigid gold standard , the US monetary base could now be grown at exponential rates . <p> For a layman 's understanding the currency of any country is basically as strong as the demand for it , just like anything else in the basic rule of demand and supply . Why is the petrodollar so important ? That 's because it causes the demand for US Dollar . This petrodollar system , or more simply known as an " oil for dollars " system , created an immediate artificial demand for U.S. dollars around the globe . And of course , as global oil demand increased , so did the demand for U.S. dollars . A lot of Americans do not realise that over 70% of all hundred dollar bills in the world are actually outside of the US -- that is , there are more $100 bills in Russia than there are in America . This stockpile of US Dollars in countries around the world is because the oil is bought and sold using the greenback . <p> Let 's assume if oil starts trading in non-petrodollars such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example China and Russia starts trading oil in Yuan and Ruble rather than US Dollars then that demand is n't there . This would have a massive impact on the life of an average American which is assumed to be more drastic than the Great Depression . <p> To date , anyone who has ever threatened the status of the Petrodollar has not fared well . Libyan strongman Muammar Qaddafi publicly pushed for a pan-African , gold-backed currency that he would trade for Libya 's oil . He was killed in a US-backed revolution in 2011 and just a few short years before Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein advocated selling oil for Euros soon led to US invasion of Iraq under the guise of looking for Weapons of Mass Destruction . Interestingly enough , after the Americans invaded Iraq and took over the control of their government , the whole concept of selling oil in Euros never surfaced again . <p> Today , many countries resent the current petrodollar system and their leading spokesperson is none other than Russian President , Vladimir Putin . There is a new Cold War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cold war , the petrodollar age imposed predictability on the world . It would be absurd to lament its passing but just as unwise to ignore the consequences . We may discover soon enough that $50 oil comes with another type of price . The petrodollar is so crucial to the colder war . The only thing thing that is arguably , holding America right now at the top , is the petrodollar.

Barely had the auto show kicked off when the Justice Department announced that VW had pleaded guilty to criminal and civil charges related to its efforts to cheat on U.S. emissions standards . <p> The company agreed to pay $4.3 billion in penalties , the largest fine ever levied by the U.S. government on an auto company , dwarfing both Toyota 's $1.2-billion settlement for vehicle-safety problems involving unintended acceleration and GM 's **27;497;TOOLONG settlement for ignition-switch defects . This new penalty was on top of the $14.7-billion settlement that VW signed , in July , to cover customers ' class-action suits . In addition , six Volkswagen executives have been charged with running a decade-long scheme to rig VW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear to satisfy U.S. emission standards when they were actually spewing more pollutants than allowed , and then to hide their actions from regulators . The executives who were charged headed up engine development , quality control , and regulatory affairs . Oliver Schmidt , who led emissions compliance in the U.S. , was taken into custody in Miami , earlier this month ; the other five are said to be in Germany , where they likely must remain in order to avoid arrest . <p> The case stems from a strategic shift at VW in 2007 , when Martin Winterkorn , who was then the C.E.O. , implemented an aggressive growth directive meant to push Volkswagen past General Motors and Toyota as the leader in global auto sales by 2018 . This would be accomplished , in part , by selling many more so-called clean-diesel vehicles , which at the time were believed to deliver better fuel economy than gasoline with lower emissions and high performance . The company saw its biggest clean-diesel opportunity in the large U.S. market , where it had minimal penetration at the time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their diesel engines would not meet U.S. air-quality standards and that the cars would likely be barred from the market , they created a workaround in the form of software programmed to reduce emissions only when the vehicle was undergoing a standard U.S. emissions test . When on the open road , the car would perform normally-that is , it would emit more pollution but perform better in other respects . <p> Much of the government 's evidence came from the testimony of James Robert Liang-a VW engine designer who helped write the software fix and pleaded guilty , in September , to conspiring to defraud regulators-as well as from internal documents and memos turned over by Volkswagen . On the face of it , the e-mails and descriptions of interactions among VW executives that prosecutors have released so far are pretty damning . In one example , according to the complaint , in May , 2014 , a VW employee included Schmidt , the compliance officer , on a group e-mail saying that the Environmental Protection Agency had apparently found out about the emissions problems . Schmidt 's response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to the point : " Are you crazy ? Recall the email . " <p> Although the six co-conspirators are upper-tier managers , none is on VW 's board , leading to objections that the company 's top executives are walking away unscathed . However , U.S. prosecutors have said that more indictments are possible as additional evidence is unearthed , and German legislators plan to question Winterkorn , who resigned soon after the scandal came to light . German prosecutors also have a separate investigation under way into the automaker 's activities . <p> Only about five years ago , Volkswagen was poised to sit atop the global auto market . Although VW is still neck and neck with Toyota in worldwide sales-buoyed largely by its continuing strong presence in China-by most important metrics the automaker is fading . At this point , VW is barely breaking even , and the company 's profit per car is about eight hundred dollars , half what Toyota or Ford earn . Its U.S. growth strategy has been upended by the diesel scandal . Volkswagen 's U.S. sales fell 7.6 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , about where they were in 2011 . <p> Beyond the effect on the company itself , the VW episode is also noteworthy because it reflects a meaningful shift in the way that the Justice Department treats white-collar crime , in light of its widely criticized failure to discipline financial-services executives whose companies contributed to the collapse of the housing and credit markets in 2008 . The new approach was put forward by Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates , on September 9 , 2015 , in what has become known as the Yates Memo . In that document , she laid out a fresh set of rules for handling investigations into corporate misdeeds-and specifically for punishing managers who had their hands in their company 's criminal activities . <p> The core of the Yates directive is that , from the start , all civil and criminal inquiries must focus on individuals as well as corporations . Companies under investigation must identify all individuals involved in wrongdoing and provide evidence to help the prosecutor 's case . If they do not , they are refused credit for co ? peration-which usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shorter period under the eye of a government monitor . In a speech , Yates compared the way that corporations should be dealt with to the procedures used in drug prosecutions : if a drug trafficker " has information about the cartel boss and declines to share it , we rip up his co ? peration agreement and he serves his full sentence . " <p> Some corporate attorneys immediately took issue with the Yates Memo , arguing that it would deter companies from co ? perating with investigators out of fear that they may spend millions on an internal investigation and still fail to satisfy the Justice Department . <p> But Linda Hoffa , who was the Criminal Division chief at the Philadelphia U.S. Attorney 's Office and now represents white-collar clients , at the law firm Dilworth Paxson , told me that the Yates Memo has accomplished precisely what it set out to do . She pointed to the VW indictments as a direct result of policies to get tough on executives with the help of corporate co ? peration . She noted how unusual this was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the early two-thousands , when executives at Enron , WorldCom , Tyco , Adelphia , and HealthSouth were charged with a variety of misdeeds . From her experience on the white-collar side , Hoffa observed that " companies do n't want to go to trial , so they will co ? perate to the extent that they have to . If you make the bar high , they 'll work harder to meet it and avoid a big penalty ; if you 're lenient , they 're happy to go that way . " <p> Two days after the VW case broke , the Yates effect was felt again , when Japan 's Takata Corporation pleaded guilty to criminal wrongdoing involving faulty air-bag inflators that have been linked to at least sixteen deaths around the world . Three Takata executives were indicted on charges of wire fraud and conspiracy , while the company will pay a billion dollars to compensate automakers and victims . Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have pressed the Obama Justice Department to investigate senior executives at Wells Fargo , too , looking into complicity in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' names , in order to meet sales targets . Whether or not that happens will occur after Yates has left the Justice Department , this week . Yates has said that she believes the Trump Administration will maintain the policies she put in place , and that there are " a significant number of corporate investigations " under way that have yet to be resolved . At his confirmation hearings , last week , Jeff Sessions , who will likely serve as Attorney General under Donald Trump , indicated that he supported disciplining executives for corporate crimes , saying that " sometimes it seems to me . . . that the corporate officers who caused a problem should be subjected to more severe punishment than stockholders of the company who did n't know anything about it . " Now Sessions will have the chance to rectify that imbalance .

Touring the Carrier plant subsequently , he warned other US firms that he would impose stiff tariffs on them if they moved plants overseas and shipped products back home . <p> His Twitter account has produced a stream of commentary in the same vein . He has taken credit for Ford 's decision keep a Lincoln plant in Kentucky rather than move it to Mexico . He has threatened General Motors with import tariffs if it continues to import Chevrolet Cruzes from Mexico instead of making them in the US . <p> Trump has also hounded defense contractors for cost overruns , berating aerospace giants Boeing and Lockheed Martin on separate occasions for producing planes that are too expensive . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his predecessors . It is highly personalized and temperamental . It relies on threats and bullying . It is prone to boasting , exaggeration , and lies about actual successes .

Public officials are supposed to insulate themselves from private firms , lest they should be corrupted and engage in favoritism . This is a prized principle in the US , but one that is more often breached than observed . An obvious example is the undeniable influence over US government policy exercised by finance moguls during the last three decades . <p> Yet close business-government interactions also lie behind many of America 's successes . The history of US economic development is one of pragmatic partnerships and collaboration between the public and private sectors , rather than arm's-length relationships and rigid rules . <p> As historically minded economists and policy analysts such as Michael Lind , Stephen Cohen and Brad DeLong have reminded us , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal government provides investment , infrastructure , finance and other support that private enterprise needs . <p> US technological innovation owes as much to specific government programs , such as loan assistance or government purchases , as it does to American entrepreneurs ' and inventors ' ingenuity . <p> As Harvard Business School Professor Josh Lerner notes , some of the most dynamic technology companies in the US , including Apple and Intel , received financial support from the government before going public . Electric carmaker Tesla was a beneficiary of the same public loan guarantee program as Solyndra , the solar cell company that went bust in 2011 in a spectacular public collapse . <p> As the Solyndra example illustrates , many public initiatives fail . However , the ultimate test is whether the social return on the portfolio as a whole is positive , taking successes together with the flops . Such broad evaluations tend to be rare , but one analysis found that US programs to boost energy efficiency had produced positive net benefits . Interestingly , the bulk of the benefits were attributable to three relatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have provided perhaps the best analysis of the US " developmental state , " a reality they say the reigning market-fundamentalist ideology has obscured . <p> Block and Keller describe how a " decentralized network of publicly funded laboratories " and an " alphabet soup " of financing initiatives , such as the Small Business Innovation Research ( SBIR ) program , work with private firms and help them commercialize their products . <p> They and their colleagues have documented the extensive role of both federal and state governments in supporting the collaborative networks on which innovation rests , whether in biotech , green technologies or nanotech . <p> Such industrial policies , based on close collaboration and coordination between the public and private sectors , have been the hallmark of East Asian economic policymaking .

Previously growth forecast for Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) of Pakistan was at 5 per cent for FY 2017 and 5.4 per cent for FY 2018 . The report states that the improvement is based on a combination of low commodity prices , rising infrastructure spending , and reforms that lifted domestic demand and improved the business climate . It is forecast that growth will increase from 5.5 per cent in FY 2018 to 5.8 per cent in FY 2019-20 , with improvements in agriculture , infrastructure , energy , and external demand . <p> It is further stated that the successful conclusion of Special Drawing Rights ( SDR ) of US $4.393 Billion International Monetary Fund 's Extended Fund Facility ( EFF ) programme , was aimed at supporting reforms and reducing fiscal and external sector vulnerabilities , and it helped lift consumer and investor confidence .

With an estimated GDP growth 5.3 per cent it is also placed as the world 's fifth fastest-growing economy , only behind India ( 7.5% ) , Vietnam ( 6.6% ) , and China ( 6.4% ) , and Philippines ( 6.4% ) . The Economist forecast is given further credence by a Harvard University study , which had predicted that Pakistan economy would grow in excess of 5 per cent in the next decade and the Bloomberg report which ranked the Pakistan Stock Exchange as the 5th best performing stock market in 2016 . <p> These are heartening statistics for a country that is continually maligned on multiple fronts in the face of sectarian threats , political instability , and on economic indicators such as : a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remittances ; almost negligible Foreign Direct Investment ; and , FX reserves being built up through excessive borrowings . There have been serious reservations expressed over the issues of management and governance as well as transparency over the CPEC investments . Recently , some quarters have also expressed serious concerns about the mortgaging of National Assets , such as Motorways , Airports , and Broadcasting stations , to acquire additional debt . Panama-gate continues to be a sore point and one that has become more of a media circus than an actual trial with far-reaching reputational implications internationally for the country . Yet , despite all these issues Pakistan appears to be on a robust path of progress and growth based on the strong endorsements by the International organisations . <p> It needs to be understood that Economists and Forecasters are human , and make predictions based on factors , which often prove to be unpredictable . They can be wrong , as was Ben Bernanke when he made a prediction in 2007 that the United States would not head into a recession and that the stock exchange and housing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his predictions were proved abysmally wrong due to an unexpected external shock and the US economy faced one of its most serious crisis post the 1930 's Great Depression . It is therefore important to evaluate the ground economic realities in Pakistan . <p> The Pakistan Stock Exchange continues to touch new heights after the Chinese acquisition of the 40% stake valued at US $85 Million , and is currently hovering around the unprecedented level of 50,000 . Truly , this is a remarkable achievement and one that has put it amongst the top performing indices in 2016 . While short term speculative euphoria and manipulation can fuel growth , long-term-sustainable growth is based on actual performance of the underlying stocks . That will depend on the performance of the listed companies . There have been scenarios in the past when ' bubbles ' were built up followed by long periods of depressed prices . <p> The Foreign Exchange Reserves have been built up to a level of US $23 Billion plus . This too is a remarkable achievement , though it is strongly believed that the bulk of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwindling inflows and high outflows . The issue of the mortgage of national assets for this purpose is now being brought into focus as is the issue of rising outflows for imports , profit repatriation , and maturing loan and interest repayments . All these factors are expected to place additional pressure on the reserves in the absence of viable revenue generating opportunities . <p> The Retail sector is an important gauge and strong retail sales have a direct impact on a country 's GDP . In Pakistan the Automobile sector has shown robust results , particularly the motor-cycle industry , which has exhibited growth of 10 per cent per annum . Sectors allied to the wedding industry remain strong with an incessant rise in expenditures . Textile and made-up garments , home accessories , construction material , and restaurants appear to be doing well with strong internal demand . It is difficult to estimate the retail sector contribution with accuracy due to the fact that this is mostly a cash based sector with undocumented transactions . <p> The Real Estate market received a temporary set-back after the proposed reforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sector and restore confidence . The sector has gone through a rationalisation phase and should come out stronger in the longer run . <p> New business startups are an important contributor to the economy and in Pakistan there appears to be a focus on small businesses in the absence of larger investments . The emergence of the small scale enterprises is critical for growth and organisations such as LUMS are playing an important role in identifying new opportunities through their incubator programme . This is a welcome sign as this creates employment opportunities and provides a growth impetus for the economy . <p> GDP growth in the economy is mainly a result of depressed commodity prices and non-revenue generating infrastructure projects in the absence of genuine industrial growth . While the CPEC initiative is expected to have a positive impact with the establishment of Industrial and Trade zones , there is an apprehension that the Chinese firms would set up industries and warehouses and Pakistan would lose out . The falling exports point to a declining manufacturing sector , however , the recent Textile Package of Rs.180 Billion should boost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a result of the ongoing infrastructure construction projects with cement and allied industries making bumper profits and expanding facilities . GDP has been called a flawed indicator of growth , as programmes such as excessive government spending can be a contributory factor for creating a ' false ' sense of growth . <p> Pakistan 's unemployment rate estimated at around 6 per cent is not particularly worrisome . However , there is a high element of ender-employment which is leading to lower productivity and lower earnings . It has been estimated by the Government of Pakistan that almost 60% of the population is below the poverty line . This is an extremely worrisome issue , when combined with the low levels of education and high population growth rates in the country . It can actually prove to be a severe drag on economic growth in the long term . <p> The Consumer Price Index in Pakistan ( CPI General ) increased by 3.7% on year-on-year basis in December 2016 as compared to an increase of 3.8% in the previous month and 3.2% in December 2015 .

On a MoM basis , it increased by 0.1% in December 2016 as compared to increase of 0.2% in previous month , and an increase of 0.2% in corresponding month of last year i.e. December 2015 . With a low interest rate environment and depressed commodity prices inflation has been contained , but has the potential of rising in the future with a rise in interest rates and commodity prices .

Move production to the US but make less money . <p> " I do n't think the auto industry would turn up its feet and die , but it would be a terrible shock . It would create mayhem with their profitability , " said Marina Whitman , a business professor at the University of Michigan and a former vice president at General Motors Co . Trump will be hosting a breakfast meeting Tuesday with the heads of General Motors , Ford Motor Co. and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles . On Monday he reiterated his warning to impose a " substantial border tax " on companies that move their manufacturing out of the United States . He also promised tax advantages to companies that produce products domestically . <p> For more than two decades , Mexico has been an oasis for the auto industry , offering cheap labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whitman says Detroit automakers ca n't build small cars profitably in the US , where a unionized auto worker can make $58 an hour in wages and benefits . By comparison , a Mexican auto assembly worker makes a little more than $8 . That helps to explain why automakers have announced $24 billion in Mexican investments over the last six years , according to the Center for Automotive Research , a Michigan think tank . In all , $50.5 billion in vehicles and $51 billion in auto parts were shipped to the US from Mexico in 2015 , US government data show . <p> Mexico 's auto sector , while still smaller than the US , is growing at a faster clip . Mexico 's vehicle production capacity is expected to rise 49 percent to 5.5 million vehicles by 2023 , according to LMC Automotive , a forecasting firm . US capacity will grow 13 percent to 14.2 million vehicles in the same period . But Trump could change that . In frequent tweets targeting the auto industry , he has proposed both a 35-percent tariff on Mexican-made imports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies ' imports . That 's forcing automakers to consider a number of options . <p> Abandoning Mexico and moving production to the US , as Trump demands , would cost the industry billions and scuttle plans that are years in the making .

" It 's very difficult to turn on your heels quickly in the auto industry , " said Laurie Harbour-Felax , a manufacturing consultant and president of Harbour Results Inc . <p> In recent weeks , Volkswagen , GM , Toyota and BMW have all said they wo n't shift their production plans , while stressing the amount they 've invested in the US BMW , for example , said it 's proceeding with a $1 billion plant in Mexico that will make the 3 Series sedan starting in 2019 .

Volkswagen , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US from Mexico , according to LMC . But Honda imports just 11 percent , and that 's expected to fall this year after it moves production of the CR-V SUV from Mexico to Indiana . In early January , Ford made the surprise announcement that it would halt construction of a $1.6 billion plant in Mexico slated to build the compact Focus . It also announced plans to invest $700 million of that savings into a Michigan plant where it will make new electric and autonomous cars . <p> Ford said declining sales of small cars , not Trump , influenced the Mexico plant decision , and the company will still make the Focus in Mexico at a different plant . But Ford CEO Mark Fields noted that Trump 's promise to lower corporate taxes and ease regulations would make it more attractive to do business in the US Fields also said he 's not worried about the possibility of tariffs .

" <p> Trump ca n't place tariffs on companies or groups of companies without congressional approval , says Gary Hufbauer , a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Peterson Institute for International Economics . But he could fashion tariffs that hurt some companies more than others by , for example , picking and choosing from the dozens of import classifications for vehicles and parts . Automakers could stop selling some Mexican-made cars in the US altogether , but that would cost them customers . They could also try to sell the cars elsewhere . Mexico has free trade agreements covering 45 countries , including agreements with the European Union , Japan and South America . By comparison , the US has agreements with 20 countries . <p> Nissan Motor Co. , the biggest producer in Mexico , made more than 823,000 vehicles in the country in 2015 .

@@16796231 <h> Email <p> THE subject of income inequality , once pushed to the margins of economics by more attractive offerings such as economic growth , has experienced a spectacular turnaround . <p> This is especially true in the aftermath of financial crises and movements like Wall Street vs Main Street , which brought to the fore the staggering gap in the incomes of the rich and poor . A few years ago , pathbreaking work by French economist Thomas Piketty in his Capital in the 21st Century gave further vent to the problem of increasing inequalities in income across the globe . <p> A new paper by three renowned economists confirms this trend in the US . Thomas Piketty , Gabriel Zucman and Emanuel Saez calculated the share of income going to different groups . Not surprisingly , they found that since the 1970s , income inequalities has exacerbated with no signs of reversing . While the income of the middle and poor class has tended to stagnate , that of the rich has climbed precipitously . At present , the bottom half of the US population is earning only 12 per cent of the total income generated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> How can a government tackle inequality ? <p> But there is something different about this paper that makes people notice . It 's an issue that forms one of the central questions of economic policymaking : redistribution of resources . In their research , the three economists factored in the government transfers over time under various redistribution schemes . Did it help stem the tide in favour of the rich ? The answer , as per this research , is no . <p> This assumes critical importance when one considers that the US redistributes a staggering $5 trillion under its various resource redistribution initiatives . But years of trillions of dollars of efforts to redistribute income to people in the lower-earning brackets have barely made a difference , and the bottom 50pc of the working-age population 's income has barely budged since at least the 1970s . <p> To rephrase , the $5tr being spent by the government constitutes a waste since it 's not having the intended effect . A book by Walter Scheidel will ignite this debate further . Scheidel is a professor of history at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) takes a historical look at the problem of inequality . From ancient Greece to the modern 21st-century welfare states , governments have tried their best to create equal societies through resource redistribution . His worrying thesis , though , is that efforts at lasting and substantial reductions in income inequality through redistribution are bound to fail . <p> Scouring through the historical record , Scheidel found that economic development has always led to deepening of entrenched income inequalities . The policies to reverse that trend did not make much difference . Notice that Scheidel 's findings are somewhat similar to that of Piketty , who in his book found the same pattern of entrenched income inequalities in favour of the rich . These , and other such findings , also tend to discredit the long-held belief of ' trickle-down ' economics , which proposed rising inequalities in earlier stages of growth but an equalling of incomes in the later stages . <p> So , what are we to think about redistribution policies ? As far as Scheidel is concerned , if policymakers are looking for drastic resetting of wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events like war , violence and plagues . He cites various instances to prove his point . <p> For example , the demise of the Roman Empire in the fifth century and the Plague of Justinian led to drastic changes in wealth and income . Italian city states such as Florence and Genoa , in the Middle Ages , exhibited extreme wealth inequalities in favour of a select few families . But the onset of the destructive bubonic plague ( the ' black death ' ) that ravaged Europe drastically reset wealth concentration , leading to more equal societies . The French Revolution represents another such episode . <p> Piketty also pointed out the First and the Second World Wars as occasions when wealth distribution and income inequalities were substantially reset . But surely , any sane person would dread to take this route . Which leaves us with the possibility of only marginal improvements through redistribution , something that is hardly worth the effort relative to massive expenditure of state resources . <p> So , what can a government do ? One probable answer comes from Lawrence Katz , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early intervention in terms of events that lead to skewed wealth distribution . For example , earnings through financial innovation are one area where early intervention could have made a difference . Thus , one can argue that it is imperative that the government create a level playing field for all rather than redistribute on its own . 
@@16796234 <h> Email <p> THERE is a feeling in Sindh -- particularly in its urban areas -- that the provincial government has encroached upon the duties of the elected local bodies , rendering them powerless . This position is most forcefully argued by the MQM-Pakistan . However , the PPP-led government feels the local bodies have enough powers and funds , and should get on with the business of running civic affairs . On Sunday , former Karachi mayor and head of the Pak Sarzameen Party Mustafa Kamal weighed into the debate , essentially backing the stance of his old party and demanding full powers for the metropolis 's mayoralty . Criticising the PPP 's provincial set-up , he remarked that cleaning storm drains and picking up the city 's rubbish was not the chief minister 's job . Some Sindh-based PPP leaders have defended the current LG law in the province , saying that the Musharraf-era law -- under which Karachi and other urban areas saw considerable development -- was designed by the dictator to bypass the provincial administration .

These are matters best dealt with at the local level . The result of the provincial bureaucracy 's management of Karachi 's civic affairs is clear for all to see : the city has become a huge dump reeking of putrid waste and foul-smelling sewage , with broken roads resembling a war zone . By all means , the provincial government should maintain checks and balances on local bodies . But Mr Kamal is spot on when he says that full powers must be granted to municipal bodies in Karachi , as well as the rest of Sindh.

@@16825233 <h> 6 scary reasons your eyes could be acting weird <p> While it is important to be on the lookout for common eye conditions such as glaucoma , cataracts , and macular degeneration , your eyes may also tell you when things are seriously off elsewhere . <p> " Nothing in your body is in a box , " says Deborah Herrmann , M.D. , assistant professor of clinical ophthalmology and attending physician at Scheie Eye Institute at University of Pennsylvania 's Perelman School of Medicine . " Your eyes are connected to your central nervous system and everything else . Something that 's affecting your body can be affecting your eyes as well . " <p> Compiled from Women 's Health , here is a list of six freaky reasons your eyes could be acting up . <p> 1 . High cholesterol <p> " Someone with high cholesterol can have transient vision loss that comes and goes , like a curtain or shade coming and going over their eye , " says Herrmann . This is a sign your carotid artery is plugged with plaque and struggling to get blood to your eye . You may also have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( called an arcus senilis ) , or have trouble adjusting to bright light . In some cases , yellowish cholesterol deposits called xanthelasma can show up on your eyelids or in the corners of your eye socket . <p> Your thyroid is a butterfly-shaped organ in your neck , and it controls certain hormones that help control your growth and metabolism . If your thyroid is n't functioning properly it can lead to a host of problems , which sometimes includes swollen eye muscles and congested eye sockets that cause your eyes to bulge out and look bigger than usual , says Herrmann . You might also have double vision . <p> Graves ' disease , an autoimmune disorder that affects your thyroid , can make your eyelids retract , which can also make your eyes look bigger than usual . If your eyelids retract enough that you ca n't close your eye , you may develop dry eye , since your lids ca n't keep moisture in . <p> 3 . Diabetes <p> Regular eye exams are a good idea for anyone , but it 's a must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disease . " Diabetes can make the macula -- the part of the retina that controls your central vision -- swell or retain fluid or fluid , " says Herrmann . While you might not completely lose your vision , she says , you 'd definitely notice a change for the worse . People with diabetes are also 40% more likely to get glaucoma and 60% more likely to get cataracts , and they should be on the lookout for diabetic retinopathy -- a set of disorders that affect the light-sensitive part of your eye . Retinopathy can cause problems like blurry vision or even retinal detachment . <p> Sudden loss of sight is startling -- and for good reason . It could be a sign that you 're about to have a stroke , or that you 've already had one . Normally , vision loss from a stroke happens in one eye only , but it can happen in both , causing blindness . Sometimes strokes damage the nerves that move your eyes , which can make you see double . <p> Strange as it sounds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye only . This is called a retinal stroke , and it happens when blood vessels in your retina are clogged with plaque . You 're more likely to get a retinal stroke if you have high blood pressure or carotid artery disease . Any kind of stroke is serious and calls for immediate care , so call 911 if you suddenly go blind in one or both eyes . <p> 5 . Retinal migraines <p> Temporary blind spots in your vision could mean you 're having a migraine of the eye . This is n't the same as a headache-type migraine . Retinal migraines cause " blank spots " in your vision called scotomas . " The blind spots only last for a certain number of minutes , and you may or may not have pain , " says Herrmann . You may also see flashes of light , have blurry vision , or get a headache before or after your eye symptoms . If it happens repeatedly -- especially if it only impacts one eye -- see an eye doctor to get checked out . <p> 6 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sign of an autoimmune disorder called myasthenia gravis , which can cause muscle weakness that makes it hard to open your eyes all the way . Meanwhile , lupus and certain types of arthritis can lead to uveitis , an infection in the layer of your eye called the uvea . And eyesight changes are sometimes a clue that you should get screened for multiple sclerosis . " If you develop decreasing vision in one eye over the course of a few days or weeks and you have pain in or around one eye -- especially when you move it -- it could be your first presenting sign of MS , " says Herrmann.

I still think Malik has some couple of years left in Himachal and he should be handed over the ODI captaincy and Sarfaraz as vice captain so that he can be a successor of Malik after his retirement . <p> cricfan70527688 on February 9 , 2017 , 15:49 GMT <p> pakistan cricket will never come right as long as we have this old man shahryar khan holding the post of chairman . i am sure they gon na play azaha ali as a player though he does nt deserve a place at all but influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hafeez will be there as well so the only scapegoat will be asad shafiq and may be rizwan though the whole team except for amir sharjeel babar and imad needs to be changed . <p> SuryaTheFighter on February 9 , 2017 , 14:54 GMT <p> A sensible decision at the end .. play only test matches and take over captainship from Misbah .. <p> cricfan10044827 on February 9 , 2017 , 14:50 GMT <p> As a neutral Indian fan , I do n't think Azhar Ali warrants a place in ODI team as well . His strike rate should be complimentary to Sharjeel and then should picks up pace with other partners , not making them take undue risks . He should be kept as a Test specialist like Pujara and Vijay in Indian team . <p> SamRoy on February 9 , 2017 , 14:49 GMT <p> A strong Pakistan team is important for cricket to continue to thrive . And this decision is a step in the right direction . However , I am still worried about Pakistan test team after Misbah and Younis ' retirement . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who could take the middle order slots but Umar Akmal has lost most of his ability and now looks a very average ( sort of good-ish ) batsman who requires some 300% improvement to become world class . About Shehzad we have to wait and watch . Babar Azam is a good ODI batsmen but still has a lot to figure out as a test batsmen . Pakistan needs technically sound batting coach ideally from Pakistan in order to bridge the language barrier . Md . Yousuf should take up a few coaching courses and then take up job as Pakistan batting coach . Ideal man for the job . Either him or Saeed Anwar . Grant Flower is n't really helping . <p> Ashhar-Hasan on February 9 , 2017 , 14:13 GMT <p> Great decision by PCB , now we should n't expect sudden change . It will take time revamp the team . Azhar ali has no place in ODI team unless he improves his strike rate to 120+ . Sarfraz should be given free hand in team selection . <p> wnwn on February 9 , 2017 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ali in modern ODI cricket where 350 is a par score . <p> fkhawaja on February 9 , 2017 , 13:55 GMT <p> Now we can see what a bad decision it was to bring in Azhar who was not even in the ODI team and make him the captain . We waisted 2 years and who is responsible . It was the extreme lack of vision of mr sharyar and selectors for doing this . We should have selected someone who was a ODI specialist and could lead from the front.we need some aggressive batters to support sharjeel.so we must drop azhar and bring an attacking opener . <p> rajababu555 on February 9 , 2017 , 13:50 GMT <p> It will be good for Pakistan cricket team ... <p> cricfan98603889 on February 9 , 2017 , 13:45 GMT <p> happy that the pcb has ended their ' azhar ' experiment ... sad to see they will still experiment and include him in the one day squad , though the pcb chairman should not have said that - places are based on merit and not because of a deal he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he deserves a place in the shorter formats of the game ... just like he was n't part of the squad before he suddenly came out of the blue and was asked to lead the one day team ... i think he can be a good test player and maybe a good test captain if given a chance once misbah goes ... <p> cricfan88338273 on February 9 , 2017 , 13:41 GMT <p> I think Imad will be good choice for feature . <p> shahidmahmood on February 9 , 2017 , 13:40 GMT <p> @CricketChat Sarfraz 's form has n't really dipped too much . He 's averaged 54.67 in ODIs , 36.22 in Tests ( not great , but still decent ) , and 38.67 in T20Is with a S/R of 127 , since Jan 2016 . His keeping form has n't been great , but the second choice keeper ( Rizwan ) ca n't bat to save his life , let alone his place in the team . <p> #HellTrader on February 9 , 2017 , 13:32 GMT <p> Azhar Ali later also resigned from the vice captaincy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news on his official twitter account . Good move to have Sarfraz as captain in all three formats ! ! <p> cricfan82796067 on February 9 , 2017 , 13:27 GMT <p> Can he also quit ODI 's &amp; T20 cricket . There is no place for any one player in any team who has a strike rate of less than 90 in ODI 's and less then 120 in T20 's . <p> GULNATHANI on February 9 , 2017 , 13:12 GMT <p> I do agree that the style of Azhar is far from modern but to BCCP putting more pressure on him before an important series in Australia was mind boggling . Gulzar <p> CricketChat on February 9 , 2017 , 13:11 GMT <p> Sounds better than sacked . Azhar Ali does n't merit ODI selection if he is n't the captain . Every Pak fan has been clamoring for Sarfraz , whose batting form has clearly dipped in recent past , to be made skipper . Now that is a done deal , it is up to Sarfraz to lift the team from its pit now . Eager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9 , 2017 , 13:04 GMT <p> I thought it 's only Sri Lankan fans who needs a baby ( Dinesh Chandimal ) to captain their team instead of a well experienced consistent Angelo Mathews . <p> Azhar Ali should not have done that . This will be an extra burden on Sarfraz Ahmed <p> cricfan07449828 on February 9 , 2017 , 12:40 GMT <p> Yeah lets not all get lost by thinking sarfraz will be a great captain , if the standards of fitness and fielding improve under his leadership with the combination of a positive influence on team then we can expect results <p> cricfala on February 9 , 2017 , 12:17 GMT <p> Good decision by Azhar and PCB . If PCB appointed Sarfraz a new ODI captain , he should be backed and respected in his decisions , give Sarfraz a free hand to work with Inzi to make PAK cricket great again . Shoaib Malik should not even in the team , he should not allow a chance to create team differences again as he has been doing for long time . <p> ajithabey on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be an ideal choice with his experience and all round performances . <p> SHAHKY on February 9 , 2017 , 11:53 GMT <p> shoaib malik is was best chouce as odi captain ... wr r going to ruein now saefraz even as a good batsman ... mark my words ... malik is a good choice in my opinion .. as he belongs to a team who was fearless . he strated with waseem waqar saeed inzi ... shoaib akhter ... etc .. so his approach and mentle strength is diffrent than current players .. <p> Apurav Sood on February 9 , 2017 , 11:47 GMT <p> best of luck Pakistan team from India . Many Indian wants to see dominant Pakistan team . just read below somebody is thanking almighty god in below comments that he is removed . Haha <p> Khurram S Chaudhry on February 9 , 2017 , 11:44 GMT <p> What PCB should do is to make all probable young captaincy candidates captain of their domestic teams . thats how you get captains . Even in PSL , Misbah should play as mentor and also like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be followed in domestic events . Players like Imaad , Babar or other players which they feel can be captaincy material should have some experience at domestic level . <p> cricfan28857638 on February 9 , 2017 , 11:34 GMT <p> At last right decision . But too late . This is the difference between Pak and other countries . Should have done much earlier . Now Misbah ul Haq should go immedietely for a fresh start . The New Captain will have time to plan things till next series . Should groom atleast 3 good bowling alrounders like Abdur Razaq as the tail is too long and no one to up the tempo . <p> SANDEEP7282 on February 9 , 2017 , 11:34 GMT <p> Two wrongs does not make a right ! He was fine , I do n't think the results would have changed irrespective of who the captain is . If you have a slow horse , why change the jockey <p> Amran1000 on February 9 , 2017 , 11:33 GMT <p> Good move but now we need to fill the team with players who can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rizwan and lets have Fakhar Zaman in the middle order with Ahmed Shahzad opening with Sharjeel . <p> However , with Inzamam in charge who knows .. We will probably see Mohammed Yousuf recalled .. ! ; - ) <p> anver777 on February 9 , 2017 , 11:31 GMT <p> This was expected ! ! ! ideal time to make Sarfraz the captain in all three formats ... <p> sajjadparrey on February 9 , 2017 , 11:24 GMT <p> They should have selected someone in mid 20 's ( age ) with a long term goal . Remember Graeme Smith 's captaincy selection and how it turned out to be for South Africa . But it is Pakistan team so no such expectations . <p> zaidixx on February 9 , 2017 , 11:13 GMT <p> I think very wise desicion from azhar ali before psl , now pcb can again monitor sarfaraz in the psl as a captain of quetta !

Waiting for the news since 2015 CWC . <p> Nobesha on February 9 , 2017 , 11:04 GMT <p> Selection of Sarfarz as an ODI captain means that Kamran Akmal future is dark as he ca n't come back under his leadership .

Anyways Good Luck to sarfarz and team Pakistan <p> mebs on February 9 , 2017 , 11:04 GMT <p> This should have happened straight after the drubbing they received by the aussies .

Shoaib Malik is a good skipper he knows how to build his field placement no doubt Sarfraz Ahmad is a yoyo captain for our team but , Inexperienced and not to know conditions of other countries like Australia and england south Africa . Shoaib is experienced , diligent and master blaster man.1 question if ask anyone to me about Shoaib Malik i only give a simple word for him a skipper who played under captaincy of Wasim Akram , Waqar Younis , inzimam Ul Haq , Shahid Afridi , Salman butt , Misbah Ul Haq and noteworthy the legendary Younis Khan . You will give him a chance he will fight and quench the himself and his teammates in the field by piling runs and taking wickets . But , Sarfraz should not hurt .... <p> cricfan26044565 on February 9 , 2017 , 10:45 GMT <p> Safraz as captain makes it complicated . Which means he has to play so no way PAK can bring in another good wicket keeper batsman . Hafeez is a good captain <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Azhar never deserved a place in ODI team from the outset . Hopes PCB makes Sarfaraz the new captain . He has been captain of the U19 team that won the world cup and has also been the captain of Karachi in the domestic arena . Plus he has got the fighting spirit and the modern technique that Pakistan ODI team so desperately need at the moment . <p> fairfan70 on February 9 , 2017 , 10:27 GMT <p> Pakistan has to invest in Azhar Ali as the test captain ( assuming that Misbah and Younis will retire sooner than later ) and Sarfraz Ahmed as the ODI and T20 captain . Chopping and changing frequently will not help them nor their replacements . <p> cricfan01835720 on February 9 , 2017 , 10:25 GMT <p> It 's a poor side in Limited Overs Internationals be it 50 overs or T20Is .

@@16836239 <p> I never thought I would pen two consecutive pieces on Donald Trump , but this one is inspired more by Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Nafees Zakaria 's incessant efforts at trying to place Pakistan 's relations with Donald 's US in Donald 's world . <p> Pity poor David Hale , the US ambassador , who has an even bigger task of explaining his country under the new setup to the ever fragile Pakistani official make-up that determines its own health through American eyes . <p> It 's been a busy week for all with respect to US-Pakistan relations . Here 's how it goes . One morning , out of nowhere , Pakistan decided to detain and proscribe Hafiz Saeed , the head of Jamaatud Dawah ( to some the LeT ) . The action was taken under UNSC Resolution 1267 which came about in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 . It was thus a decade and a half late in terms of compliance . The JuD was added to it in 2008 , which means the action against the JuD came eight years late , and Hafiz Saeed himself was slapped with a ten million dollar head-money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action on his person late by about five years . <p> Clearly the question then : why now ? Especially when , following the 2008 Mumbai attack , the JuD chief had been incarcerated under immense Indian pressure to appease Indian sensitivities and yet in each instance courts threw the case out for being void of legal basis . The Mumbai case against seven JuD workers has also now adjourned for eternity -- there being no material progress for lack of any concrete evidence that can link their persons to what happened then in Mumbai . <p> It was a clear mismatch from the very beginning . The crime scene was India ; that is where the evidence existed and that is where the trial was conducted . The lone witness , Ajmal Kasab , and a couple more said to have facilitated the attackers were all in India but would not be given access to Pakistani prosecutors or defence lawyers . Instead dossiers upon dossiers of written pages were exchanged ; because of absent evidentiary value without further testimony , they were the first thing thrown out by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misdirection because of a possibility of miscarriage of process as well as justice were the courts to ramrod a decision based on any kind of pressure . <p> Till , of course , something gave and Hafiz Saeed was apprehended under a , till now , long forgotten international treaty towards elimination of terrorism . This when Donald himself is finding it difficult to explain to others how he may like to eliminate ' Islamic terror from the face of this earth ' . His bigger problem is an inadequate team comprising mostly of his campaign men who have now taken station in all the important offices of the White House but know zilch about policy . Their exhortation is increasingly being understood as policy . So if it is ' Mr white ' , Stephen Bannon , he has his own brand to spew while Sean Spicer is the mouthpiece who sounds those exhortations to the world . The cabinet secretaries are yet not fully in place and the administration is shorn of policy structures . It must then do with those in the president 's retinue . Together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is thus that Pakistan enters the act . The seven nations that were to be excommunicated from the US did not include Pakista ; that surprised our Foreign Office . That also opened a window of doing something that just might thaw the anger within Donald 's mind about Pakistan 's credentials -- touted by him while expressing his support to his future bosom buddy , Narendra Modi . Just to refresh : when asked during the campaign how he would tackle a difficult and nuclear Pakistan , he had suggested that he would let India take care of that little problem there . Shackling Saeed would surely ensure against possible malfeasance , real or perceived . <p> Let 's not get too cocky about the base nobility that drives Donald 's mind-games or for that matter the niceties that Modi will bring to the Donald-Modi nexus , for they can be toxic and vile when they come together . Donald would like India to do something about Pakistan , and Modi would have a list of options -- choosing the dirtiest and the most dangerous to execute to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in kind and mind . Now if that hurtles uncontrolled down the slippery slope making escalation dominance too complex for Donald , it will force on him a certain ' Houston ' moment too early in his tenure . North Korea , just by itself , is a handful . <p> But I have gotten too far ahead of Nafees Zakaria . I think having saved grace in the first Donald assault , Pakistan decided to pre-empt Donald 's sequel . In that it has , by incarcerating Saeed , shown the goodness of the state . Modi 's main refrain against Pakistan too has been shelved for the moment , though another one still might appear ; he is ingenuous enough . So hardly a policy decision , as both the military spokesman and Zakaria propounded , but a knee-jerk meant to pre-empt what may be coming next . This is policy driven by fear and apprehension . India can be trusted to give more causes to Donald to leash or lash Pakistan with , and there are a few -- Dawood Ibrahim , Masood Azhar and for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these are fears of an ordinary mind , except the last on the list which will need a more complex treatment . <p> Donald is no Donald if he conforms to the known . Nor would he be a billionaire if he could n't ' create ' and then fail to ' make ' a deal . Trust him on both . Given so , would he settle for some ' inconsequentials ' at the level of the ' bigly ' objectives he seeks ? To India he would like to sell more and get some honey in return . And then irk China enough to slow its economy down . This when China may also be grappling with a more assertive neighbourhood in the South China Sea , enough to drive its focus away from its economic trail . At the same time , by correlating India 's power with Pakistan he may be able to leverage more out of Pakistan in return for a shoulder . Afridi may only be the spare change in the ' bigly ' matters of Haqqanis , the tactical nukes and -- yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears , the more it will give away . The ' art of the deal ' suggests that whatever may seem vulnerable and thus appropriate to shed must be so done but at favourable terms . We incarcerated Hafiz Saeed only on an apprehension , guilt and fear driving our action than bartering for a reasonable return . No man is bigger than the collective national good . If Pakistan can manage a packaged good for what seems shed-able , the deal would have been well executed . Rather than fear , Pakistan 's leadership should be mastering the nuances of making good deals . With Donald 's America that may be the way ahead for the foreseeable future . <p> Email : shhzdchdhry@yahoo.com <p> 0 <p> 0 <p> Making sense of Donald was posted in Opinion of TheNews International - https : //www.thenews.com.pk on February 10 , 2017 and was last updated on February 10 , 2017 .

@@16885236 <h> Email <p> The current rising tide of protectionism to restrict international flows of capital , goods and manpower , particularly in the United States , is facing fierce opposition from critics . This is happening in those developed economies which have freer trade and are more integrated into the global economy . <p> Protectionism tends to disrupt the global market but the new American administration sees it as imperative to restructure its domestic economy . <p> On the other hand , free trade has lost much of its lustre because of the growing popular perception worldwide that it does not necessarily mean fair trade . <p> Usually developing countries complain against the adverse terms in international trade . This standpoint now has been now owned by US President Donald Trump , making him reject US regional trade treaties . <p> Historical records show that protectionism and free trade have been coupled , in various ways and proportions , to develop domestic and international businesses , markets and economies across the world with mixed outcomes . <p> Pakistan 's efforts to integrate the national economy with the global market have been frustrated by chronic fiscal , trade and balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought out policy of protectionism or liberalisation and deregulation that resulted in heavy dependence on foreign debt , capital and financial inflows . Its path of growth was also hampered by macro-economic instability . <p> The policymakers ' ' focus on subsidised export-oriented industrialisation , with imported capital goods and other industrial inputs -- in the absence of an effective import-substitution policy -- has kept the external sector under constant pressure . <p> In the past three years , the country 's exports have dropped from some $25bn to $20bn -- for lack of enough value-addition and diversification -- and have widened the trade deficit as imports continue to grow at a fast pace . <p> Initially , like all newly created nation states , Pakistan went for import-substitution and self-sufficiency where it had a domestic advantage . Being an agricultural country , the natural choice was to set up cotton ginning , textile and sugar mills and a leather industry . <h> Historical records show that protectionism and free trade have been coupled , in various ways and proportions , to develop domestic and international businesses , markets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry argument was advanced to protect manufacturing from inflows of foreign goods and services . Tax incentives , cheap credit and subsidised foreign exchange were provided to spur manufacturing with significant success . And high tariff walls were raised and imports were selectively banned to foster import substitution and protect local manufacturing from competition from foreign goods . <p> When these government subsidies peaked owing to rent-seeking and patronages , they hampered the productivity and efficiency required to develop a competitive global economy . In some segments , monopolies , cartels and oligopolies were allowed to develop and prosper without much hindrance . This kept new comers out of the market and restricted the country 's economic growth . <p> Even now regulatory bodies are essentially a toothless lot . With free trade and competition restricted in domestic market , government support became imperative for exporters to access the the international market . <p> It must be conceded though that the industry did receive a huge setback from a sharp devaluation of the rupee in the early 1970s ( financial charges shot up ) , loss of the East Pakistan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and deregulation ' of the following decades , resulted in de-industrialisation . <p> Even leading business houses diversified their investment into trading in commodities , real estate and capital markets . The practice continues to this day which , coupled with diversifying and multiple businesses under one umbrela , may help industry and trade to shake off the crutches and stand on their own feet ; with only an occasional and temporary government support to sectors hit by external shocks . <p> Protectionism must not be extended to mismanaged and inefficient enterprises . Corporate deaths should be taken as a natural phenomenon . <p> The shifting policy focus now on the domestic market in many countries has given rise to protectionism while free trade , which prospered during the high tide of globalisation , is being restricted . <p> But protectionism loses its utility when it results in rent-seeking , monopolies , cartels and oligopolies . Similarly free trade loses its lustre if the impression that it does not deliver a fair game , gains ground . <p> So there is a need to bring about a structural change in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build a more equitable exchange of goods and services for which the community of nations should work with greater harmony and active cooperation . <p> Globalisation is taking a new course , more or less similar to what China is trying to do . China is fiercely nationalist and its domestic economy works largely under a protectionist regime . Its approach is determined by domestic needs rather than external policy influences . <p> Yet its huge foreign trade , including imports , contributes significantly to the world 's economic growth . Its investments abroad help other countries to reduce infrastructural gaps needed to push up economic growth . <p> It is time that national states help each other build self-sustaining economies . This would not mean self-sufficiency in all respects which currently provides the space for international cooperation .

" <p> He ruffled many a feather by saying " I get more love in India than in Pakistan , " before the World Twenty20 started in India last year , but that simply came from the heart as he had been one of few Pakistanis who was loved across the border . <p> His aggressive style had also resulted in a number of bans which forced him to miss some crucial matches , significantly the first two in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fan after walking to the dressing room at Centurion , Afridi threatened to hit him with his bat .

It resulted in one Test and two ODI bans . <p> But the worst of them all was a blatant attempt to chew the ball to alter its condition during the Perth ODI in Australia in 2010 . A ban of two Twenty20 ensued . <p> But all said and done , Afridi has been a star , a crowd puller who graced cricket field in a way very few could boast off . He will surely be missed .

If anything was clear even as the bodies were being counted and wounded shifted to hospitals , it was that time had finally come for the Punjab Operation . No longer would khadim-e-aala be able to dribble this one around . <p> And indeed it has come . So has Radd-ul-Fasaad , which is even bigger news , of course . But has n't much of what is being said in the wake of the new operation already been said , way back then , in the wake of the first operation ? Was n't NAP already in place ; just crying for implementation ? Is it that we did not see it then that we would need a whole new operation to implement NAP , or is there more to these new initiatiaves ? <p> To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , DNA talked exclusively to senior security analyst Brig Mahmood Shah . <p> Question : Why do you think there has been a sudden surge in terrorist activity , especially since we believed the ' terrorists ' back was broken ' , etc ? <p> Mahmood Shah : Yes , I agree that the terrorists back was broken during the Operation Zarb-e-Azb . The entire infrastructure of terrorists ' , especially their outfits , was destroyed in North Waziristan and the terrorists of all hues and colours had either fled into Afghanistan or had been killed in the operation . <p> Now they are trying to establish their network in the Afghan province of Kunnar , which borders Pakistan . They have been planning attacks from there and the recent surge in terrorist attacks has been launched from the same Afghan province . Effective measures are being taken and the entire Pakistan-Afghan border is being sealed . <p> The government needs to install modern gadgets at the border posts and data collection should be made about those Pakistanis who cross into Afghanistan and then return . If any Pakistan is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and investigated whether he was involved in any sort of terrorist training or was receiving funds . The border management systems must be adequate and the SoPs must be followed strictly . <p> This new wave of terrorist attacks would come to an end soon as effective measures are being taken by the military establishment under the Operation Radd-ul-Fasaad . <p> Q : Di you believe this new wave of terrorist attacks is aimed at sabotaging the efforts to hold PSL Final Match in Lahore or the ECO ( Economic Cooperation Organisation ) Summit starting next week in Islamabad ? <p> MS : Frankly , I believe it 's more of a coincidence . But you can never rule out any possibility really . The enemy 's designs revolve around destablising Pakistan and any move which could make Pakistan insecure place might be a part of the plan . <p> The recent election of a main culprit of Lashkar-e-Jhangvi to Punjab assembly and his later joining of a party which is an ally of the federal government is grave in nature . This looks to be an action by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrorism needs a lot of planning , coordination and funding . One needs to plan , train and prepare for months to mount such attacks across the border . So one needs to understand that if it was planned to attack the PSL or ECO , they would have information about these events months in advance . <p> You must have noticed that before this new wave of terrorism , there was peace for many months and not a single incident took place . It looks to be a plan to surprise the government . Perhaps the terrorists took advantage of the transition in the change of command in the military top brass . <p> Moreover , it seems that there was lack of coordination between the government departments while going public with announcements of big events like the PSL or the ECO summit . <p> In future , the government would need to take more effective actions to preempt any terrorist attack before such big announcements as happens in the modern world . <p> Q : Critics claim that inaction against proscribed outfits like Lashkar-e-Jhangvi , Ahl-e-Sunnat wal Jama'at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Pakistan . How do you see such allegations ? <p> MS : Action would be taken against all proscribed organisations and a strategy , I believe , is being worked out . Moreover , organisations like Lal Masjid can easily be isolated and the movement of activists from banned outfit can be monitored . <p> But normally it 's not happening and rather the terrorists are using common citizens as their facilitators . Just take the example of the Lahore attack masterminds who used a resident of Bajaur agency who received the suicide bomber from Torkhum border and escorted him to Lahore . The suicide jacket had been transported through a truck driver by bribing him with two lakh rupees . So they are luring common citizens through economic incentives and not out of their religious leanings . <p> The government needs to sensitise the public and also alleviate poverty which is actually being used as a terrorist tool to lure the innocent and unemployed youth . <p> Q : Do you feel this so called Operation Ghazi , announced by Jamaat ul Ahrar , is what it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a decade since the Lal Masjid operation , and the Masjid has clearly distanced itself from JA . <p> MS : One needs to understand the modus operandi of these terrorist outfits . Jamaat ul Ahrar has only support of terrorists up to Mohmand Agency . Initially , it had recruiters from Bajaur Agency too but now they have disintegrated and dispersed . I do n't think that Operation Ghazi had any connection with Lal Masjid . I suppose the JuA is trying to seek support from likeminded people desperately and that was the reason they codenamed the operation after the Lal Masjid cleric . <p> Q : In your opinion , will Operation Radd-ul-Fasaad depart from the contours of Zarb-e-Azb , or does it simply imply more of the same but in a more coordinated manner ? <p> MS : Radd-ul-Fasaad is different from Operation Zarb-e-Azb in concept and tactical approach too . Zarb-e-Azb was aimed at destroying all infrastructure and sanctuaries of terrorists from North Waziristan Agency . Then the army had sweeping operations in nearby agencies up to Khyber and Shawwal valleys and adjoining Pak-Afghan bordering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with urban centers a specific focus . This operation would have three pillars : Military action ; intelligence gathering across country ; and active and aggressive diplomacy to make Afghanistan move against terrorists using its soil against Pakistan . <p> Q : Why is there the stress , once again , on going after all kinds of terrorists ? Does this imply that the last effort was not thorough enough ? <p> MS : For the time being , let me say , we are only doing fire-fighting rather than taking a real war to the terrorists . We are just running around across Pakistan without a comprehensive strategy to wipeout terrorism . Rather , we need to have a through , deep thinking before launching the operation . <p> The recent rounding up of thousands of people from across the country is just typical police action aimed at creating a media hype just to satisfy the angry public at large after a flurry of terrorist attacks which have triggered a sense of anger and fury against the government . Those arrested would soon be released by the courts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not improved . <p> Q : The Karachi Operation began with a stipulated time limit but latter dragged on and became not just open ended , of sorts , but also very politicised . Do you have similar fears about Punjab ? <p> MS : The federal and Punjab governments would have to shun their previous policies if they really mean business and stern action needs to be taken against the terrorists . The recent election of a main culprit of Lashkar-e-Jhangvi to Punjab assembly and his later joining of a party which is an ally of the federal government is grave in nature . This looks to be an action by the government to vindicate terrorism . The military would have to take action if government fails to do it .

Most of the arguments raised are without any sources and look groundless in view of the facts available about the CPEC investments <p> Gunfire , suicide bombings , diplomatic plots -- it seems the China-Economic Corridor ( CPEC ) is under attack from all sides . While the detractors used diplomatic lures and ambassadorial snubs to get the economic corridor revoked and renounced , conspiracies are being hatched to sabotage CPEC projects . <p> Nationalists and politicians stirred issues like route controversy , provinces ' shares in CPEC investments , etc . Now , intellectuals and journalists are out with knives to seed suspicion and doubts about Chinese investments and CPEC projects . <p> First , let 's examine media role in the CPEC fire . <p> Pieces are being printed to raise questions about the negative impact of CPEC on Pakistan 's poor people . From environmental hazards of energy projects to the impact of loans and interest rates , all ploys are being coined in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While even the Pakistani investors were shifting their investments abroad , Chinese investors jumped in to help save Pakistan irrespective of risks involved with their ventures . <p> In a recent article titled " Capital Suggestion " , some questions have been raised about the Chinese investments in Pakistan . Most of the arguments raised are without any sources and look groundless in view of the facts available about the CPEC investments . <p> Since I have been monitoring CPEC since its launch and government officials keep sharing official documents about CPEC with me , I would like to add to the subject . <p> Let 's discuss the argument of raised about the financial cost involved in CPEC . The article suggests that the debt amount involved with an energy project shall carry an interest rate of LIBOR ( London Interbank Offered Rate ) plus 4.5 percent . This is totally a distorted figure . <p> Moreover , the claim that the Chinese loan shall bear an interest rate of 6.21 percent is also unfounded . <p> The matter of the fact is that the interest rate involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be flexible too . So the claim of 6.21 percent is groundless . <p> The interest rate is quite lower than the European and American countries where the charge is 20 percent more . <p> Moreover , the author failed to identify the fact that the insurance premium of seven percent would be a one-time charge to be paid in 15 years ' time -- thereby meaning that actually it would be around 0.5 percent annually . <p> The alleged 27.2 percent return on equity in the Sahiwal Coal Power Project and return rate of 34.49 percent at Thar Coal Power are imaginary and have no evidence to support the claim . <p> As far as the comparison between Chinese investments in the US treasury and Pakistan is concerned , one may ask how one would draw a comparison between the investments in Pakistan and the American treasury ? The investments in the American treasury have guarantees of all sorts and both have no parallels at all . <p> One needs to remember the circumstances when the Chinese leadership decided to invest in Pakistan when even the ruling elite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destinations abroad . <p> A quick look back at the sequence of events since 2013 reflects a dismal picture which was being projected as when China was asked to invest into Pakistan , the entire world was raising questions about chances of its survival . <p> When Mian Nawaz Sharif took oath as the country 's third-time elected prime minister on 5 June 2013 , energy-starved Pakistan was facing huge challenges on internal , external , diplomatic and economic fronts . <p> While terrorists were targeting security forces , politicians , professionals and human rights workers with impunity , the country was also facing an economic logjam with dwindling foreign exchange reserves , little or literal no investment and falling exports . <p> The energy crisis was so severe that thousands of businesses were shifted to Bangladesh , Malaysia , Dubai and other destinations in the region . Moreover , violence in Karachi led many businesses to close down and shift too . <p> In 2013 , some 5,000 to 6,000 traders completely closed down their businesses while over 5,000 small to large units in Karachi , mostly of textiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse at the global front as international institutions were raising questions about the fate of Pakistan . <p> On 25 April 2013 , just before the general elections , in his article titled " Is Pakistan a failing state " , Prof Gustav Ranis discussed the prospects of Pakistan becoming a failing state . <p> " In the absence of fundamental change , political as well as economic , unlikely under present circumstances , there is little hope Pakistan can emerge from the category as failing state , " he wrote in his conclusion . <p> Even a year after the Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif took oath , the situation remained dismal . An article published in Dawn , on 25 October 2014 , said if the dangerous drift continues , the state of Pakistan will have failed itself too . " So much so that it ( Pakistan ) may forfeit the right to call itself a viable entity . Many patriots will take umbrage with this assessment but what else will Pakistan be when its key institutions fail to stand up for it ? " <p> A paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Failed State ?

The initiative proved to be game-changing which has worked as a magic wand for Pakistan 's transformation . <p> Since its launching in April 2015 , CPEC has not only brought a total economic turnaround for Pakistan in practical terms , it has also helped an absolute transformation of the image of the country . Once coined as a ' failed state ' by most of the global financial institutions , think-tanks and media outlets , Pakistan today is being tagged as the most promising Asian economy . <p> Fast forward to 2017 now , it is a total shift in the world perspective . From International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) to the World Bank and from Moody 's , all are in praise for Pakistan 's economic transformation . <p> In April 2016 , Moody 's Investors Service gave Pakistan B3 rank , rating balances strengthening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government debt burden and political risks . <p> In July last year , the IMF increased forecast for Pakistan 's growth to 5pc in the fiscal year to June 2017 , from a previous estimate of 4.7pc , citing China 's plans to invest in road and energy infrastructure under the CPEC . <p> In July 2016 , Atlantic Media Company ( AMC ) of the United States ranked Pakistan as comparatively stronger economy in South Asian Markets and expected it will grow rapidly during days ahead . <p> According to Atlantic s report the Pakistan government 's investment in infrastructure and other developmental projects has caused country 's GDP to grow . <p> The ranking has been based on the political stability and continuity of policies in the South Asian countries that include India , Sri Lanka , Pakistan , Bangladesh , and Nepal . <p> In November 2016 , Bloomberg said China 's billions were now luring once shy foreign investors to Pakistan .

Rather , Beijing , being a time-tested strategic partner of Islamabad , has come to the rescue at the international level too . China has vetoed five successive efforts by India against Pakistan at the United Nations . <p> In an apparent bid to counter India 's diplomatic onslaught , China has been endeavouring to forge new regional alliances , involving Russia , Turkey , Iran and Afghanistan .

@@17153236 <h> Serious gaps in census planning pointed out <p> ISLAMABAD : Just a fortnight before the start of the long overdue exercise , parliamentarians and a demographic expert have found serious gaps in planning and execution of the headcount -- a situation that may affect credibility of the census in some parts of the country . <p> Issues -- like counting of the Temporarily Displaced Persons ( TDPs ) , insufficient census blocks and absence of post-census enumerations survey for crosschecking of facts -- were highlighted as ' matters of concern ' in a meeting of Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Statistics , held on Monday . <p> The senators observed that if the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics ( PBS ) -- the body responsible for holding census -- left these matters unaddressed , the credibility of the exercise at the Federally Administrated Tribal Areas ( Fata ) and some parts of Sindh might be called into question at global forums . <p> The committee meeting was called to prepare a report for the consideration of the upper house of parliament after Senator Saleh Shah , elected from the Federally Administered Tribal Areas ( Fata ) , raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Operation Zarb-e-Azb . <p> Out of the five tehsils of South Waristan Agency , people have not returned to their homes in three tehsils due to lack of community infrastructure , said Shah while explaining the ground realities in areas worst affected by the military 's cleansing up operation . <p> He said in order to count the tribal people , the PBS-prepared special form should be distributed across the country -- a demand that the PBS immediately rejected . At one stage , Senator Shah hinted at boycotting the exercise . <p> The Chief Census Commissioner Asif Bajwa said that out of seven tribal agencies , as many as three were still disturbed . Bajwa said the PBS sent this special form to the Fata Secretariat but it did not make any progress on that . <p> He said the Fata Secretariat 's official response was that there were no TDPs in the country after December 31 , 2016 -- a claim that Bajwa himself admitted was contrary to the reality . The chief census commissioner said a meeting was held in Fata Secretariat on Monday to find a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretariat 's TDPs data and the Wattan Card information -- a special card given to the TDPs for receiving cash assistance -- to help count Fata 's people . However , Shah rejected both the options , saying all the tribal people did not register for the card or went to the special camps . <p> The Census commissioner said after Fata Secretariat 's silence on the matter , the PBS did not print special forms for the TDPs ; therefore there was no question for their distribution . <p> The sixth population census will begin with house-listing on March 15 and will be completed in two phases . The first phase of house-listing will end on March 17 , after which census forms -- tagged as Form-2 -- will be filled from March 18 to 27 . Homeless people will be counted on March 28 . <p> However , the senators , notably Senator Saeed Ghani of the PPP , raised the issue of insufficient census blocks . The PBS has divided the country into over 168,017 census blocks . Each block consists of 250 to 300 houses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accompanied by a military man . <p> Ghani said a survey carried out by the census staff in Karachi revealed that there was requirement of 45 blocks to timely cover the entire population in an area where the PBS had notified only 13 blocks . " This will make it difficult for the enumerator to timely complete the task , " Ghani said , adding that the basis of block formation was wrong . <p> Bajwa said this issue of higher than the presumed households in a particular block will be addressed during the house listing exercise , adding that the BPS has sufficient reserve staff to meet the additional work force requirements . <p> Demographer 's concerns <p> The standing committee received a presentation from Mehtab S Karim -- a member of the government-constituted Expert Committee on Population Census with experience of analysing results of the last two population censuses . <p> Karim said census exercise might take longer than the planned time in cities due to more numbers of houses in a particular block . He said the PBS should resolve four major issues before entering into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan for a post-enumeration survey might create credibility issues in the eyes of global agencies , as crosschecking of facts was very important . " Plans for supervision and analysis of data are also missing , " Karim said . " It is necessary to analyse the information on fast track basis , " he added . <p> His third major concern was that the PBS had not worked out population estimates for each province , which was necessary for better management . The pilot census exercise has not been carried out to know the ground realities , he said . <p> Karim said the PBS was not collecting the migration data in the upcoming exercise , which was important for better planning . He claimed that in the 1998 population census , the Sindh province 's population was understated by six million people . His claim was based on the analysis of 1998 population data .

While the government has projected the China Pakistan Economic Corridor as a panacea for all ills facing Pakistan , little attention has been paid to the local population .

The attack has been claimed by the terrorist outfit Jamaatul Ahrar that enjoys safe havens in Afghanistan and neither Afghan Government nor American forces have taken any substantive action against outfit . Afghanistan has been demanding opening of the border on the pretext of humanitarian crisis caused by its closure and Sartaj-Atmar discussions centred on the very theme but the latest attack has once again proved that Pakistani move was motivated by considerations of security .

@@17490237 <h> Empowering the defenders <p> THE Armed Forces of Pakistan having been chastised for almost a decade now have reverted to its true role as the defenders of the country 's geographical and ideological frontiers . But it seems that the political constituency of the country is either still weary and fearful of the Armed Forces capacity to sideline the civilian set-up or is unmindful of the gravity of the obtaining security situation in the country created largely by external forces but also contributed to by their own inert policies that it keeps staging false flag operations to superficially assert its authority ; the present stalemate over extension of military courts being a glaring example . It is by now a foregone conclusion that the Government apparatus falling short of its capacity and duty to restore law and order and ensure safety of life and property had to per force call upon assistance of the Armed Forces to restore order . Establishment of military courts in the absence of proper prosecution , speedy trial , punishment and execution by the civilian set-up , was part of the National Action Plan to quell crime , terror and insurgency . Analysing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attributed to non-implementation of majority of factors other than the Armed Forces role ; those assigned to the Government .

While being in a state of war and Operation Radd-ul-Fasaad in the country , the Government and the opposition instead of instantly authorizing the extension of military courts for speedy trial , have only last Thursday after dragging their feet for a good two months , indicated doing so conditionally on ' give and take basis in State interest ' .

It would be quite in order for the Armed Forces to make it a precondition to extension of the tenure of military courts that the authorisation be across the board , and that their ordered convictions be speedily executed to serve as a deterrent to criminals and terrorists , without which it will remain a futile exercise and a gleeful reprieve for the enemy .

No wonder the Afghan Government in retaliation to the Pakistani list of terrorists availing its sanctuaries to attack Pakistan delivered its own more inflated one , undoubtedly fed to it by Indian Consulates anchored in Afghanistan . Pakistan rejected their list informing them that it was not only presumptuous but that any terrorist sanctuaries on this side of the border had been destroyed and most of names in the Afghan list either eliminated during Pakistan 's Zarb-e-Azb operation besides those who fled and were currently enjoying Indian protection and hospitality in Afghanistan .

Hafiz Saeed has offered to face any charges if brought against him in a Court of Law , be it the UN or anyone else , but he has been detained by the Government without taking the people into confidence about his misdemeanour , whereas barring unsubstantiated allegations and sanctions by the UN nothing concrete till this day has been brought against him .

@@17490239 <h> Poverty &amp; unemployment nightmare <p> WE know where the poor are and we also know where the rich and richest are . Sadly this gap between the two is rising at an alarming rate . We know there are people who are hardly able to afford one meal a day and we also know that there are people whose one-dinner bill is equal to one year food for some . The gap between " haves " and " haves-not " is widening in spite of best efforts of governments and private entities . The millennium goals set by UN are still hard and far to achieve . True the global economy is on a bumpy drive since last 7-8 years but there are people who turned millionaires and billionaires during these rough and tough times . Their wealth increased manifold while the poor got poorer and it is becoming out of reach for them to have a decent one-time meal . Who is to blame for this malaise . Are the governments responsible for it or the individuals ? I would say both . Governments because they do n't enact stringent laws which check " in-equality " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with poor , hungry , mal-nourished and down-trodden . We know global poverty and literacy scenario . About 900 million people can not read and write . Almost 57 million primary school age children are not in school and 49% will never be able to go to school . Over 774 million adults are illiterate of which 2/3 are females . The $1.90 per person per day threshold for extreme poverty is a standard adopted by the World Bank and other international organizations to reflect the minimum consumption and income level needed to meet a person 's basic needs . That means that people who fall under that poverty line -- 1/8 of the world 's population , or 800 million people -- lack the ability to fulfil basic needs , whether it means eating only one bowl of rice a day or forgoing health care when it 's needed most . The largest portion of the world 's poor is the 800 million poor women , children , and men who live in rural areas . They tend to live in remote areas that are at great distances from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mothers and fathers , most of whom are daily work labourers , subsistence farmers , herders , and migrant workers . They struggle to meet basic everyday needs , such as feeding their families at least two meals a day , or taking their children to a clinic when they have fallen ill . The rural poor also work in insecure and relatively low-paying jobs , have little education , and may experience discrimination as women and as members of ethnic minorities . For all of these reasons , the rural poor themselves say that they suffer from hunger , ill health , illiteracy , instability , and low self-esteem as well as marginalisation from their own governments who are often unresponsive to their needs and concerns . Empowering rural poor is a critical step in advancing any poverty alleviation effort . Doing so must build on a person 's own willingness and capacities to provide for their family and to forge a more dignified , better future . This requires assets from which to build sustainable livelihoods , education about their rights and how to put those assets to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue building those assets and to cope with future hardships . In fact , most basic financial services reach only 10% of rural communities . The plight of human beings in Sudan is worth mentioning . When fighting broke out in South Sudan in mid-December 2013 , several thousand people packed into the bases of the UN Mission in South Sudan to seek refuge . Most , if not all of them , thought it would be temporary -- they thought things would return to normal and they would be back home soon . Two years have now passed , but 184,000 people are still living in these Protection of Civilians areas . Although they say they appreciate the security provided by the UN peacekeepers and the humanitarian assistance they receive , many also worry about how long they can keep living in protected but isolated camps within their own country . Over the last decade , a large share of the population in the Europe and Central Asia region has benefited from economic advances generated by strong growth in their communities . New opportunities have opened up in labour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about , and people have accumulated new knowledge and assets . On the other hand , the economic transition of the 1990s , the recent economic crisis , and other shocks have reduced the role of the state as a source of employment and have taken a toll on many households . Using new qualitative data from nine countries -- Bosnia and Herzegovina , FYR Macedonia , Georgia , Kazakhstan , Kosovo , Kyrgyz Republic , Serbia , Tajikistan and Turkey -- including structured focus group discussions and semi-structured in-depth interviews in 43 communities , a survey report explored factors that have supported or hindered economic mobility and access to jobs among men and women in the region . Listening to people from across Europe and Central Asia reveals that , despite an overall good performance in economic growth and shared prosperity , there is a lot of discontent and rising concerns about a disappearing middle class While economic growth in most countries in the region has created a ladder to better living standards , many people see no open path to climb above the first rungs . Instead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatly and increasingly polarized . Across countries , people are voicing frustration about slow progress , inequality of opportunities and the limited sustainability of the gains that have been achieved . The lack of good jobs , particularly among women and youth , is driving the discontent amidst rising prosperity . Access to jobs is the main factor that can propel households into higher living standards and the middle class , or precipitate a downward spiral . In USA , even at so-called full employment , some 20 million Americans are left behind . They need more work-hours to make both end meet . Their plight comes even as the U.S. flirts with what economists consider the maximum level of employment for the first time since before the recession , having added 15.8 million jobs since the start of 2010 . While some of America 's jobless are simply between gigs , those persistently stuck out of work are called the structurally unemployed . However , jobs are seen as out of reach for a large share of people , with social norms and the lack of professional and social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job . The overwhelming majority of people in the region , even youth , still associate the middle class and upward mobility with jobs that are full-time , formal and with open contracts . The vast majority still aspire to a public sector job because of various factors-access to power being dominant . Targeted social policies aimed at reducing poverty are widespread today , both among rich countries and , increasingly , among emerging middle-income economies . Concerns about their incentive effects have long been prominent . Do they create disincentives for participants to earn more income , leading to a poverty trap , is still a big question . The bottom line is that Poverty and Un-employment and still two hydra-headed monsters which have affected economic growth , failed to pull many people on earth out of hunger and medical accessibility and reasonably decent living .

The country 's president has been removed from office on the charges of corruption and undermining trust in president 's office by the Supreme Court . It has established separation of power in the country . The eight-member court unanimously found Park guilty . It upheld the decision of the lawmakers . The majority of South Koreans ( 70-80% ) supported ouster of Park for breach of public trust . It is a victory for democracy . Stripped of her immunity , Park will have to face courts like ordinary citizens . She is likely to face corruption charges in these courts including her alleged involvement in Samsung case and a separate $40m bribery case . More than 30 people surrounding her are also going to face criminal proceeding on similar grounds . Park used country 's foreign policy and pro-west alliances to rule the country with impunity . She used pro-west policies to avoid democratic accountability and legal punishment . But her departure shows that national interest won . It is also a message to other world leaders who are involved in similar practices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and democracy . As per the South Korea 's law , presidential elections will have to be held within 60 days . The pro-left power is likely to win . In that case , Park 's departure is positive development for the Korean Peninsula and region itself . It is going to bring an end to pro-west policies in the country , which Park was pursuing . On the face of it , democracy has won . Justice has been served . It took long time to remove Park which shows that every effort was made to save her due to the geo-strategic interests of the West in the Peninsula and beyond . On foreign policy front , Park 's departure could be the start of peace in the Korean Peninsula . Under the Sunshine Policy articulated by President Kim Dae-Jung , South Korea maintained greater political contact with North Korea between 1998 and 2008 . There were two Korean summits in 2000 and 2007 . Kim was awarded Nobel Peace Prize for his successful implementation of Sunshine Policy to bring two countries together . The latest poll results show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are much more accommodative towards the North . They say that let 's talk to them . They are our kith and kin . There is support for opening of existing joint ventures on the border of North and South Korea . The tension had grown between the two countries after Park took office in 2012 . Her departure could bring an end to the confrontational approach and return of peaceful way towards solving the outstanding issues between both countries . It will pave the way for subsequent progress towards easing of cross border movement and other confidence building measures leading towards some kind of " unification " of both countries ultimately . Unfortunately , every time both countries tried to move in this direction , the vested stakes thwarted the efforts including the destruction of South Korean naval vessel carrying 48 troops , troop deployment and exchange of fire . The recent developments of military deployment by South Korea in North Korea 's border area , US-South Korea joint military exercise and US-Japan security alliance have prompted retaliatory reaction from North Korea . Pyongyang defends its actions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense . China has rightly raised its concerns over proposed deployment of US Terminal High Altitude Area Defense System ( THAAD ) in South Korea . Beijing maintains that the system 's range exceeds far beyond South Korea and it undermines China 's strategic interests including its nuclear second-strike capability . Beijing is already unhappy with the situation in the region due to growing Japan military spending and deepening US-Japan defense cooperation following Abe 's Washington visit . With possible election of pro-left leadership , China 's proposal for peace in Peninsula has a future . If the new South Korea president upholds public interest , it could help end western policy of " squeeze and collapse " against North Korea which it pursued with Park 's support . The fear of Koreas heading towards collision course , as warned by Beijing , will subside . But then Pyongyang will have to act responsibly by moving towards denuclearization , returning to dialogues to normalize relations between both countries and opening up with rest of the world . If both Koreas are careful in protecting their interests , they should allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normalizing relations and helping bring peace to the Korean Peninsula and the region . Beijing can support both Koreas at regional level . The West , the UN and EU should support them to resolve their differences peacefully under the agreed frameworks including Sunshine Policy and respect the will of Korean people who want to have closer relations with each other . The end of Park is good for South Korea . But she was just another pawn in international politics . The leaders of Mynmar , India , Israel , UK or Sudan are getting away with corruption , undermining rights of minorities and gross human rights violations as major players protect their geo-strategic interests while the West , the UN and the EU fail to uphold their legal and moral responsibilities .

@@17720238 <p> KARACHI : The State Bank of Pakistan ( SBP ) has anticipated a significant growth in the country 's economy for the current fiscal year , according to its quarterly report released on Friday . <p> The projection is backed by an accelerated productive spending and a rebound in agriculture produce , despite Pakistan experiencing current account and fiscal deficits , along with decelerated growth in revenue collection . <p> " The real Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) growth in fiscal year 2016-17 is expected to be 5-6% , higher than last year 's 4.7% , " said the SBP report . <p> Major contribution is expected from the rebound in agriculture and increased pace of work on infrastructure and energy projects . In particular , the completion of energy projects under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ) is expected to provide additional boost to industrial growth . <p> " These expectations are in line with continuing robust trends in the private sector credit and import of machinery and raw materials , " the report said . <p> Meanwhile , the growth in large-scale manufacturing industries , though likely to fall short of its target , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The textile industry is expected to post some recovery in second half January-June 2017 of the current fiscal year , as the cash-flow constraints of exporters may ease following the recently announced export package , " said the report . <p> " The commencement of operations of new power plants and the sustained increase in liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) imports are expected to help electricity generation and gas distribution to maintain last year 's momentum . Similarly , the growth in the construction sector is also likely to remain robust , " it added . <p> Additionally , the services sector is expected to achieve its target growth rate for the year . This is backed by the current trends in trade , especially imports , higher production and sale of commercial vehicles , substantial increase in bank credit , flourishing housing schemes and rising internet subscription . <p> Inflation <p> The SBP announced that the inflation rate is expected to remain low and stable in the backdrop of increase in agriculture production , stable exchange rate and a limited pass-through of rising international commodity prices to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflation is expected to remain in the 4-5% range against target of 6% , " said the report . <p> Moreover , the less-than-warranted increase in domestic fuel prices would limit its direct and second round impact on inflation , according to the SBP . The recent increase in investment demand as reflected by the widening of twin deficits may not have an adverse impact on inflation either . <p> Current account <p> According to the central bank , Pakistan 's current account deficit is likely to increase in the view of strong growth in imports as well as developments in international commodity prices . However , the country 's foreign exchange reserves will remain at a comfortable level . <p> " Some gains in exports due to the recently announced export package are expected to be offset by muted remittance growth , " said the report . " The declining number of Pakistani employees abroad , the British pound 's depreciation against the US dollar and stricter regulatory controls in the US are the main factors that will likely keep remittance inflows close to last year 's level . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiscal gap will be higher than the target due to the impact of recently announced export package , assuming no significant change in revenue collection occurs . <p> " Given the actual fiscal deficit is 2.4% of GDP in the first half of the fiscal year , the full-year fiscal gap will be higher than the target of 3.8% , " said the report . " Growth in tax revenue decelerated to 6.2% during the same period as compared to over 20% increase last year . This slowdown seems to be an unintended consequence of various tax measures to support investment , growth and exports . " <p> On the other hand , expenditures are likely to remain elevated due to the government 's commitment to complete most of the power and infrastructure projects by close of fiscal year 2017-18.

@@17787230 <p> Last week , the USDA , in partnership with CABI ( Centre for Agriculture and Bioscience International ) and Texas A&amp;M University , concluded a six-year training programme in Pakistan . The goal of the $4 million endeavour was to promote agriculture exports by strengthening Pakistan 's sanitary and phytosanitary ( SPS ) skills and knowledge . <p> A total of 27 of Pakistan 's regulatory and scientific officials were trained . Officials were present mostly from the Department of Plant Protection -- the federal body responsible for export-related standards -- as well as from the Punjab Agriculture Extension department . <p> Such donor-funded programmes are always welcome in Pakistan , especially when they are refreshingly pragmatic and not mere eyewash . Indeed , Pakistan is nowhere near its fullest potential when it comes to exports , particularly in horticulture ( Read " Mango Exports , " published on May 05 , 2016 ) , for the very reason that we fail to meet SPS requirements . A programme aimed at this particular weak spot is very welcome , provided that it actually translates into something . <p> From the event , it appeared that the DPP officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . BR Research spoke to one of the 27 graduates who was affiliated with the Punjab Agriculture Department , who highly praised the learning experience and said that the knowledge would definitely be applied and included into the horticulture policy that is currently in the works ( here 's hoping ! ) <p> A couple of quick points are worth mentioning . Firstly , there needs to be better coordination between the centre and provinces . The DPP is a federal body , while agriculture is with the provinces . It 's the DPP 's job to know what the international standards are and the provincial Agriculture Department 's job to implement them . Clearly , this has been lacking thus far , and may persist going forward as well . <p> Secondly , although the USDA programme did provide technical assistance , training , and support , it did not have a component of identifying export markets and creating the linkages between local growers and foreign buyers . Yes , we now know what standards our produce must meet , but who will connect our local growers with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DPP by imparting skills , knowledge , and training , but it does not build the institution 's capacity . <p> Perhaps this column has become too cynical over the passage of time , and maybe we should just see a good thing as a good thing and not complain too much .

Last Sunday and the following Monday , about a dozen Kashmiri youth -- mainly teenagers -- were brutally killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Srinagar parliamentary constituency . Those felled were murdered indiscriminately , testifying to India 's growing belief in brutal murders as the only prescription for the growing resentment and yearning for freedom . <p> The massive state violence against Kashmiris is not unique , but the unprecedented polling-day violence was a first . What was a bigger surprise for the occupation authorities was the massive public response . Thousands of youth came out on the streets , refusing to be cowered by the flying Indian bullets , and marched towards the polling stations to register their resentment . As a result , less than seven percent votes were polled -- the lowest in the history of the elections under the occupation , bringing a new low for the process . The boycott was so strong the Indian authorities had to cancel the polls for the Islamabad ( Anantnag ) constituency to offer some respite to Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti who has fielded her brother -- a new entrant to the booming business of family politics that chooses to ignore the mass murder of Kashmiris on a daily basis -- as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered a re-poll for 38 polling stations this week . It was to offer some face-saving to the polling exercise and force people to participate in the sham in order to restore some statistical sanctity to the process . For 38 polling stations , more than 4,000 troops were deployed . On an average , more than 300 troops were deployed for each polling station , turning the places into mini garrisons . This was in addition to thousands of troops with armoured vehicles and heavy armoury manning the streets and roads surrounding the area . Despite all this , people stayed away , casting less than two percent votes and further exposing a lack of public trust in the practice . <p> After failing to subdue or woo Kashmiris , it is not strange that the Indian leadership -- political and military -- is issuing regular threats to Kashmiris and Pakistan . A week after Modi 's threat to the Kashmiri youth to submit or be vanquished , Home Minister Rajnath Singh renewed an earlier threat from the frail-looking Indian army chief , Bipin Rawat , who had warned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " trying to hinder security forces from performing their duties in Kashmir " . <p> Not content with repeating the threat , Singh issued his own chilling warning that promised a transformation in Kashmir within a year , " no matter how the change takes place " . Singh is promising a Daesh-style large-scale massacre and eviction of Kashmiris . Last year in August , when all the state terrorism and murders failed to subdue the public resistance , Rajnath threatened to balkanise Pakistan into 10 pieces while accusing the country of " trying to destabilise India by encouraging terrorism " . Soon after , the Indian forces embarked on ' Operation Tor-Phor ' ( operation destruction ) , initiating a large-scale rampage destroying houses and burning crops . <p> For all its murderous and militaristic rhetoric , the Indian occupation finds itself in uncharted waters . While the Indian political elite and their Kashmiri proxies carry a bog standard template of repression and more repression as the only response , a new generation of Kashmiris is defying the logic of the occupying calculus and , therefore , throwing their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old guard of the pro-freedom leadership -- barring Syed Ali Shah Geelani -- was too susceptible to the ideas of engagement with Indian security and political structures sans any rush or hope for a meaningful outcome . But the new generation has depleted any optimism of extracting anything other than coercion , intimidation and state terrorism from India . Therefore , they remain impassive to any rhetoric -- of hope or intimidation -- that India has fed Kashmiris for the last 70 years . <p> Much to the disadvantage of the Hindutva empire , the new generation of Kashmiris has not only lost fear of death or injury , it also seems to have weaned itself off from any inducements -- real or promised .

@@17957237 <h> Email <p> I WAS N'T aware of this term 's existence till a couple of years ago , and I bet our Chinese friends are n't happy with being associated with it , if only by name . <p> Basically , ' China cutting ' refers to the practice pioneered by the MQM of slicing plots from parks and land earmarked for public amenities , and converting them into residential and commercial property that is sold off for huge profits . Several MQM leaders are alleged to have made fortunes from this daylight robbery when they were in power . <p> So I found it somewhat ironic for Karachi 's mayor , Waseem Akhtar of the MQM , to thunder that " Karachi was nobody 's personal property " . This was in response to the Sindh government 's recent decision ( stayed by the court ) to hand over Clifton 's Bin Qasim Park to the real estate tycoon , Malik Riaz , for 10 years . <p> The idea was for him to spend his own money to restore the dilapidated park after years of neglect under the city and provincial governments . It once had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for by the Japanese , who also supplied the fish and organised their display . Now , the park is a wasteland of scrub , sand dunes and blowing shopping bags . <p> The media jumped on the bandwagon , screaming about yet another scandalous land grab . Now I 'm no fan of Malik Riaz , but the fact is that he has a strong motive to restore the park , as it is clearly visible from his huge high-rise project , and has the deep pockets to clean it up . <h> Many MQM leaders are said to have profited from the practice . <p> But this is n't the only contentious proposal relating to land . Recall the huge wave of indignation that roiled our political waters when it emerged that the former army chief , Raheel Sharif , had been given 90 acres ( 36.4 hectares ) of prime agricultural land as a farewell present . This caused the general 's many admirers to wring their hands in despair , despite the fact that all army chiefs are similarly favoured upon retirement . <p> Pakistan is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is parcelled and sold to serving and retired officers . They then usually flog their plots at a substantial mark-up to civilians . <p> I am not suggesting any illegality here . Nevertheless , this massive real estate operation is seen as being facilitated by the resources and clout available to the military . And while I certainly would not like to see retired officers living in poverty , no other military I know of is as generous as ours when it comes to the officer corps . <p> According to the rules formulated by our long-gone colonial masters , state land could be transferred to the military for specific purposes . However , the land is supposed to revert to the state once it was no longer being put to its designated use . But the latter part of the rule was overlooked , and the military wanted more and more land as cities grew and surrounded army cantonments . <p> So if a firing range , say , could no longer be used without endangering civilians , there was a strong case for asking for more land further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the provincial government , it would be converted into yet another ' defence society ' , developed and allotted to officers who paid the charges in instalments . The land 's prime location would fetch a large profit to its new owners . <p> No notable city in Pakistan is without its own defence society . Agricultural land , too , has been militarised on the pretext of adding to the country 's defences . Thus , it has been pointed out that thousands of acres along Punjab 's border with India were parcelled into farms and sold to retired officers at nominal prices , or allotted to recipients of military honours . The justification was that the presence of armed retired officers and their staff would somehow provide us with a layer of security against an Indian attack . <p> But the security establishment has always been past master of the game , and has put the likes of the MQM and Malik Riaz to shame .

Until greater clarity is provided , it must remain in the category of China cutting .

But ties between Riyadh and Washington became increasingly frayed during the administration of president Barack Obama . <p> Saudi leaders felt Obama was reluctant to get involved in the civil war in Syria and was tilting toward Riyadh 's regional rival Iran .

Trump could also decide to reinforce support for the Arab coalition in Yemen , even if his administration wants the return " as quickly as possible " of UN-backed peace talks , as Mattis said at the start of his Saudi trip . <p> Washington would also like Riyadh to step up its participation in the campaign against the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria .

If any Pakistani choses to live there it 's their own choice and should be respected .

The contribution of overseas Pakistanis must not be neglected . Just like there are some bad people within overseas pakistani community there are bad people livong within our country as well . <p> What is a Norwegian national ? In the US , the word national is used by the libs if they do n't want to use the term " illegal immigrant " . Is is the same in this incidence ? This woman was a Norwegian illegal immigrant ? How would she have flown back to Norway and get back in illegally ? i know it is off-topic of incidenct but just curious.Recommend <p> All those in uniform who were just looking and not stopping this beating not only should be suspended from service for abdicating in their responsibility but also tried for abating . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pakistan.Is this how you treat women in Pakistan ? . FIA staff who physically beat the female should be put behind bars . Tourist advisory will be issued of not to travel to Pakistan ..... this incidence is so sadRecommend <p> FIA is most rude department at the airport most of them even barely read &amp; speak English and posted at international airports this lady constable sould be dismiss from job and has send to jail at least few years to learn good lesson shame on FIA they hire stuped people this FIA individual looks like from very low class family Recommend <p> Well it is not an apology of the FIA woman , but these " foreign nationals " are very often rude , misbehaving and insulting a lot . They think they are so much better than pakistanis , just because they escaped this country a few years ago and got some refugee money . They told how they are victims in Pakistan to get foreign passports , but then they fly here frequently ... If I ask someone for something and he respond he 's not doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever about him , but it is not everyones duty to serve me . So I 'll ask another person ( politely ) , not call the first one an idiot ... Recommend <p> I think I owe an apology to FIA officials for my comment earlier . Just saw the video from Airport camera with shows the other side of the misbehavior at Islamabad International airport . There was some misbehavior with the FIA officials ans specially one of the male staff at the counter . We should watch the videos and views from both sides before we can judge the actual situation . Recommend <p> Please watch full video before going to any conclusion .... Media always shows us one side of story like in this case my friend was at airport and told me that this women was not only acting rudely with FIA staff at airport but also had heated argument with some other passengers there ... Recommend <p> @Grace : I 'm Pakistani and I disagree with what the OP said , but you have no idea . Most young Pakistanis that live abroad want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

That is , Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was not disqualified . And justice , in a sense , was delayed . Yet the Supreme Court verdict in the Panama case on Thursday was historic -- as promised . It has the potential of changing Pakistan 's political landscape . <p> Since we have heard and read all about it -- in fact , bombarded with it ceaselessly -- I need not repeat the gist of the judgment . However , it is rather exceptional that both the parties -- the petitioners and the respondents -- have celebrated it . There have been wars , for that matter , in which the contenders had declared their victories . <p> In the case of Thursday 's verdict , a new offensive is to be launched by the opposition , demanding the prime minister 's resignation and rejecting the proposed formation of a joint investigation team ( JIT ) to probe specific allegations of financial irregularities and money laundering . Hence , this is going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the opportunity for a pause to patiently review the verdict and understand its implications has been rejected . The nation , already exhausted , will not have any respite from a high-pitched political confrontation . Thanks to Imran Khan 's penchant for ' dharna ' politics that is greedily lapped up by the news channels , this seems to be business as usual . <p> We may recall how the tempo rose with the release of the Panama Papers in the first week of April last year when members of the prime minister 's family featured in the records as the owners of offshore companies . Since it was a giant leak of more than 11.5 million financial and legal records , there was a global outrage over a system that allowed wealth acquired through crime , corruption or wrongdoing to be hidden in secret accounts . <p> Of course , many Pakistanis were named in the Panama Papers , including politicians , businessmen and bankers . The list included a serving high court judge and a retired judge . There was a particular focus on properties owned in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verdict was the outcome of petitions heard by a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court headed by Justice Asif Saeed Khosa . These petitions , seeking the prime minister 's disqualification , were filed by PTI chief Imran Khan , JI chief Sirajul Haq and AML leader Sheikh Rasheed Ahmed . <p> There is no doubt that this was a case of historic significance and it did merit extensive coverage . But the main assertion of this column is that it need not have become such a spectacle . It has distracted the media from an appropriate coverage of many crucial issues and developments . Simultaneously , the ruling party has remained too engrossed in Panama-related political wrangling . <p> What 's more , Thursday 's verdict has not given us a sense of closure . In fact , it has triggered a political storm . A weakened Nawaz Sharif has now to confront a more determined opposition . We can be sure that this political turmoil will dominate the media in the days to come and cause a lot of confusion in the minds of ordinary citizens who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affect their existence . <p> Incidentally , in his additional note in the judgment , Justice Azmat Saeed Sheikh has criticised the debate about Panama in the media and the public and has termed it as " ill-informed and misguided " . He added : " Some of the attention unfortunately is contaminated with factually incorrect opinions , legally fallacious concepts and predicted decisions , which are bounced around on the airwaves every evening . The temptation to restrain such media coverage is resisted " . <p> With these profound observations , Justice Sheikh has also said that restricting comments on the court proceedings will perhaps negate the very concept of an open court . But one wonders if the Supreme Court had no role to play in taming the media circus . It served the media 's purpose that the case continued for a long period . It lasted four months and three days , with 36 hearings . Then the judgment was reserved for 57 days . <p> After every hearing , the stalwarts of the contending parties -- the PML-N and the PTI -- would stage their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by all the news channels . Later , the talk shows would pick up the acrimonious debate . But it all amounted to going round in circles without reaching any conclusions . For many discerning viewers , the entire drill was nauseating . But it set the mood and the sense of the overall media coverage . <p> In the midst of all this noise and edginess , we have the gift of a judgment that needs to be carefully studied . Included in the 548-page document is the 192-page dissenting judgment by Justice Asif Saeed Khosa . Its allusion to a quotation from The Godfather has been highlighted in separate reports and I am tempted to copy the opening of Justice Khosa 's scholarly composition . <p> Here it goes : " The popular 1969 novel ' The Godfather ' by Mario Puzo recounted the violent tale of a Mafia family and the epigraph selected by the author was fascinating : ' Behind every great fortune there is a crime ' -- Balzac . The novel was a popular sensation which was made into an acclaimed film . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was written by Honore de Balzac and its original version in French reads as follows ... " <p> On the subject of setting a dangerous precedent by a court of law , Justice Khosa wrote : " I am also reminded of the old bard William Shakespeare " and quoted two lines from ' Merchant of Venice ' . The lines are : " Wrest once the law to your authority . / To do a great right do a little wrong " . However , he explained that he was not wresting the law to his authority and " no little wrong is to be done by me to do a great right in the matter of issuing a declaration against respondent No 1 ( Nawaz Sharif ) " because the original jurisdiction of the court has already been exercised by the court in such matters where disqualification was involved . <p> Take this as an aside . There are more concerns about the passions that are being aroused in our post-Panama verdict Pakistan . It is quite like living in a post-truth world -- a world in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjective interpretation of it .

@@18190240 <h> add The News to homescreen <h> Islamabad <h> Share <p> Advertisement <h> Simple treatment for severe bleeding could save lives of new mothers in Pakistan <p> Rawalpindi <p> A huge percentage of young mothers in Pakistan are dying from heavy bleeding after childbirth known as post-partum haemorrhage , a leading cause of maternal death around the globe that can be prevented and to save thousands of lives of new mothers in the country , it is need of the time to learn from the WOMAN Trial and act on its results which are very encouraging . <p> Head of Gynaecology and Obstetrics Department at Holy Family Hospital Professor Rizwana Chaudhri expressed this while referring to a global trial of a drug called tranexamic acid ( TXA ) , an inexpensive and widely available drug that according to a major study can save the lives of one in three mothers who would otherwise bleed to death after childbirth . <p> More than 5,000 women from 47 hospitals in Pakistan took part in the global trial , which included 20,000 women in 21 countries , mainly in Africa and Asia , and also in the UK and elsewhere , reveals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tranexamic acid ( TXA ) , works by stopping blood clots from breaking down . The study found that death due to bleeding was reduced by 31% if the treatment was given within three hours . The findings also show it reduced the need for urgent surgery to control bleeding ( laparotomy ) by more than a third ( 36% ) . <p> Severe bleeding after childbirth claims lives of more than 100,000 women globally each year but this clot-stabilising drug has the potential to reduce the number substantially . <p> According to the World Health Organization and partners , Pakistan has a maternal mortality rate of 178 deaths per every 100,000 live births . In 2015 there were an estimated 9,700 maternal deaths in the country , and post-partum haemorrhage was the single biggest cause . <p> The London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine coordinated the new study , which is called The WOMAN ( World Maternal Antifibrinolytic ) Trial . It was funded by The Wellcome Trust and UK Department of Health through the Health Innovation Challenge Fund , and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " If tranexamic acid is given quickly enough we could see a reduction in the number of tragic deaths of young mothers and I would urge our hospitals , doctors and community health centres to start administering it as soon as possible , and for us to work together to tackle this issue . " <p> She added that doctors are facing a number of challenges in Pakistan as the majority of babies are delivered in women 's homes in rural areas with no trained medical staff or facilities available . " This is particularly important when it comes to post-partum haemorrhage because time is such a crucial factor in treating it and saving lives or preventing hysterectomy . " <p> She said the results show that of the women given tranexamic acid within three hours , 89 died from bleeding compared with 127 given placebo ( in addition to standard care ) . The researchers found no side effects from the drug for either mothers or babies . These findings provide the first comprehensive evidence on using tranexamic acid for post-partum haemorrhage and suggest it should be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tranexamic acid was invented in the 1960s by a Japanese husband and wife research team , Shosuke and Utako Okamoto . <p> It is important to mention that almost all of the deaths from postpartum haemorrhage are in low-and middle-income countries . Although giving birth in a healthcare facility increases the chance of surviving post-partum haemorrhage , women still die from the condition even within hospitals . <p> While the WOMAN Trial found that tranexamic acid significantly reduced death due to bleeding , it did not prevent hysterectomy , reveals the study . The researchers say this is because in low-and middle-income countries where blood supplies are limited , a hysterectomy is sometimes carried out immediately after the onset of very severe postpartum haemorrhage to save the mother 's life . This means there is no time for tranexamic acid to have an effect . <p> The study builds on previous research involving 20,000 trauma patients , which showed that tranexamic reduced deaths due to bleeding by almost a third if given within three hours . <p> Current World Health Organisation guidelines , based on the previous trauma research , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a subsequent treatment option if uterotonics ( drugs to induce contractions ) fail to control the bleeding , or if the bleeding is thought to be due to trauma . <p> Post-partum haemorrhage is defined as a blood loss of more than 500ml within 24 hours of giving birth , explained Professor Rizwana.

It is a rich-man's-slum where some of the most influential people of the country have defeated the poor at their game . Even a cursory glance at this area can reveal how Pakistani state and society works . <p> The zoning laws of the Capital Development Authority ( CDA ) forbid any construction in this area . There are added restrictions because it is too close to Rawal Lake and housing in this area can contaminate water in the lake -- water that is the lifeline for the residents of Rawalpindi . <p> Mohsin-e-Pakistan , Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan , was the first to grace this place with his presence . He built a house overlooking the lake in 1992 . The CDA moved its bulldozers but gave up after some huffing and puffing as the nation and its media stood united behind their hero . After all , the man who gave us the bomb had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . The nation was not aware at that time that their hero had already extended this logic a bit too far . <p> A decade later , another benefactor of the nation , Imran Khan arrived on the scene and built his mansion on the top of a hill comprising 300 kanals of land . His presence proved a game changer as it gave a brand name to this place . Within no time , a whole illegal settlement took shape around his house . <p> My friends living in the area may feel cross that I am repeatedly using the word slum for their posh locality . It is a ' slum ' because all constructions in this area have been made in violation of the capital 's Master Plan ; the buildings and streets follow no pattern or blueprint ; there is no running water , piped gas is not available to most houses and the residents have to arrange their own transformers to get electricity . <p> The CDA submitted a report in the Supreme Court last week stating that 122 buildings , including the residence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in violation of the ICT Zoning Regulation 1992 and they needed to be demolished . <p> While hearing the case , Justice Umar Ata Bandial remarked that the court could not order the demolition of 200 houses . The court also questioned what the Capital Development Authority ( CDA ) and Islamabad Capital Authority ( ICT ) had been doing while illegal construction continued in Bani Gala . <p> Bani Gala has followed a familiar pattern followed by slum dwellers all over the world . They try to give the state a fate accompli by inhabiting a large area in collusion with government officials while relevant institutions remain ' unaware ' . Evicting hundreds or thousands of poor from their shelters can be an unpopular and politically expensive step for any government . As a result , the state has to reconcile with it in one way or the other . In Pakistan , many such settlements are regularised and some basic amenities are reluctantly extended to residents . <p> However , the state can be harsh when it wants to . In 2015 , a slum in Islamabad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground despite protests by residents and human rights activists . This place had housed more than 2,000 families for decades . In 2002 , the CDA forced residents of the Sri Saral village to vacate their houses to make way for construction of the D-12 sector . When villagers resisted , police killed two protesters and registered an FIR against more than 430 villagers , including women , on charges of killing their own men , abducting policemen , inciting violence and abetting terrorism . <p> The people displaced from Tarbela were not fully compensated till 2003 , some 25 years after the dam was completed . And even then the final settlements were not made out of a sense of justice or love for the people who had sacrificed everything for this project , but because of a World Bank conditionality , which demanded payment of compensation money to over 1,700 families as a precondition of the $350 million loan for the Ghazi Barotha Hydropower project . Also due to a World Bank conditionality , Ghazi Barotha became the first large-scale project in the country through which people were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been completed , NAB arrested a number of affectees for taking more money from the state than they deserved . I am not aware of what happened to them . Perhaps , they joined the Q-League and everything was settled . <p> Bani Gala is no Sri Saral or Ghazi Barotha . It is a land of heroes . The wealth created by heroes through such illegal activity can be mindboggling . Imran Khan bought this property for Rs50 million . Today , a kanal of land in the area is worth Rs7 million . That makes his total property here worth almost Rs2,100 million . Ironically , this is almost equal to the worth of the controversial apartments owned by the Sharif family in London . This escalation in prices has mainly resulted from illegally converting a non-residential area into a residential area through sheer force of personal influence . <p> Something similar was done by the Sharifs in Jati Umra when they acquired land at throwaway prices in the 1990s and developed the area at the cost of the state . I remember the public mood in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Multan Development Authority ( MDA ) was diverted to building the Raiwind Road that passes in front of the Jati Umra estate . Just as rich people in Sri Saral learnt to make sacrifices for their poor brothers and sisters now living in Sector D12 , the rich people of Southern Punjab have also learnt to make sacrifices for their poor brothers and sisters in Lahore . <p> Islamabad enjoys another unique distinction in the capitals of the world . Here , hundreds of the most influential persons of the country double as vegetable farmers . In more blunt terms , they live in mansions that have been leased out as vegetable farms . Another national hero , Pervez Musharraf , owns one such farm where he lived for a short period before fleeing from justice . <p> In 2011 , the Supreme Court took notice of the illegal use of farms and the CDA started ' action ' against them . We have n't heard much on the topic ever since . Clearly , how can hundreds of mansions worth billions of dollars be razed to grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often tell me with moist eyes that Imran Khan has sacrificed everything he had for the nation . Maybe he should donate this land to the nation for extension of the nearby botanical garden which has been severely impacted due to development here . <p> As far the case is concerned , I totally agree with my lord that two hundred houses can not be razed . How can we allow a government department to raze two hundred houses in a slum ?

Beyond our borders with Afghanistan , India and Iran , the Saudi-led alliance 's growing anti-Iranian posture requires utmost attention and deft handling . After having committed its military and advisory resources to the alliance , Islamabad 's options are becoming narrower by the day , especially as Washington brings its own containment plans on the agenda of the alliance . <p> Then there is China . The productivity of Beijing 's engagement with Pakistan depends on Islamabad 's internal stability and a balance in its bilateral ties with all its neighbours . That can only be achieved if the army works in tandem with a functional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mutuality of Pak-China interests . Neither country can afford it . We certainly ca n't . <p> Internally , small-scale yet crucial operations in agencies like Kurram and the challenge of winding up the unfinished work of the Raheel Sharif era require a totally smooth functional relationship at all levels of policy formulation . Operation Raddul Fasaad 's potency and the National Action Plan 's centrality to the country 's long-term interests are both tied to uniformity of outlook between the civilian and army leadership . The Friday attack on a JUI-F leader 's convoy in Mastung , Balochistan indicates the winding road that lies ahead for Pakistan 's effort for internal stability . <p> Seen dispassionately , these positives have only an incidental link with the political interests of the Nawaz Sharif government . India , Afghanistan , Iran , Washington , the Gulf tensions , the war against terror are enduring issues . These issues go beyond individuals in power now ; they stretch way into the future . Disharmony , friction or outright collapse of the equation between the army and civilian leaders , present or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Pakistan 's ill-wishers . The only loser in case of dysfunctionality in civil-military ties will be Pakistan . Those who insist on seeing the drama-less denouement of Dawn leaks in the Nawaz-Gen Qamar context are blind to reason . Their ignorance or ill-will is profoundly detrimental to Pakistan 's strategic interests . <p> These positives aside , this controversy , and its particularly unsavoury bent in the last three weeks , has other dimensions that can not be ignored just because the issue has been resolved . <p> One aspect concerns state-level communication -- not personal but institutional . For all the rhetoric about the need for both sides to be on the same page , there has been little or no effort to have the communication methodology sorted out . The larger burden of responsibility lies on the shoulders of the Sharif government , which is in charge of all the platforms of institutionalised communication . This is the third time it is in power . It has dealt with seven army chiefs . Its leadership has cut their political teeth during the Zia era . They ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decision-making process that takes in the army 's input without creating either a crisis of authority or of mutual confidence . <p> The Dawn leaks saga has highlighted how little the Sharif government has learnt about the value of the institutionalisation of interaction with the army . It continues to skate on the thin ice of bare minimum mutual trust . Its first instinct is to pander to the military high command ; its second instinct is to cry foul and play the victim . In countries with complex histories , such as Pakistan , this is a recipe for disasters . If one is averted , it does not mean another one wo n't strike any time soon . <p> For the army , the communication side of its institutional functioning is no less crucial . For years , the army has been talking only to itself , and in an efficient way , but has not developed any workable module to engage its civilian counterparts . The overly simple and , at times , misleading theory of civilian incompetence has spawned a culture of contempt , triggering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence of this strategy bearing any useful national fruit ; it has served narrow personal interests , though , such as Raheel Sharif 's inflated image of a saviour , which he then cashed by landing a job in Saudi Arabia . <p> Other than that , the army suffers the tremors of a constant tug of war with the civilians . It gets sucked into situations it has no control over and is made to carry crosses it can not lift . From showing pictures of meetings to budget allocation to dealing with defence challenges , everything is a manoeuvre to show how the brass outshines the waistcoat . This is exhausting . Expending national energies on trivial pursuits is meaningless . The army remains a formidable force . It enjoys national prestige . It is indispensible to national defence . These facts ensure the army a special place on the table of power . <p> Constitutionalists ( and I dare put myself in that category ) still have a long way to win the argument against the contextualists who treat the reality of the army 's preponderance as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If that is the case , what is the problem then ? Why project and exhibit power needlessly ? What does it achieve in the end ? What did Gen Raheel Sharif achieve ? Or Gen Musharraf for that matter ?

If Pakistan is to function like a modern state the battle of the institutions must end . <p> But be sure that this battle will perpetuate as long as traffickers of scandals and purveyors of chaos continue to operate with impunity . When the DG ISPR 's tweet came out , a vast group of politicians , mediapersons , and anchors declared early Christmas . They put celebratory drinks on ice and started to dance to welcome the beginning of the end of another civilian government . That one tweet could set off a tsunami of wild joy tells how shameless this tribe has become . Praises were showered on the chief of army staff and the DG ISPR was promoted to the media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their plea was clear : the PM must resign because the army has rejected its take on Dawn leaks . This stampede that trampled on reality and flattened all cannons of the constitution raged for well after the tweet . <p> And then came May 10 . The resolution ( by no means ideal ) of the tweet issue returned the system to its normal functioning , but for the dance party this was no less than 9/11 . They mourned and wailed , bleated and cursed . They ridiculed the very institution that they had said a few days ago was the ultimate guarantor of Pakistan as a sovereign state . One drew parallels between the 1971 militant debacle and the withdrawal of the tweet ; another cut cruel jokes about the weakness of the GHQ . Yet another said the army could not fight India and a few openly alleged ' deal ' . Aitzaz Ahsan wanted the DG ISPR to resign and Imran Khan stoked suspicions that the issue had been resolved on account of some underhand and shady understanding and therefore demanded explanations . <p> We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opponent 's disadvantage so the PTI and PPP 's take on the resolution was n't unexpected . However , the foul campaign on social media against the army leadership was unbelievable . Ironically , almost all of these so-called critics either belonged to the establishment 's media assets or were retired servicemen . Both these categories never tire of claiming abiding love for the army and faking super-patriotism . That they turned on the army showed prompting , deliberate agenda and mal-intent that went beyond degrading the Dawn leaks issue . It seemed directed at perpetuating the civil-military divide . <p> The same group had urged the army to take over during the first PTI dharna . The same combination of analysts and politicos were active during the second dharna . They are precisely those who expected the judiciary to clash violently with the executive , and goad the army to ' take charge of the situation . ' They play a dangerous game .

@@18439233 <h> add The News to homescreen <h> Opinion <h> Share <h> Yadav and the ICJ <p> " A lie gets halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to put its shoes on " . The saying goes something like that -- though different versions are attributed to different people . <p> Information , for better or for worse , has an inherent capacity to be taken out of context and moulded to fit whatever paradigm a state is trying to develop . Pakistan , due to its limited understanding and capacity with regard to international law , is often unable to comprehend the significance of such information in the international sphere . India , however , has been building its legal capacity to utilise international law to its strategic advantage . The Indian spin on the International Court of Justice ( ICJ ) ' s " pre-provisional " measure illustrates exactly that . <p> India and Pakistan find themselves embroiled in some form of hostility or conflict quite often . Perhaps , this is why both states have intentionally ousted the ICJ 's jurisdiction with regard to the contentious cases between themselves or other members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India 's declarations under Article 36(2) of the ICJ statute . It is because of this exclusion of the ICJ 's jurisdiction in contentious cases that India has taken the Article 36(1) route . <p> Both India and Pakistan are states parties to the Optional Protocol of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations 1963 . Article I of this protocol stipulates that : " disputes arising out of the interpretation or application of the Convention shall lie within the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice and may accordingly be brought before the court by an application made by any party to the dispute being a party to the present protocol " . It is under this provision that India has invoked the jurisdiction of the ICJ with regard to Kulbhushan Yadav 's case . <p> Accordingly , Article 36(1) of the ICJ statute clearly states that : " the jurisdiction of the court comprises all cases which the parties refer to it and all matters specially provided for in the Charter of the United Nations or in treaties and conventions in force " . At this stage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the court will most certainly assume jurisdiction . This is particularly important considering India 's claims that it has " won " against Pakistan , presenting some sort of illusion that it has argued at a stage of proceedings . <p> In reality , only a generic , routine statement has been issued by the president of the ICJ . If one is to review the case law in this regard , it becomes clear that the statement issued by the president of the court is not a stay order but a request to maintain the status quo . This request has not only been directed at Pakistan but also at India . It is a mere statement to the effect that both parties maintain the status quo -- nothing more and nothing less . <p> The assumption of jurisdiction by the ICJ has yet to be seen . Once an application is filed , there is a customary " oral hearing " -- in fact , there may be a single or multiple hearings depending on each state 's legal strategy . This oral hearing is awaited and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties for the oral hearing , there is no provisional measure that can be granted . Pakistan has only recently received notice . Therefore , to state that provisional measures have already been granted is entirely baseless and factually incorrect . <p> In the event that the ICJ does assume jurisdiction -- which is not entirely unlikely considering precedent in this area -- this may not be as awful for Pakistan as the Indian media would have us believe . The fact is that Yadav confessed to not only sabotage but much more than that . He was tried and convicted in accordance with domestic law and his sentence is a culmination of those lawful proceedings . Pakistan 's case against Yadav has more merit than India 's case in this regard . Having said that , regardless of the outcome -- or whatever fears we may have in appearing before the ICJ -- it can not be emphasised enough that Pakistan must fully participate at all stages of the proceedings . <p> What many are neglecting is the fact that Pakistan and India have , between themselves , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly provides for the denial of consular access and assistance in cases where national security is concerned . It can be argued that India has voluntarily , through a bilateral agreement with Pakistan , committed itself to the provisions contained within the 2008 agreement . As per the international legal principle of pacta sunt servanda , India must honour and keep its agreements . The fact that Yadav was not an ordinary Indian citizen or an ordinary Indian diplomat is key in Pakistan 's arguments before the court . That is the crux of our national interest ground and must be maintained throughout . <p> In any case , even if the case proceeds and a judgment is secured against Pakistan , we should be aware of existing precedent before the ICJ and how various states have reacted in the event that provisional measures have been issued by the court and those states have refused to comply with them by citing domestic law as a justification . <p> The LaGrand case , a case between Germany and the US which was brought before the court , concerned temporary court orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to halt the execution of two German nationals -- the LaGrand brothers -- who had attempted an armed bank robbery in Arizona . The US executed both brothers in spite of the fact that the ICJ had issued provisional measures , which it deemed to be binding . The argument put forward by the US was that the Vienna Convention 1963 does not grant rights to individuals . Instead , it accords these rights to states . In this regard , Pakistan too can argue that the ICJ can not be turned into a court of criminal appeal -- particularly where matters of sovereignty and national security are concerned .

Back then , Iran had threatened to enter Pakistani territory to free the hostages , but then they were released apparently after a ransom deal . <p> The military control of Iranian affairs can also be gauged by the fact that Iran 's defence minister is General Hussain Dehqan who reiterated his resolve to strike back at Pakistan .

However , India 's so-called peaceful nuclear explosion in 1974 not only heightened those concerns , but also generated grave fears regarding the spread of fissionable materials and weapons-applicable nuclear technology to other non-NPT states . This was the first time that a country chose to secretly use imported civilian nuclear technology for military purposes . <p> India 's 1974 test reflected a deliberate failure on the part of the Indian government to separate its military and civilian programmes . And this failure continues to be a prevalent problem to this day . During the late 1970s , several nuclear experts expressed apprehensions that India 's nuclear test could trigger a series of mini-nuclear arms races in different parts of the world . In 1976 , William Epstein , a Canadian international civil servant and expert on disarmament , stated that : " For the first time in a quarter of a century of working with the problems of the arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scared " . <p> India 's pursuit of nuclear capability left Pakistan with no option but to focus its meagre resources on nuclear weapons while its people continued to starve . Furthermore , Pakistan 's development of nuclear capability strengthened the military 's domestic political role , laying the ground for the existing imbalance in civil-military relations . If there is a reason why millions of children in both Pakistan and India are growing up in abject poverty , it is because the decision-making processes in both countries have been held hostage to wildly irrational patriotism and the people are too ignorant to figure out the politics of this whole situation . <p> In May 1998 , India declared itself a nuclear weapons state by conducting five underground nuclear tests in the Pokhran Range in the Rajasthan Desert . May 11 , 2017 marks the nineteenth anniversary of the 1998 Pokhran-II nuclear tests . The nuclear tests provoked widespread condemnation and renewed security concerns in the region , prompting Pakistan to carry out its own tests less than three weeks later .

Many Indian scholars argue that national security concerns were the primary motives underlying India 's pursuit of nuclear weapons . But there is a consensus among US strategic experts , like Scott Sagan , that domestic politics and the symbolic importance of nuclear weapons were the dominant factors driving the role of the Indian nuclear and missile establishment at that point in time . In my articles published in these pages , I have argued at length that national security concerns can hardly be a logical reason to explain India 's decision to go nuclear .

The dangers of miscalculation or accident have made escalating a small conflict into a full-scale nuclear war a real possibility . Both states continue to engage in an unstoppable nuclear arms race , raising international concerns about the future of regional security . However , paranoid leaders on both sides of the border remain largely oblivious to this fact . <p> Over the past one-and-a-half decade , both neighbours have adopted offensive military postures , unveiling military strategies like the new Cold Start doctrine and the use of tactical nuclear weapons .

The bill empowers the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan to regulate the notorious real-estate sector , which is one of the largest components of the black economy .

This was obviously spurred by the political controversy caused by the Panama Papers leaks .

In fact , it has reached levels where they are just gossip scandals to be shared on videos that are quickly overtaken by hundreds of other videos showing the latest affair or divorce of a celebrity . Bomb blasts are a common occurrence and will only be noticed for more than a few hours if the number of deaths exceed 20 . Anything less is tolerable and forgettable .

And it takes the shocking murder of Mashal Khan to wake up the society , the police to set up an inquiry and the Supreme Court to issue a suo-motu notice .

@@18914236 <p> Let 's put the June 8 UK general election in perspective . If Theresa May had n't called the snap election , she could have remained prime minister and the Conservative ( or Tory ) Party , which she leads , could have retained its majority in Parliament until 2020 . But Theresa was misled by the polls , which , until we got dangerously close to the election , portrayed her as a popular leader with a commanding lead over her rivals , particularly Jeremy Corbyn , the leader of the main opposition Labour Party . <p> In contrast to Theresa , Corbyn was presented by the media as a basket case , struggling to keep the nearly defunct Labour Party alive . It was in this context that May thought she could increase her majority in Parliament and thus enter Brexit ( Britain 's recent decision to leave the European Union ) negotiations with a convincing mandate from the British people . <p> Not only did that not happen , but May lost her outright majority in Parliament with Labour gaining 29 extra seats , and is now struggling to form a coalition government with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an epic blunder , summarised most succinctly when ex-English footballer Gary Lineker tweeted , " I think Theresa May has won own goal of the season . " <p> It was the second time , in rapid succession , that the Tory Party leadership seemed utterly foolish . Last June , May 's predecessor , David Cameron , wagered the country 's future by asking voters to decide , in a referendum , whether or not the UK should remain a part of the European Union . Betting that the result would be in the affirmative , Cameron had to resign when voters narrowly opted to leave the union . <p> Ironically , the Conservatives lost some seats to Labour because those who wanted to remain in the European Union punished the Tories for calling such an ill-thought-out referendum . This , in spite of the fact that positions on Brexit were n't exactly drawn on party lines , with Theresa initially for remaining in the union and Corbyn sympathising with those who wanted to leave . <p> Nevertheless , May 's miscalculation has benefited her rival , Corbyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by many within his party , he has managed to come out looking like a winner . While May has lost legitimacy as the leader of her party and may soon be ousted , Corbyn has solidified his position and is poised to lead the Labour Party in the wake of its improved electoral performance . <p> While May led an abysmal campaign , poor in her media interactions , awkward among the voters , leading one to wonder how on earth she became a politician in the first place , Corbyn shined as an authentic candidate , a man of principle and integrity , a true rarity among politicians in any country . May 's flip-flops and U-turns appeared jaded and fake compared to Corbyn 's history of speaking truth to power . His introspective foreign policy positions are a breath of fresh air for the leader of any Western country even if his economic prescriptions may be untenable and wishful . <p> Young people came out in record numbers to vote for Jeremy as he promised scrapping university tuition fees and increasing minimum wage . This is understandably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay for those freebies may continue to cause many older voters to shy away from voting for him . <p> And thus for all those hailing Jeremy 's impressive rise within the Labour Party as a return to true left-wing politics and the end of " Labour-lite under Blair , " as some put it , it remains to be seen whether Labour can actually win the election under Corbyn , as opposed to just denting the Tory majority . Continually failing to form government may not necessarily mean that " politics has changed for good , " as Jeremy stated on election night . Let 's also not forget that in neighbouring France , the left-wing Francois Hollande was recently replaced by the centrist Emmanuel Macron.

The famous ' Tank man ' at the Tiananmen Square in China , Che Guevara under captivity , or Albert Einstein sticking out his tongue way before it became a party symbol in the modern culture reflect a deeper underlying message of resistance . In a way , a simple picture can prove to be a potent political statement against the status quo , resonating with billions of people around the world . <p> Perhaps that was the intention of whoever leaked the recent picture of Hussain Nawaz siting on a chair in front of the JIT -- to ignite a storm of emotions that eventually would translate into a movement either wrapping up the entire JIT together with the Panama case , or embarrassing the prime minister 's family and settling scores . <p> Unfortunately , the picture of prime minister 's son however way one may like to twist it falls short on delivering anything for either of the parties . <p> For one , the picture is meaningless in terms of the power of its content . Without the additional spins to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it proves nothing beyond the fact that a prime minister 's son is sitting on a chair responding to the JIT 's questions . <p> Second , the picture does n't give a clear verdict .

The PML-N quarters have tried hard to force a story and emotions into the picture , but without handcuffs or the PM 's son forced to sit on the floor , it 's a hard sell beyond the PML-N 's vote bank . <p> If , on the other hand , the leak is from the establishment quarters as it is being alleged , it is even a bigger failure . First , there is absolutely nothing embarrassing in the picture of the PM 's son sitting on a chair facing the trial .

PHOTO : AFP <p> Education , much like everything else in the field ofhuman knowledge , is rooted to philosophy . The curriculum texts , teaching pedagogies and school structures all reflect a particularphilosophical premise . <p> Be it the idealist school or the existentialist one , the pragmatist theorists or those who seek to use education for social change in the critical paradigm , education is about ' wide-awakeness ' . Today in education , a crucial issue facing us is the need to find ways of educating young persons to sensitivity , potency , social consciousness and a healthy citizenship ethos . <p> In my journey so far as a teacher , I have been particularly impressed with three schools of philosophy : the idealist , pragmatist , and critical schools of education . <p> The idealist school believes that reality already exists in the way that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal advantage , but it should be pursued for benefitting the whole of humanity . It is the teachers who become the models of truth in this perspective . Here learning is , in the last analysis , the realisation of good and truth . For idealists , the human spirit is the link between physical reality and the idealist design . Education , therefore , must ' convert original nature into spiritual nature ' . <p> Idealists posit that the knowledge acquired through creativity and analysis is more important than sensory knowledge . Therefore , education should lead to a harmony being established between the self and the universal self . <p> Here , I would like to cite the school established by Rabindranath Tagore , one of my favourite Indian authors , in Bengal . Tagore worked endlessly to evoke among his students a sense of complete harmony with the universe , where education was both a source of moral elevation and freedom of spirit . <p> Pakistani students need this exposure to education more than ever today .

Pragmatist educators are moderators of learning . Here , as John Dewey , the architect behind America 's educational reforms emphasised , <p> The pragmatist school is centred on students and encourages them to embark on discovery journeys of their own . Consequently , scientific inquiry becomes important and is prized for the ends it can achieve . For pragmatists , education has an end and nothing is important for its own sake . <p> Many schools in Pakistan are living examples of this philosophy . Tests in these schools are designed to measure thinking and application of ideas . They have field trips as a vital part of student co-curricular activities and these are taken to be adding valuable exposure to a student 's experience of the world . <p> Towards the very last , I would like to talk about the critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me in a very different plain of thought where I began to take my teaching profession and holistic education in a completely different light . Since critical theorists engage in deconstruction , I started to engage in the deconstruction of my whole educational experience so far , both as a teacher and a student . <p> This reflection then formed the basis of an educational design , where the social context of oppression comes to play a defining role . History becomes fused with the present and the two combine to paint a picture of the totality of future , where every act of oppression and the counter act to fight it lead to a dialectical unfolding of events . <p> Now I believe that teachers can then never be insulated from political activism . Rather , they should be made responsible for sowing the seeds of discontent in the hearts and minds of their students against the oppression that society unleashes on the marginalised and the insignificant . <p> Schools of the global South , the global marginalised , the global oppressed need this type of education to transform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have the audacity to pine for a different future and hope for a far more equal world than the one we are in possession of at the moment . <p> A former sub-editor at The Express Tribune , college teacher of Sociology and English Language and a graduate student at Aga Khan Institute for Educational Development , who leans toward the left side of the political spectrum and looks for ideas for his short stories and poems in the everyday happenings of life .

In December 1980 the news of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan was immediately followed by news commentaries and analysis about " Soviet designs " in Balochistan .

Many more news and comments appeared in the press on the subject throughout the 1980s . <p> This line of reasoning was used as one of the main justifications for supporting an armed Afghan resistance against the Soviet invasion . Pakistan has been blaming Afghanistan and India for supporting Baloch nationalists fighting for separation from Pakistan while the western and eastern neighbours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact the Narendra Modi government in India has taken a public position on supporting Baloch separatism after the deterioration of relations between the two neighboring countries . <p> Hostile intelligence agencies of the other states might be playing tit-for-tat games with Pakistan or following their own agendas for destabilising Pakistan .

When Saudi-led and US and Israeli supported anti-Iran coalition talk about taking the war into Iran , they may be thinking of opening three fronts . The first front is sectarian that implies using the Shia-Sunni divide in a predominantly Shia country where the Sunni population faces discrimination at the hands of theocratic government dominated by Shia clergy . The second one is ethnic where alienation among non-Persian ethnic groups such as Arabs , Kurds , Baloch , Azeris , Turkamens and other minorities can be used for destabilizing Iran .

There is consensus among experts that the majority of Baloch people live in Balochistan province of Pakistan , although they are there in Iranian Siestan-Balochistan and western provinces of Afghanistan like Neemroz , Farah and in some other areas .

Actually some Baloch nationalists challenge the name Persian Gulf or Arab Gulf because from Karachi to Chahbahar and beyond the coastline is mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name for the area would be Baloch Gulf ! <p> If past experience is anything to go by , Saudi money is expected to go to hardcore Sunni extremists . As pointed out earlier there are anti-Shia Sunni extremist/anti-Iran organisations active in Balochistan . Even Jamaat-ud-Dawa ( the new name of proscribed Lashkar-e-Taiba ) is openly working in Balochistan for " safeguarding the country 's integrity " . Money pouring in from Gulf countries to religious seminaries and mosques has helped the expansion of Salfism and Wahabism among the aforementioned Sunni extremists . Unfortunately promoting religious extremism and militancy has been regarded as a " nation building " strategy in post Zia-ul-Haq Pakistan by the military dominated Punjabi ruling elites . This strategy is expected to weaken if not completely deconstruct ethnic and historical identities that are the basis for the demands for federalism and provincial autonomy . Project Taliban focuses on Pashtuns . But there are also similar strategies for Baloch and Sindhis . The Baloch youth from the Brahvi speaking belt who are recruited in LeJ are killing Shias but they can also be unleashed on Baloch nationalists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The combination of Saudi money with Pakistani " nation building " can be lethal not only for Balochistan but also for the entire region . <p> But then the Iranians will also not be sitting idle . They are capable of reaching out to Baloch separatists on the Pakistani side and they will not be alone in it . India is already publicly committed to support Baloch separatism . An antagonizsed Afghanistan can team up with them . With the induction of so many players Balochistan , which is already bleeding , can become a hell . The ensuing bloodshed can take Baloch , a comparatively small population , to the verge of extinction . But what will be the future of CPEC in such a situation ? Will Pakistan only depend on the policy of " shooting our way through " ( as she did in East Pakistan ) or adopt some political sophistication for finding political solutions ? PM Nawaz Sharif has simply forgotten the promise he made on December 24 , 2014 for convening an APC on Balochistan . But at the moment he is in survival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

What a Salman does to my films is that he gives it a certain reach all across the world that a smaller star would not be able to give . <p> Q : What do you think you bring to Salman 's filmography ? <p> A : I would like to believe that I have brought to his filmography a certain sense of coherence in the characters he is playing . ( There is ) a certain consistency of characters where the same character will not do everything that is in the list book of commercial cinema -- he will only do things that his character will allow . That is something audiences are enjoying and that is why ' Bajrangi ' is his biggest film to date by miles . They enjoyed the consistency of the character and I 'd like to believe that 's my contribution . <p> Q : Salman 's fan base is a mystery to a lot of us ... <p> A : ( Interjects ) It is a mystery to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you keep them in mind when you are making a film with Salman Khan ? Are there dos and don'ts ? <p> A : I 'll tell you honestly . We do n't keep them in mind because then ( you ) do things for people you do n't know . The only person you know is yourself and I believe you have to make a film that you will enjoy watching and then cross your fingers that a larger number of people identify with your vision . If you start succumbing to the pressure of what a star image is , you wo n't evolve . For example , if I had given in to the pressure of making an action film with Salman ( after " Ek Tha Tiger " ) , it would have been a safer bet to make another action film with him . <p> But action was out of my system and I did n't want to make another action film with him . We took him into a world he has never been in . At that point , everyone said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they expect him to beat up people , not to get beaten up , that too by Pakistani police officers . " That was the biggest taboo , but we did it and the audiences lapped it up . By not succumbing to pressure , we did something that turned out better for us . <p> Q : You may not consider the fans , but does Salman Khan have any checklist -- things he will or wo n't do in films ? <p> A : In our first film together he did . He would say , " Kabir , my people expect this and we should do this . " But that changed rapidly . And after ' Bajrangi ' , it never came up . ' Bajrangi ' was one of those films that did well but also got a lot of love . I do n't know whether we 'll ever get that kind of love again . And that is because people accepted his character for what it was ... I believe in " Tubelight " , it will be the same -- they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You started off as a documentary film-maker but have gone on to make some of India 's most successful mainstream films . Do you think you 'll go back to documentary filmmaking ? <p> A : I might . People laugh at this , but ultimately , we are all storytellers and we get our stories from our life experiences . All my life experiences have come from my documentaries . So if I run out of raw material , I might go back ( Laughs ) . It is also the thrill of working with one or two people rather than an invading army that you take when you make a mainstream film . I am still that documentary filmmaker who came to Mumbai to make that one film and go back . Everything else that has happened should be a bonus .

" But , the reality is that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Eight pipeline operators contacted by Reuters for this story declined to comment on their discounted spot pricing or the secondary market for pipeline capacity . <p> Some of those pipeline firms are offering prices as low as 25 percent of federally regulated rates , creating a secondary market that undercuts shippers with long-term contracts , according to four sources at companies that regularly ship on the pipelines . <p> The discounts emerged after a global glut and crashing oil prices caused many shippers to let their pipeline contracts lapse or declare bankruptcy . <p> More than a dozen producers , traders and refiners told Reuters they were angry and frustrated that these discount deals have become a mainstay . They declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly . <p> The contract and regulatory framework of the industry makes it difficult for them to bargain down their own long-term contracts , leaving them paying more for the pipeline space than occasional shippers competing to send oil through the same lines . <p> This gives the occasional shippers the edge in delivering cheaper crude to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The industry downturn since 2014 has reduced demand from occasional shippers to use the line at that price . <p> Earlier this year , TransCanada 's marketing arm offered customers the right to send crude through the line at a tariff of between 80 to 90 cents , traders using the line said . <p> At the end of 2016 , the rate offered was as low 30 to 40 cents . Even with the discounts , the line rarely reached 70 percent capacity . <p> TransCanada declined to comment . <p> Pipeline operators agree to charge specific tariffs for sending oil through the lines when they sign long-term contracts with oil shippers . <p> Those rates are known as committed tariffs , and are subject to approval by the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ( FERC ) . The FERC also reviews the rates paid by occasional shippers , known as uncommitted tariffs . <p> The FERC declined to comment on the secondary market and on the tariffs that the marketing arms of pipeline operators are charging in that market . <p> Most of the 10 largest US pipeline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have established their own marketing or trading arms that are reselling space . <p> Last year , TransCanada - which operates the massive Keystone pipeline system - became the most recent player to open a unit to trade oil and resell pipeline space . <p> A few , such as Plains , have had marketing arms for more than a decade , but in the past they had mostly just sold or traded space that went unused by major producers who had committed to long-term contracts . <p> On lines such as TransCanada 's , big producers such as ExxonMobil and Suncor Energy account for up to 90 percent of the flow in a pipeline . The remaining 10 percent is sold to occasional shippers . <p> Suncor and ExxonMobil declined to comment . <p> With the three-year rout in oil , the volume accounted for in long-term contracts has fallen , and the marketing arms have gone from simply selling occasional space to needing to make big deals to fill the lines . <p> The practice has become so widespread that even pipeline operators who had previously said they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fray . <p> Magellan Midstream Partners , for instance , in November applied to the FERC to establish a marketing arm , citing the more favorable terms other firms can offer customers . The move came after Magellan had declined for years to run its own operation out of fear that it would compete with its own customers . <p> The secondary market is formed by marketing firms signing up to long-term contracts with their parent companies , the pipeline owners . The marketing firms become like committed customers to the line , and pay the same rates for the space as the firms with long-term contracts . Those marketing firms book a paper loss for shipping the volumes at a discount . But the sales keep the pipelines more full - which makes the parent firm look better to investors , who use pipeline volume as a key metric to judge those firms .

Despite my name not being mentioned in the Supreme Court 's order in the Panamagate case , I appeared before the JIT and paid the debt I did not owe , " she said . <p> In an apparent contradiction to Maryam 's statement , the top court has mentioned her as respondent number six in its order in the Panamagate case dated April 20 . <p> Maryam alleged that the JIT was working to " find an excuse against the PM to frame him " . <p> " The questions the JIT asked me are about our family business and my deceased grandfather .

@@19357240 <h> add The News to homescreen <h> Opinion <h> Share <p> Advertisement <h> Why Hindutva loves Israel <p> With Narendra Modi 's ' groundbreaking visit ' to Israel , India seems to have traversed the distance of 70 years and bypassed a long history of standing by the dispossessed Palestinians in the blink of an eye . As a beaming and effusive Netanyahu put it , after hugging the guest for the sixth time , Israel has been waiting for this moment for 70 years . And who better to accomplish this task than the man who has made a tradition of breaking with all hallowed traditions ? <p> With his eventful past , it is but natural that Modi should enjoy the distinction of becoming the first Indian leader to visit Israel , overturning the historical policy of solidarity with Palestinians . <p> Long before Israel was carved out of Palestinian land , leaders of India 's freedom movement batted for the Palestinians . As early as November 26 , 1938 , when Western powers were laying the groundwork for Israel , Gandhi wrote in his journal Harijan : " My sympathies are all with the Jews . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these friends I came to learn much of their age-long persecution . But my sympathy does not blind me to the requirements of justice . The cry for the national home for the Jews does not make much appeal to me . The sanction for it is sought in the Bible and the tenacity with which the Jews have hankered after return to Palestine . <p> " Why should they not , like other peoples of the earth , make that country their home where they are born and where they earn their livelihood ? Palestine belongs to the Arabs in the same sense that England belongs to the English or France to the French . It is wrong and inhuman to impose the Jews on the Arabs . What 's going on in Palestine today can not be justified by any moral code of conduct . " <p> Although Israel soon became a reality , India continued this unequivocal support for the Palestinians under Nehru and even under his daughter Indira Gandhi till her assassination in 1984 . Owing to this vocal support , Yasser Arafat used to frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pakistan . Few may know that Nehru even travelled to Gaza in 1960 to visit Indian and UN troops based in the Gaza Strip and also as a gesture of solidarity with the Palestinians . <p> All that is history now . Under Modi , India could n't be a more different country . The world has moved on . Today , the secular , socialist and democratic republic of Gandhi and Nehru has never been closer to the Zionist , apartheid Israel . <p> Under Modi , India has given an elaborate burial to the policy of paying lip service to the Palestinian cause . Since India established full diplomatic relations with Israel under Narasimha Rao in 1992 , Delhi has tried to strike a semblance of balance between romancing Tel Aviv and keeping the Palestinians in good humour with perfunctory visits to the Palestinian side . Modi is breaking away with that tradition by skipping Ramallah as a message to his hardline constituency back home . <p> Having visited some Gulf states in the past few years and establishing a good rapport with their leaders , he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Israel is too important right now to fuss over such diplomatic niceties . Of course , there is an economic and strategic side to this relationship . Eyeing the world power status , India has been on an unprecedented shopping spree for the world 's finest and fiercest weapons . Indeed , the Gandhian nation is the world 's largest importer of arms right now , even though nearly half of its population still struggles below poverty line and yearns for the basics like water , healthcare , education and electricity . <p> Israel has been one of India 's largest suppliers of arms -- many of them US-made and provided with the help of the US taxpayers ' money -- after Russia and the US . Of course , Washington looks the other way . Thanks to those exports to India , Israel has been earning more than a $1 billion annually in addition to the vast military and economic aid that it receives from the US . Israel offered arms as well as strategic expertise during India 's wars with Pakistan -- and not just in Kargil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian forces and intelligence agencies in fighting ' Islamic militancy ' , given their vast experience of ' dealing ' with the Palestinians . Over the years , visits by top Indian security and intelligence officials as well as their political masters to Israel have been frequent and are hardly a secret . <p> It 's not just the elite of the security establishment who have been besotted with the Zionist regime that has terrorised the larger Muslim neighbourhood with its US-funded arsenal and deadly firepower . It is widely known that Hindutva has been inspired by the Nazis and Mussolini 's Fascists . The extermination of Jews at the hands of Hitler has long been idealised by the Sangh as the ' final solution ' to deal with India 's own minorities . This has n't in any way dampened the love affair between Hindutva and Zionism . Indeed , the Hindutva ideologues have long admired Israel , hoping to replicate its apartheid model of the supremacy of one religion and culture . As Anilesh S Mahajan has argued , Israel is everything that the RSS has wanted India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> This is why this government has been in bed with Israel -- the last symbol and vestige of colonial tyranny and apartheid -- ignoring the close relations that India has historically enjoyed with the Arab world . The region is home to around 10 million Indian workers who contribute more than $35 billion annually in foreign remittances to the economy . In addition , it 's not Israel but the UAE and Saudi Arabia ( second and third , respectively ) that are India 's largest trading partners after the US . Yet successive governments have increasingly hobnobbed with Israel , ignoring its abominable crimes against humanity and long history of persecuting the Palestinians . <p> There are many parallels between Hindutva and Zionism . If the Israelis have found and invented new ways of humiliating and dehumanising Palestinians in what little remains of their own land over the past seven decades and more , Hindutva has been looking to reclaim the imagined ' Akhand Bharat ' by cleansing it of the people it has always considered to be ' impure ' and ' invaders ' . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the ubiquitous check posts under some pretext or the other , the Hindutva zealots have been going on a rampage since Modi came to power , lynching Muslims in the name of the cow and other such excuses . There is an unholy nexus between two ideologies of hate . Joining forces with the US neo-cons , it is a powerful axis , which is united in its visceral hatred of Islam and has long plotted against its followers . Now with power in its hands , it is totally out of control . Look at the chaos and turmoil that it has unleashed in India . <p> This is an alarming state of affairs , to say the least . It 's even more so considering those at the receiving end seem so disorganised and oblivious to the spectre . The Muslim world , preoccupied with its own internecine conflicts and domestic economic issues , is indifferent to the clear and present danger . The opposition in India is in total disarray and appears incapable of taking on the growing menace of Hindutva . <p> But doing nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our own small ways and continue to work for a global alliance of peace and justice against the forces of darkness .

He asked if the matter fell under the court jurisdiction or the Election Commission of Pakistan ( ECP ) . <p> Naeem Bokhari said that Nawaz Sharif lied over selling Gulf Steel Mills for 33 million dirham while Azizia Mill was not sold for 63 million riyal , adding that PM was getting gifts from Hill Metal and Hussain Nawaz .

@@19659238 <h> The decline of Daesh in Pakistan <p> KARACHI : The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL ) seems to be fast losing its charm for militants from Pakistan . After its emergence in Khorasan two years ago , the group made some quick inroads into the Pakistani militant space . But recent events suggest , and security analysts concur , that the trend has clearly reversed in the last few months . <p> ISIL announced its Khorasan Province in January 2015 , appointing former Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ) commander from Orakzai Agency Hafiz Saeed Khan as its provincial Wali and former Afghan Taliban commander Abdul Rauf Aliza as his deputy . They were soon joined by Shahidullah Shahid , a former TTP spokesman , and four other commanders of Kurram and Khyber tribal regions and Peshawar and Hangu districts . <p> Both Hafiz Saeed Khan and his deputy were killed in US drone strikes in July 2016 and February 2015 , respectively . But the outfit continued to engage in terrorism in Pakistan , claiming attacks believed to be carried out with logistical support from Sunni sectarian outfit , the Lashkar-e-Jhganvi . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abdul Ghafoor Haideri , deputy chairman of the upper house of Pakistan 's Parliament and leader of the religo-political party Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam ( Fazl ) . <p> JUI-F has traditionally been seen as close to Sunni militant groups in Pakistan . The attack on the JUI-F leader , thus , created differences between Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and Daesh . Most of the 25 killed in the attack claimed by the IS were workers of the JUI-F and students of its associated religious seminaries.Jamaatul Ahrar ( JuA ) tops the list of those outfits in the Pakistani militant space seen as close to the IS . But on July 17 , 2017 , Asad Mansoor , JuA spokesman , issued a statement titled " We do not belong to Daesh . " He held that Khalid Khorasani , JuA chief , had long ago made it clear that the group was not associated with Daesh . The statement had come in response to a statement made by the Army spokesperson , declaring the JuA to be an affiliate of the IS . <p> Some security experts have seen this ' clarification ' by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which had attracted many local militant outfits initially . When Pakistani Taliban militants like Hafiz Saeed Khan joined the Daesh 's Khorasan chapter , many local militants had been lured by the monetary benefit expected to come from association with the organisation founded in the Arab region . " Their expectations turned out to be false as the organisation did n't have as much funding , " says Sami Yousufzai , a journalist and security expert , who has exclusively reported on the militant organisation operating in the region . <p> Other security experts believe that the hegemony of Afghan Taliban in Afghanistan has also made an association with Daesh difficult . In the aftermath of military operations in Pakistan , the militants of the TTP and other local groups were compelled to take refuge in Afghanistan . " In order to enjoy the support of their Afghan counterparts , the Pakistani Taliban need to keep a distance from the Islamic State , which is a competitor of Al Qaeda , an active ally of the Afghan Taliban besides the claimant of Khalifatul Muslimeen . " Former Taliban Chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Amir , wrote a letter to ISIL Chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi asking him to stop operation inside Afghanistan . <p> The Islamic State 's downfall in Iraq is also seen as one of the reasons for its declining popularity . The Islamic State 's terrorists have suffered huge losses in Iraq and those having escaped death have moved towards Al-Nusra Front or Jabhat al-Nusra , an Al Qaeda associated outfit , experts opine . <p> " In 2014 , IS benefited from the defection of TTP and Al-Qaeda cadres abandoned by their commanders on the run from drone strikes . Since then , IS as a brand has struggled to take off in the tribal belt . Hafiz Saeed paled in stature and influence to most Mehsud Taliban leaders and struggled to consolidate . In recent months the routing of ISIS in Iraq has hurt the brand even more , " says Chicago-based scholar Asfandyar Mir , an expert on counterinsurgency and armed groups in South Asia . <p> Disassociation : A Strategy for Survival Agreeing that Daesh is declining in Khorasan , analysts also think that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " JuA wants to maximise its survival chances in Afghanistan so its disavowal of Daesh makes sense . US forces are much more likely to target Omar Khalid and his men in Afghanistan if they are seen as a part of Daesh , " Mir added . <p> Mir adds that JuA Chief Omar Khalid Khorasani or Abdul Wali is an experienced militant commander who has cushioned blows against his group using similar tactics in the past . In 2010 , at the peak of the Frontier Corps-led military operation against the Mohmand faction of the TTP , Omar Khalid deceptively offered to surrender to the Army , which bought him valuable time and allowed him to flee . <p> " Whenever they have found themselves crippled in front of the Pakistan Army , they begin to issue such statements . They also issued a revised manifesto a few months back and promised no attacks on civilian targets . Then , Sehwan Sharif happened , " says Khalid Mohammad , Islamabad-based security expert and the director general of Command Eleven think tank . <p> Muhammad claims that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training is also from Iraq . And while they claim no affiliation , they happily share the name . He adds that the JuA 's claim that they are not operating in ISKP-controlled areas is also false . " TTP has been hosted by NDS since 2007 , when they were splintered , their groups found safe haven in Paktia , Nanghar , Khost and Kunduz provinces along the Pak-Afghan border . " <p> " Since ISKP is a combination of failed and disgruntled fighters from the Taliban , TTP , and Al-Qaeda , their membership base is thinning out due to successful operations by the Pakistan Army on our side of the border and by the Taliban on the Afghanistan side . " <p> However , not everyone agrees that JuA 's disavowal of Daesh is part of its survival strategy . " IS has been limited to two districts of Afghanistan .

If constitutional changes do take place , it will be a matter that turns back the pages to how the constitution has been meddled with by military dictators . The lines in the debate over Articles 62 and 63 , controversial since they were inserted into the constitution under the dictatorship of the late General Ziaul Haq , are now very clearly drawn . Suggestions are being made that the said articles be pulled out , or clarified to explain precisely what they mean , or amended . The PPP had taken this line in the past and , although it appears to be refusing to actively do so at the present moment , the Senate 's suggestion that parliamentary supremacy be strengthened indicates a willingness to move towards resolving issues that could threaten parliament . <p> Meanwhile , we have a ' resistance ' movement brewing .

It seems this will remain the case as long as it is the honesty of his political rivals that is under question . Imran has warned that a " conspiracy " against the articles will be fought .

' Honest ' games by the power hungry have been played before at the expense of this country . Parties and politicians are playing the game again according to what suits their interest . Even the pretension of rising above gross opportunism has vanished . We know that Articles 62 and 63 , at least in their current form , can really do nothing to prevent corruption . They never have -- and that was never their purpose . It is a telling indication of the failure of political parties that these articles have remained ' unused ' with us so long and finally came into play in a most unfortunate way with an elected prime minister disqualified .

There had been many territorial disputes among the countries in the near and distant past . Even today , many countries have been held hostage to countless territorial disputes . The Anglophone and Francophone rivalry had been an impinging factor in defining the contours of relations of many countries . Britain and Argentina have a longstanding dispute over the Falkland Islands , Britain and China continue to have rows over Hong Kong while Armenia and Azerbaijan are embroiled in a conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh . <p> Nevertheless , the most ironic undercurrent of the Kashmir dispute is its violent trajectory . In a world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matrix of global politics is undergoing an inexplicable phenomenon of human rights interventions , the Kashmir issue has tragically endured over time . <p> The Kashmir issue should once again be seen as an international issue and a humanitarian crisis .

Human rights violations must end in Kashmir and Kashmiris must be recognised as a party to resolving the dispute .

Deposed prime minister Nawaz Sharif has also given his nod to holding this dialogue . The purpose of this initiative is to correct the imbalances that have developed between various state organs over the decades . <p> There have been a large number of proposals and agreements to strengthen democracy in Pakistan . But most of these efforts has simply focused on institutional imbalances . As a result , a majority of people have remained indifferent to these proposals and agreements as they do not entail any concrete mechanisms that could address the day-to-day problems of the hapless masses . <p> For instance , out of 36 clauses of the Charter of Democracy , only the 19th point highlights the problems faced by the people of this country .

The answer is : any dialogue is doomed if it does not discuss the imbalances in society ; the rampant poverty that is forcing people to sell their blood , organs and even their children ; the merciless unemployment that is pushing the youth towards crimes and mafias ; the rampant corruption that is sapping the very foundation of Pakistani society ; the stark class differences that are turning people against politics and politicians ; and the tentacles of extremism and sectarianism that have been strengthening the non-democratic forces of the country . <p> So , this national dialogue should n't just focus on confining state institutions to their constitutional limits ; it should also come up with a mechanism to lift millions of people out of poverty over a period of time .

@@20164240 <h> Educating Pakistan 's next generation <h> Cultivating a society where a level-playing field is a distant dream is a breach of Jinnah 's vision for Pakistan <p> There is little to debate about the state of education in Pakistan . At every level , and in almost every way , Pakistan 's children have been failed by their elders , both within the state and across society . There is a robust debate about the value of education , but one of the widely accepted theories about the public sector delivery of education is that it offers among the clearest paths to establishing a level playing ground between society 's haves and have-nots . <p> On Pakistan 's 70th founding anniversary , we can choose to look back at the failures of public sector education , or we can establish a consensus on what is required to change the trajectory . I believe it is as important to look forward as it is to look back . In seventy short years , Pakistan has become one of the most populated and youngest countries on the planet . This poses a challenge of scale . Over the next three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will need to provide young Pakistanis with the opportunities and incomes that enable them to explore their potential and live with dignity . While the demographic dividend or youth bulge that Pakistan enjoys can be seen as an opportunity or a threat , it is primarily a responsibility . Pakistani decision-makers do not have the luxury of putting this issue on hold -- the matter of opportunity and dignity for young Pakistanis is a question facing over 100 million people below the age of 25 . Any debate about Pakistan 's future that does not place these young people at the centre of the conversation is an incomplete one . <p> Traditional solutions to the question of opportunity for young people can help move the needle a little bit , but they can not offer the transformational changes needed to adequately address the great responsibility on our shoulders . Low enrolment rates are already improving at the primary school level , but middle and secondary school enrolment still lags far behind . The classroom experience for any child not born to wealthy parents is nightmarishly bad -- and poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are proof of the nightmare . Vocational training , a red-hot trend for several years , represents an endorsement of unequal and separate tracks for the children of rich and poor , and should be reconsidered and reconfigured . <p> The future for the unskilled is bleak . Every forecast and projection suggests that many vocations currently offering gainful employment will be obsolete before 2030 . Children for whom the only option is in a low-skilled profession are being cheated of a bright future , because low-skilled professions will witness an en masse obsolescence . Self-driving cars will make taxi drivers a novelty , whilst robotic arms and basic algorithms will render tens of millions of factory workers redundant . <p> The idea of Pakistan was rooted in avoiding a future of unequal and skewed opportunities . Cultivating a society where a level-playing field is a distant dream is a violation of Jinnah 's Pakistan .

Smaller countries like Finland and Singapore have identified the importance of level playing fields through government schools , and successfully demonstrated a way forward . High quality teachers is a vital first step , and since 2013 , starting with the Punjab , every province has now adopted standardised testing as a litmus test for recruiting teachers . Today over 125,000 teachers in all four provinces ' public sector are fresh recruits hired through the NTS testing mechanism . This trend needs to become standard practise , and the testing rigour of NTS must continue to be challenged and improved . <p> A focus on regurgitating facts needs to be supplemented , and eventually replaced by a relentless effort to equip children with cognitive skills and creative problem solving .

That can only happen when every child goes to school , stays in school , and learns to apply her or his mind with confidence and dexterity . That ultimately is the surest path to the Pakistan of Jinnah 's dream . On Pakistan 's 70th birthday , that is a dream worth keeping alive . <p> This essay was first published by Jinnah Institute 's Independence Day special feature .

These failures have often been plastered-over by shifting the blame to the Pakistani government . Pakistan has been constantly told to ' do more ' in its bid to fight terror . This is rhetoric that became routine during the Bush and Obama administrations . <p> However , the political landscape has changed significantly since those administrations . The American policy of asking Pakistan to do more to earn its foreign aid may no longer be feasible . Pakistan has already made progress in uprooting domestic terrorists and has alternative foreign policy options . <p> Pakistan has waged significant military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gains have been made in eradicating domestic terror networks from Pakistan .

While acts of terrorism are still weekly news , they are no longer daily news . There has been renewed resolve to fight terrorism through a national consensus , political support and military might . <p> Such evidence suggests that the days of training camps and militancy safe-havens in Pakistan 's tribal regions may finally be coming to a close . For the Trump administration to not mention the gains Pakistan has made in eradicating terrorism in the prime-time address is a gross disservice to its ally . <p> Pakistan is also no longer isolated in its foreign policy . Pressure on Pakistan to accept US Aid may not be as applicable as it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underway to seal the Pak-Afghan border which could significantly stop the inflow of proxy terror groups from neighboring territory . <p> Pakistan also has a pivotal regional ally in China .

United States pressure on Pakistan also comes at a time when hopes of a Russian-US reconciliation have evaporated and Pakistan is already looking north to a potential ally in Putin . <p> The Trump Administration has also taken two other problematic , yet important , policy initiatives . It has called for more troops in Afghanistan and has invited India as a stakeholder in the Afghanistan peace process . <p> The call for more troops will please Pentagon . It is a signature move for a Republican president at a time of crisis .

It is only through a comprehensive political dialogue that peace can be restored to Afghanistan . <p> It is also of note that the Trump administration has finally and formally accepted Indian ambitions to become a stakeholder in the Afghanistan peace process . This may be the most problematic policy declaration from the Trump speech for Pakistan . <p> Indian involvement in Afghanistan will destabilise the security balance in the region . It will further rejuvenate the use of Afghan territory to lodge proxy war in the Af-Pak region . Pakistan has already made formal complaints against Indian agencies using Afghanistan to plan attacks in Pakistan .

He would not shut the door on negotiations till the last minute <p> Balochistan will mark Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti 's 11th death anniversary on August 26th . Political parties as well as Baloch people observe the day as a black day in the province 's history . <p> The way Nawab Akbar Bugti embraced martyrdom in Tatani mountain range of the province has since turned him into a legend like those Baloch warriors described in Persian poet Firdausi 's works . <p> Firdausi ( 934-1020 ) has described Baloch tribal warriors in the following words , " when provoked and challenged they did not look back to match their mettle against mighty powers . It is observed from the abundant war records of history through the ages " . <p> Born on July 12 , 1927 , Bugti attended the Aitchen College in Lahore and then proceeded to Oxford University in United Kingdom before stepping into politics . <p> Bugti was n't just a local hero but also a national politician whose cause resonated throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from other politicians of his generation . He was a well-read man with a gifted intellect . Being an astute politician , he looked at issues with a political lens and always sought to find solutions through political means . <p> Nawab Bugti was a staunch democrat who had strong faith in left-wing politics . He would not shut the door on negotiations till the last minute . Having remained politically active for five decades , Bugti 's figure looms large on the politics of Balochistan . He also has tremendous contributions towards Baloch nationalism . <p> Bugti 's first stint in the government started in May 1958 when he took up the office of the interior ministry in Malik Feroz Khan Noon 's cabinet . Soon the cabinet was dismissed as General Ayub Khan took on the reins of the martial law administration . <p> In 1960 , Bugti joined the National Awami Party ( NAP ) but developed differences with the leadership overtime . He was firmly in Zulfikar Ali Bhutto 's camp by the time the latter dismissed the NAP government in Balochistan . Bugti was appointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rein in the NAP . Meanwhile , Bugti faced criticism from within the nationalists ' ranks of his silence over military deployment in against NAP 's leadership . In 1974 , Bugti resigned from governor 's office following disagreements with Bhutto administration in the centre . <p> After a long gap in his political career , he joined Balochistan National Alliance ( BNA ) and in February 1989 he was elected chief minister of the province . <p> Baloch nationalist politics could n't realise its promise partly because of the role played by some certain quarters and partly because of internal quibbling and differences among nationalists . <p> However , Bugti still attempted to get all Baloch nationalist parties under the same umbrella when in 2004 he called for a united front of these parties . But there were a lot of barriers that prevented the possibility . <p> In 2005 , Bugti presented a 15-point charter of demands that was ignored by the federal government . <p> On the question of Bugti 's life and legacy as that of a typical sardar or a nationalist , there can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights of the oppressed people and this earned him great accolade . To the critics who label him as a warlord , one may quote Bugti 's following statement , " we have been struggling for our rights and for this purpose we have suffered hunger , hardships , and imprisonment . " <p> On the question of Bugti 's life and legacy as that of a typical sardar or a nationalist , there can not be any doubt that he raised his voice for the rights of the oppressed people and this earned him great accolade <p> When the political situation turned tense in 2005 , Bugti gave an interview to BBC in June where he has been quoted to have said , " They the government are communicating with us through canons , fighter jets , deep penetration bombs , this is such a great dialogue . They are having a loud discussion with us . <p> By the time Bugti spoke with the Time correspondent via a satellite phone , he had burned all his boats and was based in Tatani mountain range . He is quoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bed , I 'd rather choose death come to me while I 'm fighting for a purpose ' . <p> Despite the federal government 's attempts to paint him as a typical warlord and autocratic feudal despot , the manner of his death ensured his destiny as a martyr for Baloch nationalism 's cause . <p> And in retrospect , it will be clear to any observer of Baloch nationalist politics that the situation prevailing in the province during his lifetime was a lot more normal than how it has turned out after his death . His assassination was condemned both at national and international levels . <p> Parallels were drawn between his killing and the way we dealt with the unrest in East Pakistan where another military dictator General Yahya Khan preferred guns over dialogue . <p> But the most unfortunate aspect of Bugti 's sacrifice was that it could n't culminate in unity of all Baloch nationalist groups . <p> The writer is a freelance columnist and blogger who writes on socio-political and literary issues 
@@20184231 <h> Jehan Ara <h> In view of Independence Day on August 14 , all of August , the Daily Times will highlight individuals who continue to make Pakistan proud . Our 25th interview is with activist , multimedia professional and the president of P@SHA -- Jehan Ara <p> You are a motivator , an entrepreneur , a social activist , a writer and a regular speaker at seminars and conferences , colleges and universities . Where do you think your strength lies and what do you want to be remembered as ? <p> I think my strength lies in my passion for everything I do . It 's that passion that drives me to strive for excellence . For example I motivate not for the sake of mere motivation but because I see so much potential in so many of our young people -- potential that is not realised simply because people do n't believe in them . I write only about things that matter to me -- that either make me happy or that celebrate things and people around me . I also write about things that concern me , that I feel require changing . I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the effort to bring about change . <p> Is being an IT technician something you always aspired to do when younger ? <p> Actually , I am not a technical professional at all . I started off my life as a writer , went into PR , marketing , advertising and communications and before multimedia became a buzzword , I became part of a team that developed pioneering multimedia products . That was my entry into the technology sector . It happened in the early ' 90s . What a lot of people do n't seem to understand is that the tech sector comprises of many elements and talent streams -- there are the innovators , the computer scientists , the entrepreneurs , the user experience professionals , the product managers , the business guys , the creative people and so many others . Each one of them is equally important and has a role to play . <p> How did The Nest I/O and P@SHA happen for you ? <p> When I moved back to Pakistan and co-founded a multimedia company with my mentor and friend Zaheer Kidvai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an association that represented the sector that I had inadvertently become a part of . P@SHA existed and was run by a strong group of individuals . I joined the association , became an active part of it and was eventually asked to join the executive board . I strongly believe that trade associations can only be effective if people come together and lend their voice and their strength to the body that is trying to bring about policy change . A common platform is always a stronger means of communicating with the government . That is beneficial for everyone in the industry . The Nest I/O came out of a need that was identified by young people in the community -- a need for mentorship , for a space where like-minded people from the community could converge , share their talents , their ideas , their knowledge , discuss challenges and learn from each other . P@SHA had been running multiple events for young aspiring entrepreneurs as part of our overall strategy to grow the sector and to provide the support that was needed by companies large and small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events , our Start-up Insider Series and our Social Innovation Fund were only some of the key things we were doing . As a next step to fulfilling the need of aspiring tech innovators , we decided to take the plunge and set up The Nest I/O . It was an experiment that has succeeded beyond anything we ever expected . It has now been around for over two and a half years . We have just incubated our sixth cohort of entrepreneurs and each day is more interesting and fulfilling than the next . <p> Tell us about an interesting and memorable moment that happened during your career . <p> There have been so many . I do n't think it is possible to pick just one . I have been so fortunate in the work I have been allowed to do , in the things I have been able to learn , in the amazing people I have met , collaborated with and come to admire . But I think one of the memories that stand out is my experience at Headway Media Services -- a media company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell anyone anything . I worked for him and with him for nine years . After the first few years , Adrian came to me and said that he wanted to make me a director in the company and give me a 40 percent stake . I told him I did n't want it , that I was happy with the work and the remuneration . It was a very small company -- a handful of people accomplishing the most amazing things . That is why I find it so amazing when young people change jobs saying they need to work for a larger company because they can only grow if they can report to someone , if they have multiples of people reporting to them . My God , do n't they understand that the growth and learning and competence and skill happens much more in a start up and/or in small companies where you are not restricted to one kind of work . Anyway , to get back to the story , Adrian would n't take no for an answer and insisted that I become a partner in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full signing authority on all our bank accounts -- US$ , Pound Sterling , Deutsch Marks , Hong Kong Dollars , etc . Again I resisted . I told him he should n't do this . He travelled so much . What if I ran away with all the money ? He should not place so much trust in one individual . In answer to this he looked straight at me and said " But you would n't do that , would you ? " Of course I would n't but he could n't have known that . Such trust , such faith . I was totally blown away by it and made sure there was never a second when he regretted having this level of belief and trust in a young woman from Pakistan . <p> ' I too owe a lot to this country and although I have had opportunities to move out , I have chosen to stay and give back to this country and its people . It is the least all of us can do ' <p> You have 29 years ' experience in marketing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Far East , the UAE and Pakistan . How much do you think our country is lagging behind in the field of information technology ? In what ways can we improve and move forward ? <p> Our country has amazing potential ; a lot of talent , a young population that has the power to reach for the stars and often does despite all the challenges we face . Many companies in the IT sector have done a lot of great work , provided employment to large numbers of graduates and improved the lives of so many people . However , this sector needs to be recognised and given the status it deserves . We have not accomplished even a percentage of what we can . What we need is lots more investment in relevant training , seed capital for experimentation and innovation , growth capital for scaling companies and tax incentives that will allow companies to reinvest in its human capital , infrastructure , marketing and growth . <p> What are you currently working on ? <p> I am currently working on preparing for P@SHA 's Annual ICT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awards recognise innovation in the ICT sector in Pakistan and showcase it to the world . I am also working with my team on new initiatives at The Nest i/o to add to the already existing energy in the space . In addition , I am looking at raising a start-up fund so that The Nest i/o can help start-ups with good potential face the initial financial challenges that they face in terms of seed and follow-on funding . <p> What is your vision for Pakistan and what does it mean to be Pakistani for you ? <p> It is really not up to me alone to have a vision for Pakistan . I think there are so many bright and talented people in this country who know what needs to be done to recognise the true potential of Pakistan . There is no reason that we should not be up there being counted amongst the comity of nations . We need to stop thinking of " me " and " I " and more about " us " . To me Pakistan is a country with a population that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't allow ourselves to . To me this country means everything . My father used to say that if not for Pakistan , he would never have been able to give us the education , the up bringing and the kind of life that we enjoy now . This country allowed him to build his career , to make a life for his family and to contribute to the community . He said he owed Pakistan everything . I too owe a lot to this country and although I have had opportunities to move out , I have chosen to stay and give back to this country and its people . It is the least all of us can do . <p> Policy advocacy through the use of cutting-edge technology is one of your passions . What more do you feel the most passionate about ? <p> I am often asked why I focus on technology being used to empower people when poverty , hunger , lack of water and power are such essential problems in the country . My answer to this is that I understand we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us who are addressing different problems . I focus on technology because I have seen how it can change the lives of young people . A kid from a small town can build a company with his/her talent and a very small amount of money , launch it and turn it into a successful business . If he understands the customer segment that the product or service is aimed at , and is actually solving a problem , there is no reason that he does n't have a chance of making it big . Even those who do n't want to start businesses , often bid for online work and generate thousands of dollars for themselves and their families . With the cost of mobile phones decreasing on a regular basis , the ability to own and use a phone to start a business is getting much easier . If you look at the Grameen Bank model in Bangladesh , it was the women in rural areas that benefited the most . It is important however that the government ensures that the policies that are brought into play do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this technology for the benefit of young people in this country . It is extremely important not to have excess regulation that will restrict innovation . We have already started seeing technology being used in healthcare , agriculture , governance , and education and for the empowerment of disadvantaged groups . We need to allow this to grow by leaps and bounds . <p> Describe a typical day in the life of Jehan Ara . <p> No day in my life is typical . Each day is an adventure . I work with people who are innovative and who wake up each day with new ideas , new energy , and new passion . It is no wonder then that I look forward to each day . I do n't consider what I do as a job . It is my passion . It is what makes me happy and that is why you will find me at work from 8:30am to 9:30pm six days a week .

I was asked to speak on " Investment in South Asia " so I talked about entrepreneurship in Pakistan , the growing wave of young people starting innovative businesses , impacting the society and creating wealth for themselves and their families . I told them that investors should start looking at the potential of a country with 200 million people a lot of whom were talented young people . " If you do not invest now , " I said , " It will be a missed opportunity . " I found that as I spoke , people actually listened and were surprised at the stories I related .

The CSA will have a representation of five players - most from any country - in the World XI team that is set to tour Pakistan next month . Lorgat explained that the players themselves felt it was right to support cricket in Pakistan . The players " made themselves available for World XI as they believe it is the right thing to do to support Pakistan and we encouraged them " , Lorgat told a group of journalists here in a briefing ahead of the T20 Global League players ' draft .

@@20215234 <h> India look to wrap-up the series against ailing Sri Lanka <p> PALLEKELE : India will fancy their chances of wrapping up the five-match series when they lock horns with a beleaguered Sri Lanka in the third One-day International on Sunday . The visitors have a 2-0 lead in the series and can wrap up the contest with another win here before leaving for the last leg of the tour in Colombo . India recovered from a precarious 131 for seven to record only their second win at the Pallekele International Cricket ground . The Men in Blue have n't played much ODI cricket here , and Thursday 's match was only their second at this venue , having played previously in 2012 . It does reflect on their hundred percent record here then , and the short two-day gap between the second and third ODIs will help them take the winning momentum forward . The big question is if skipper Virat Kohli will continue with his bold approach when it comes to team strategy , if not team selection . <p> Ahead of the second ODI , he had outlined the need to give ample opportunity to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such , it is only to be expected that Axar Patel and Yuzvendra Chahal will continue to be front-line spinners then . However , the complication in the 231-run chase in the second ODI occurred due to a shuffle in the batting order . After a great start , Kohli sent in KL Rahul and Kedar Jadhav ahead at number 3 and 4 respectively . The mini-experiment failed spectacularly , mostly because they could n't read Akila Dananjay 's googlies properly . Jadhav 's impulsive shot making during a three-ball stay also did n't go unnoticed . Again then , it is a wonder if Kohli will experiment again on Sunday . The Indian skipper might just revert to the original batting order and close out the series before ringing any changes in the last two ODIs in Colombo . In doing so though , he will be departing from his claims of ' making unpredictable changes despite facing defeat ' . <p> All said and done , India 's collapse on Thursday has brought this additional ( but welcome ) interesting twist to the equation here . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toss on this tour , and predictably chose to chase again . With Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan putting on a century stand , in a way , it was the catalyst for the shuffle in batting-order , as the Indian skipper probably did n't want a second game without action in the middle for Rahul and others . Could this force Kohli to rethink his bat-first theory , if he manages to win the toss yet again ? <p> As concerns changes to the playing combination , Hardik Pandya is in focus . In the lead-up to the second ODI , the all-rounder wore a light strap on his left knee , though the team management assured his full fitness . Later in the game , he pulled up with issues on the same left leg . While it appeared to be a calf problem for him , due to which he left the field on three occasions , again the team management outlined it as a cramp issue and not a major worry .

If not , then Kuldeep Yadav or Shardul Thakur could come into the reckoning as the fifth bowler , unluckily again for Manish Pandey as India will need someone to bowl Pandya 's 10 overs . While India could yet field an unchanged combination , there are bound to be further changes for the Sri Lankan playing XI . Upul Tharanga has been handed a two-match suspension for slow over-rate for the second time since the Champions Trophy in June , and he will sit out the next two ODIs . It could be a blessing in disguise as the skipper was suffering from a poor run of form , and the attacking Dinesh Chandimal , included in the Lankan squad , is expected to slot into Tharanga 's no.4 spot .

@@20261240 <h> Coke &amp; PBOTB : Battling for the soul of Pakistani music <p> Coke Studio ( CS ) is in trouble . And the freshly baked Pepsi Battle of the Bands ( PBOTB ) has completely failed to garner the ratings it was hoping for . Thing is , this has little to do with the quality of music and acts being showcased on both the shows . <p> CS - launched in 2008 with former Vital Signs man and producer Rohail Hyatt at the helm - enjoyed instant admiration from viewers . As the show 's scope continued to grow , so did its audiences . By the show 's fifth season , CS had become an institution of sorts ; the new face of Pakistan 's pop/rock mainstream . <p> The old mainstream had all but eroded in the early 2000s . It had matured in the mid-1990s before gradually disintegrating . Pop has always had a limited market in Pakistan . The success of this genre in the 1990s - facilitated by multinational sponsorships , media coverage and a growing number of concerts - had encouraged the mushrooming of new local pop and rock acts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had become too congested . <p> Due to the limited size of the local pop market , pop acts began to cannibalize each other . Other factors too set in to further the rot . The country 's economy began to buckle after the US imposed severe economic sanctions due to Pakistan testing a nuclear device . The law &amp; order situation too was constantly deteriorating . <p> The multinationals began to withdraw from the scene and the many recording studios and record labels that had sprung up closed shop . In the early 2000s , a spike in terrorist attacks in the country limited the number of concerts taking place . <p> For example , according to a former owner of a Karachi-based ' events managment company ' , there were almost 30 concerts in 1995 alone . By 2005 just two took place . In 2006 , none . <p> A band performs at a pop festival in Karachi in 1995 <p> When CS was launched on TV in 2008 , the aforementioned mainstream local pop scene was well and truly a thing of the past . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory of what the scene was like in the 1990s . But the songs were available online - even though ( and as everywhere else in the world ) CD and cassette sales had plummeted . <p> CS began as a way to introduce this generation to the country 's rich folk and pop music heritage . What could not be enjoyed at concerts and festivals anymore , was recreated in a widespread high-tech studio . A studio band made up of both pop/rock and folk instrumentalists was formed which facilitated established folk and pop artistes to recreate old hits for a new generation . The idea struck a nerve . And gold . <p> But Hyaat was only human . Driven by the show 's massive success and also by his continuing interest in the idea of merging music and ' spirituality , ' he surprisingly went out with a whimper when the ' experimental ' Season 6 of the show saw it almost completely departing from the winning formula established in the first five seasons . <p> To Hyatt Season 6 was about ' world music ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had become bloated and self-indulgent . This is when Hyatt made his exit . <p> A performance from Coke Studio 's Season 1 ( 2008 ) <p> Rohail <p> Coke brought in another 1990s act , The Strings , to produce the show . And right away the duo ( Bilal Maqsood and Faisal Kapadia ) put the spectacle back on its axis . Hyatt had begun to experiment just too early . Because CS as a show and platform was already an experiment . But one which had worked . <p> There was still so much out there in the country 's folk , ' filmi ' and pop vault to bring back and recreate for a generation looking to escape the brutal existentialist realities of the post-9/11 Pakistan . <p> Understandably , the Strings began cautiously . Once CS managed to recoup from the disasters of Season 6 , Maqsood and Kapadia expanded their range on Season 8 , bringing in a record 27 artistes and a new studio ensemble . But by Season 9 , CS had clearly begun to lose steam . Alarm bells should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had become too adventurous , Strings became too static . A vocalist who wanted to cover a semi-classical ghazal was initially dissuaded and told that the show 's formula only allowed updated renditions of pop and Sufi folk classics . On part of CS , this attitude reflected a rather myopic understanding of the kind of music the new generation was now exposed to online . <p> I remember , in the late 1990s , during a show on PTV , former Vital Signs vocalist Junaid Jamshed wanted to cover Mehdi Hassan 's song ' Jab Koi Pyar Sey Bolaye Ga ' ( which he recorded for 1969 's Urdu film Zindagi Kitni Haseen Hai ) . It 's a wonderful little tune , rich in melody . <p> The show 's producer asked JJ why would he want to do ' an obscure filmi song ' when he can either do a VS song or a pop version of a Sufi kaafi ? ' This is what folks want to listen to , ' he told JJ . But JJ stuck to his guns and performed the song . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and viewers kept asking it to be played on repeat -- including the original . <p> Strings <p> The most recent season of CS ( Season 10 ) is perhaps its worst in terms of ratings . It is true that some performances have not been very satisfying , but that 's the problem of doing covers . There will always be songs so well ingrained in the peoples ' minds that even a slight deviation would draw angry reactions . <p> So it 's not really the songs which have triggered the rot . It is the structure of the show which has begun to exhibit signs of rusting . This , and the fact that the Strings just refused to even slightly diverge from their overtly defensive formula which they came in with to salvage CS from the effects of Season 6 . The approach eventually made CS from being the much-awaited spectacle that it used to be to becoming an annual routine . It has gotten stuck in a rut . <p> This is going to be Strings ' last CS . Contrary to popular belief their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Strings were contracted to produce Seasons 7 till 10 right from the onset till Hyatt could refresh himself and rebound to pick things up again from Season 11 onward . <p> Considering the fact that Hyatt is far more open to new ideas , it would be best for CS to begin introducing some new aesthetic and structural innovations . It should become more socially conceptual in nature if the now worn-out structural concept is to be refurbished . But it will have to keep playing in the domain and context of Pakistan 's musical heritage to remain relevant . <p> On the other end , PBOTB is already in trouble . Again , the music is not the problem , as such . In fact I was surprised to note the talent displayed on the show . Where on earth are they emerging from ? There has hardly been a pop or music scene in this country for ages . <p> The way some of the acts exhibited such musical dexterity was indeed impressive . I have no qualms in suggesting that , being a person who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never came across the kind of talent displayed on PBOTB . Bands such as Badnaam , Dervesh , Roots , Madrock , Kashmir and the Pindi Boys are immensely gifted . <p> So what is ailing PBOTB then ? The structure . The concept . To begin with unlike CS , this one is an old concept . Not only did Pepsi try this back in the early 2000s , but the whole American Idol formula that PBOTB is based on , is quickly going out of vogue the world over . And Pakistan is no exception . <p> So despite the fact that PBOTB introduced some stunning new talent , one still gets that seen-it-done-that feeling . Pepsi has had a deeper connection and history with Pakistani pop music than Coke ever did . The hefty sums of money and experience that was put in to revive an old concept , should have been used in leveraging Pepsi 's historical connection with modern Pakistani music . <p> Pepsi could have contextualized this connection into a concept and then put new , emerging artistes in this concept . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concept to it . It 's just there , showcasing young guns being judged by big guns . How exciting is that ? <p> Remember Shoaib Mansoor 's Geetar ' 93 ( funded by Pepsi ) ? It was a simple concept in which the Vital Signs songs were physically set in various folk and ethnic cultures of Pakistan . The Signs ' melodic pop music was given a local context and this struck a note with a generation exposed to both sides of the cultural divide . <p> Both CS and PBOTB have done well to create windows from which a generation which is growing up during perhaps the country 's most culturally barren and politically awkward period , can peer into something more refreshing and reassuring . <p> But the same generation is also looking for social relevance . Indeed CS and PBOTB have managed to plug at least one aspect of the current cultural vacuum . But the reason CS is losing steam and PBOTB has gotten off to such a lukewarm start is that both have not attempted to plug a more social vacuum in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more significant social relevance . A social context and a concept which could keep enriching the shows ' aesthetic settings .

This year , pilgrims from Iran are also attending in strength . This is despite no diplomatic relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia following the deadly stampede during the 2015 Hajj that killed about 2,500 pilgrims -- including about 500 Iranians -- provoking a diplomatic row causing the cessation of the diplomatic relations between the two and exclusion of Iranians from last year 's Hajj . However , this year , there are more than 86,000 Iranian pilgrims attending Hajj , per the reports from IINA . <p> In contrast , the pilgrims from the tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Following the termination of diplomatic ties between several Gulf States led by Saudi Arabia and Qatar in June this year , amid a stringent economic boycott , Hajj also became the casualty of the bitter dispute . Despite being in close proximity to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and sharing a land border , only dozens of Qatari citizens have been able to make it to the pilgrimage this year , according to Qatari sources . Even if the Saudi media 's claims that Saudi Arabia has allowed 1,340 Qataris to enter the country for Hajj are deemed credible , it is a massive reduction from last year 's 12,000 Qataris who performed Hajj . <p> The public falling-out between the two countries over Hajj has created a bitter controversy with each accusing the other of politicising the pilgrimage . In late July , Qatar accused Saudi Arabia of politicising Hajj after it claimed Saudi Arabia had imposed restrictions on its citizens who planned to travel the kingdom for Hajj . Qatar also filed a complaint with the UN special rapporteur on freedom of belief and religion over the restrictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws and agreements that guarantee the right to worship " . <p> Amid the growing rancour , in a surprise move in mid-August , Saudi Arabia announced it would open its border for Qatari pilgrims and that King Salman would provide flights and accommodation to them during Hajj . However , the move was seen as a political stunt laced with ill will as the ' goodwill gesture ' was announced soon after a surprise meeting between Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and a little-known member of Qatar 's royal family , Sheikh Abdullah Al Thani , who lives outside of Qatar and belongs to a rival branch of the royal family that was ousted in a coup more than four decades ago . This provoked accusations that the Saudis were attempting to delegitimise the current emir of Qatar and seeking a regime change in Doha . While Qatar publicly welcomed the announcement to facilitate the pilgrimage , it warned Saudi Arabia to " stay away from exploiting hajj as a tool for political manipulation " . <p> The dispute has refused to die even as the pilgrimage is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuesday , Qatar denounced the Saudi media for " false " claims that Doha was preventing its citizens from the pilgrimage . Qatar 's Ministry of Endowment and Islamic Affairs accused the Saudi Hajj Ministry of " placing obstacles " against its citizens planning to perform Hajj . Earlier , it had also accused the Saudi Hajj authorities of " halting contacts " to safeguard the entry of Qatari pilgrims . The Saudi minister of Islamic Affairs , Saleh al-Sheikh , tried to dispel the partisan impression and reiterated that the kingdom serves all pilgrims without discrimination or exclusion on the basis of nationality , tribe or sect . However , the clash has created a negative public perception about the Saudis and added to the anxiety about the growing role of Saudi Arabia in internecine battles between Arabs and Muslim nations . <p> The Hajj spat has rekindled the old debate by some Saudi rivals about the international management of the holy sites in Makkah and Medina . While Qatar filed a complaint with the UN accusing Saudis of partisanship and playing politics , they also called for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backlash from the Saudis . Saudi Arabia 's Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said Qatar 's complaint amounted to a " declaration of war " , adding accusations that Qatar was trying to politicise the Hajj . After the stampede in 2015 that killed nearly 2,500 pilgrims , the worst tragedy in the history of Hajj , Iranians also renewed their Khomeini-era demands for placing the holy sites under international guardianship rather than under the Saudi management , a move more motivated to weaken the Saudi control rather than to better regulate the Hajj services . <p> On balance , the Saudi authorities have been providing extremely well-managed services for pilgrims , including very efficient management of massive crowds . Since the Al Saud family took over , almost a century ago , the management and the facilities have improved phenomenally and continue to do so as the Saudi authorities invest hundreds of millions annually in improving the assets and operational management of the holy sites . This year , for the first time , the Saudi Ministry of Education has established nurseries for children where pilgrims can leave their children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commendable service that certainly turns Hajj into a first large-scale child-friendly pilgrimage in the world . In addition , more than 15,000 officers are pressed into service for escorting pilgrims and maintaining their safety while they perform their rituals . Moreover , more than 3,000 " machines and devices " had been pressed into service to effectively respond to any emergencies . <p> The Saudi management of Hajj is on a par with international standards and any call for a different management would be chaotic and detrimental -- both operationally and politically -- and , therefore , must be avoided . However , the Saudi authorities would do well by avoiding using Hajj as a tool to reward or punish countries or groups of people that do not fit well with Riyadh 's world view .

@@20337232 <p> The duty of parents to teach their children the good , virtues . By Joseph Costa <p> Parents not teaching their children properly , or not at all , results in degeneration of society . We see this every day , everywhere . Of course , I am assuming here that parents actually know how , and what , to teach their children . In too many cases , parents themselves need teaching . Many do n't want to be taught , let alone learn . <p> Degeneration leads to disasters and war . And , as Jesus has said : ' war is hate . ' And hate is censured by God , as it 's a cognate of Hate , that is Satan . <p> In the Old Testament of the Bible , it is stated in the Book of Tobit , that Sarah married Tobias , who was well taught by his father and mother , Tobit and Anna , respectively . Tobit and Anna did a pretty good job , for their obedient holy son , Tobias , deserved being accompanied on a journey by angel saint Raphael , a name meaning " medicine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raphael is believed to be one of the seven great archangels who stand before the throne of God . <p> Jesus says that the Sacrament of marriage has long been symbolised in the Book of Tobit ( Vulgate Latin version ) , " ... in the holy marriage of Sarah , the daughter of Raguel , after she was freed from the demon . The Sacrament will give the married couple all the assistance needed to live together according to the Law Ten Commandments and the wishes of God . Husband and wife also become the ministers of a rite : the rite of procreation . Husband and wife become also the priests of a small church : their family . They must therefore be consecrated to procreate with the blessing of God and to bring up a progeny children that will bless the Most Holy Name of God . " <p> As too many marriages and de-facto couples are not consecrated by the Sacrament of marriage , it 's hardly surprising , then , that many children today are not conceived and born with " the blessing of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God . " <p> Many children , in today 's wicked times , which seem to be the long prophesied end times , are conceived through sheer lust and then aborted , mirroring to some extent , what the wicked ancient Canaanites used to do , adding the sin of homicide to the sin of carnal lust . The situation is even worse when , obeying the commandments of Satan , sinful single women willingly get laid and have children , who then go on to reflect the sinfulness of their wicked mothers , thereby degenerating society . <p> Jesus says : " The human body , washed by Baptism , is the temple of God 's Spirit . It should therefore not be violated with immodest behaviour or immodest dress . From a woman especially who does not respect herself , there can come only depraved offspring and a corrupt society - from which God withdraws Himself , and in which Satan ploughs and sows his briars , his troubles , that make you despair . " <p> Diabolical possession is widespread . <p> The Bible says that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a man , nor shall a man put on a woman 's garment , for whoever does these things is an abomination to the Lord your God . " ( Deuteronomy 22.5 ) <p> Have you ever seen women , in alluring tight pants , serve Holy Communion during the Sacrifice of the Mass , and the priest nearby saying nothing , being a covert accomplice by his silence ? <p> Jesus , true God and true Man , pursuant to the Gospel that He dictated to Maria Valtorta : <p> Jesus Christ teaches parenting , thus : <p> Jesus below explains the reasons why society today , worldwide , is degenerating . Natural disasters are warning signs of this degeneration , of God 's disapproval , warning man to change to the good . <p> " ... I would like to draw the attention of parents to how saint Joseph the putative father of Jesus on earth made a clever workman of Me , without any help of pedagogical educational system of learning . As soon as I was old enough to handle tools , he did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started Me to work and he made use of My love for His Mother , Virgin Mary as the means to spur Me to work . I was to make useful things for Mother . That is how he inculcated the respect which every son should have for his mother and the teaching for the future carpenter Jesus was based on that respectful and loving incentive . <p> " Where are now the families in which the little ones are taught to love work as a means of pleasing their parents ? Children , nowadays , are the tyrants of the house . They children grow hard , indifferent , ill-mannered towards their parents . They children consider their parents as their servants , their slaves . They children do not love their parents and they are scarcely loved by them by parents . The reason is that , while you parents allow your children to become objectionable overbearing fellows , you become detached from them with shameful indifference . <p> " They children are everybody 's children , except yours parents , O parents of the twentieth century as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are the children of the nurse , of the governess , of the college , if you are rich people . They children belong to their companions , they are the children of the streets , of the schools , if you parents are poor . But they are not yours . You , mothers , give birth to them and that is all . And you , fathers , do exactly the same . But a son is not only flesh . He has a mind , a heart , a soul . Believe Me , no one is more entitled and more obliged than a father and a mother to form that mind , that heart , that soul . <p> " A family is necessary . It exists and must exist . There is no theory or progress capable of destroying this truth without causing ruin . A shattered family can but yield men and women who in future will be more perverted , and will cause greater and greater ruin . And I tell you most solemnly that it would be better if there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth , rather than have families less united than the tribes of monkeys , families which are not schools of virtue , of work , of love , of religion , but a babel in which everyone lives on his own like disengaged gears , which end up by breaking . <p> Tower of Babel - very briefly : God dispersed all the people who were then before the Tower , by infusing various groups there with differing languages , thereby preventing them from communicating with one another , and thereby bringing about the end of the nonsense of the Tower , initiated by king Nimrod , due principally to pride . <p> " Broken families . You break up the most holy way of social living and you see and suffer the consequences . You may continue thus , if you so wish . But do not complain if this world is becoming a deeper and deeper Hell , a dwelling place of monsters who devour families and nations . You want it . Let it be so . " This destruction is already happening . <p> Jesus explains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treasure entrusted by the Lord to a servant to parents of His . But woe to that servant who does not bring children to yield fruit good deeds , virtues , leaves them idle , showing no interest in them , or , even worse , disintegrates and corrupts them . If God , in a tone of severity , is to require an explanation of those parents not attending to increasing the value of a talent a treasure - to increasing a child 's good deeds , virtues and inflict a lengthy punishment on those parents dissipating and killing damning to Hell the soul of a child , God , the master and judge of all that is , by an inexorable severe unforgiving verdict will inflict eternal punishment in Hell upon parents slaying damning to Hell the most valuable part of children - their soul . " <p> And , most severely , Jesus censures abortion , the murdering of babies , the silent genocide unparalleled in history , thus : " And now listen , you women , tacit unpunished murderesses of so many lives . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing in a womb , because of a guilty seed such as via rape or via a one night-stand or similar fling , or because it is an embryo which is not wanted , being a useless burden to your bodies and your wealth .

Do not join homicide to lust , violence to disobedience , and do not think that God does not see , simply because man does not see . God sees everything and remembers everything . You ought to remember that too . " Jesus , God , knows everything , seen and unseen , from eternity to eternity . <p> And Jesus says further : <p> " Be continent do not have sex if you are afraid you will not have clothing and food for those to be born . <p> " Do n't be inferior to the beasts , who understand the beauty of procreating and are able to impose a rein on themselves when an adverse season would deny nourishment to their young . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engage in irresponsible carnal unions , carnal lust , without giving due consideration to the children they beget . About this , Jesus says : <p> " How many souls to be infused into conceived children are there that your parents ' sensual appetite lust for carnal unions calls from Heaven and that you then close the gates of life to those children , by abortion , etc . ? How many children that barely reach their term and are born dying or already dead that you bar from Heaven ? How many are those upon whom you parents impose a weight of pain , which they children can not always bear , with a sick existence marked by painful and shameful diseases ? How many are those children that can not resist this kind of martyrdom , not wanted but affixed by you parents like a firebrand upon the flesh , which you have begotten without reflecting that , when one is corrupt like a tomb full of putrefaction , it is no longer licit to beget children to condemn them to pain and the loathing of society ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fate , commit suicide ? <p> " But what do you parents think ? That I will condemn them children for this crime of suicide of theirs against God and themselves ? No . Before them , who sin against two i.e. against God and against the child himself who suicided , are you parents , who sin against three : against God , against yourselves , and against the innocent children whom you parents beget to lead them children to desperation . Consider this . Consider it carefully . God is just , and if the sin of suicide holds weight , the causes of the sin also do . And in this case , the weight of the sin lightens the condemnation of the suicide , but aggravates the condemnation of you parents , true killers of your desperate children .

( PCP ) A Christian teenager who was highly academic despite years of institutional peer bullying and discrimination was killed by Muslim pupils whilst in a classroom environment in Vehari District in the Punjab . <p> Against all the odds Sharoon Masih gained the highest scores at his former school named Chack 461 EB , eponymous with its geographical location . So convinced were teachers that Sharoon would be a successful individual that they challenged the parents not to put him to work but to take him through higher education . His father Elyab Masih ( 35 yrs ) saved some money from the work he undertakes as a labourer on a brick kiln and paid for the admission for Sharoon to join ' MC Model Boys Government High School Burewala and District Vehari ' . <p> Sharoon was isolated from the very first day he joined the new school as he was the only Christian within his form . His parents told BPCA officer Mehwish Bhatti that he suffered years abuse from the very first day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was warned not to mix with other Muslims at school . One boy is believed to have said ' You 're a Christian do n't dare sit with us if you want to live ' . Many boys called Sharoon a ' chura ' which is a very derogatory term against Christians . Often attempts were made to convert him to Islam , however , Sharoon never lost his faith to the chagrin of the Muslim children around him exacerbating his pariah status . <p> Though it must have been very difficult attending a school in which you enter as anathema , Sharoon used his segregation to study and was noticeably one of the top performers in his classroom , even within a few days . His academic prowess however , only added to the disdain for him felt by other pupils . Even then Haroon Masih could never expect the brutality that led to his death on 27th August 2017 . Whilst in a classroom Sharoon was brutally beaten by nearly the whole class on only the fourth day at the school . <p> The violence was of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the classroom . Early pupil reports suggest that the teacher overseeing the classroom ignored the brutal mauling of a despised Christian . However the teacher has since claimed he was reading a newspaper and did not notice the attack . Later the Head Teacher stated that the attack occurred between classroom sessions and that one teacher was late on arrival allowing the incident to occur without notice . <p> All the reports state that as he was beaten a cacophony of insults were shouted at Sharoon in what must have been a nightmarish last moment of life for the Christian teenager . Questions are being asked about the inactivity of ' the classroom teacher ' ( if there ) and the duty of care of other teachers in the vicinity to react to the noise emitted form the melee . Already the school has taken action against the Head Teacher who has been dismissed form his post . <p> Reports about the trigger factor for the brutal murder vary , however a main culprit Muhammad Ahmed Rana has already confessed and has been arrested and detained by local police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killing of a Christian and no-one is willing to implicate the other murderers by naming them .

He has always been loved by teachers and pupils alike and shared great sorrow that he was being targeted by students at his new school because of his faith . <p> " Sharoon and I cried every night as he described the daily torture he was subjected to . He only told me about the abuse and violence he was facing . He did not want to upset his father because he had such a caring heart for others . <p> " The evil boys that hated my child are now refusing to reveal who else was involved in his murder .

He has said other boy 's were involved but so far has refused to implicate others . <p> Ambar Saroya , an officer for the BPCA met with the family and has been praying with them and counselling them . The family has expressed a desire to fight for justice for Sharoon and would like help with the cost of a solicitor . We estimate the cost for this due to the complexity of the case will be in the region of ? 2000 . If you would like to help us assist this family then please donate by clicking ( here ) . Sharoon was buried on 28th August 2017 and BPCA paid for the funeral . <p> The current First Incident Report ( FIR ) only names Muhammed Rana as the perpetrator for the murder yet both he and other puils have said other boys were involved . Moreover the head teacher and form teacher have both escaped any criminal conviction for negligence and manslaughter . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complaint to the Police that would then require them to write the particulars on an FIR that would initiate the process of a criminal prosecution . However , we would then have to continue the case to fruition or it will be dropped by the state , despite being a criminal investigation . <p> Wilson Chowdhry , Chairman of the BPCA , shared his thoughts on this latest murder of a vulnerable Christian , he said : " Christians are despised and detested in Pakistan they are a constant target for persecution . <p> " This killing of a young Christian teenager at school , serves only to remind us that hatred towards non-Muslims is bred into the majority population at a young age , through cultural norms and a biased national curriculum . <p> " This young family will have to cope with the immense emotional pain of a totally avoidable incident . It is a poor indictment of MC Model Boys Government High School that a Christian could be targeted in this fashion . However by no means is such treatment an anomaly - it is an expectation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the educational system . <p> " The Government of Pakistan failed to remove offensive texts within their national curriculum despite it having being highlighted by the United States Commission for International Freedom and potentially being a bar to future foreign aid . <p> " Such poor governance has inculcated generations of Pakistani citizens with false stereotypes that undermine the non-Muslims in their midst . This reciprocally has also made Muslims more susceptible to the hate ideology espoused by the many rogue Imams following hardline sects of Islam . <p> " Sharoon a bright and intelligent young boy who had a potentially good future has now been killed . Yet once again in Pakistan the debate is not on who is culpable but who is not culpable of a most heinous crime . " <p> BPCA is calling for a reform of the educational system in Pakistan , for the removal of the bias within the national curriculum which openly demonizes and caricatures minorities .

@@20519231 <p> The writer works for governance and rule of law with a national organisation <p> If the state has to deliver on the issue of minority rights , it must start paying more attention to their personal laws for marriage and post-marriage arrangements . Christians who constitute approximately 1.6 per cent of the population suffer because of discriminate and somewhat obsolete marriage and divorce laws . For far too long the state has ignored its citizens ' demand for dignified solemnising of marriages and various other post-marriage rights and responsibilities . The family laws of Christians are administered by four colonial-era acts such as the Christian Marriage Act of 1872 , Divorce Act of 1869 , Succession Act of 1925 and Births , Deaths and Marriages Registration Act of 1886 . <p> Throughout history , however , the issue of solemnising marriages has been the exclusive domain of religious leaders and clergymen . However , the modern state is believed to have intensified its role in regulating marital relations mainly based on issues concerning succession of monarchs that later expanded it to matters of succession of legal heirs of all citizens . With this historical development , the dominant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of marriages . <p> Successive governments in Pakistan amended laws enacted by colonial predecessors to meet the current governance needs of its citizens . These amended laws also included the marriage laws regulating marital relations . In this background , Muslim Personal Laws were widely reviewed in 1961 and changes were brought to The Muslim Family Law Ordinance , 1961 and The West Pakistan Family Courts Act of 1964 , however only limited progress was made to update or provide for marriage laws relating to religious minorities . The Christian Personal Laws also met the same fate . In 1949 , the Indian Divorce Act of 1869 was enforced in Pakistan for Christians after omitting the word ' Indian ' by an amendment and the law stood as the Divorce Act of 1869 ( Act IV of 1869 ) . <p> This law regulating the divorce of Christian couples was primarily based on the theological position and interpretation of the Church that divorce is not permissible in Christianity except on the ground of adultery or only in case either spouse changes his or her religion . Several amendments were made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amendment ) Act of 1975 ( 4 of 1976 ) , which got rid of several derogatory terms like " native " Christians . Similarly , the role of the high court as was the case before , was done away with . The jurisdiction to adjudicate issues relating to divorce and matrimonial issues was originally vested in district courts and the high courts . The Amendment Act omitted the former section 17 and conferred exclusive jurisdiction over the matters of this Act to the Civil Courts . The Divorce Act of 1869 also states the Code of Civil Procedure , 1908 to apply on proceedings mentioned in the Act . <p> In a similar amendment , the deletion of sections 16 , 17 , 17A and 20 from the act led to consequent amendments to sections 18 and 19 as well as section 57 to make a clear provision for either party to the marriage to marry again after a decree for dissolution or nullity of their marriage has been passed and time for appeal has expired or an appeal being presented has been dismissed . <p> However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pakistan the situation was further worsened during 1981 , when the then president , General Ziaul Haq , removed section 7 from the Divorce Act of 1869 through an ordinance called the federal laws ( Revision &amp; Declaration ) ordinance 1981 . This section provides Christian couples the right of divorce under the UK Matrimonial Causes Act of 1973 . Currently , under the act , Christian marriage can be dissolved absolutely by divorce ( Divortium Perfectum ) . It can also be dissolved by seeking decree of annulment of marriage that has consequence of marriage being void ab initio . The divorce law also provides for judicial separation which is not absolute divorce . Married couples are parted under it nonetheless the bond of marriage remains intact and the separated spouses can not remarry . <p> Nevertheless , the existing grounds for seeking divorce provides unequal grounds of divorce to a husband and wife . For that reason , a husband can pursue divorce by accusing his wife of adultery and then also prove it . The wife can also seek divorce through a petition on the grounds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has contracted another marriage under some other law . She can also supplicate for divorce on the grounds of adultery by her husband coupled with incest , or bigamy , or marriage with another woman , or of rape , sodomy or bestiality , or of cruelty , or of desertion . It is important to note that a wife can not petition for divorce on the ground of her husband 's adultery alone . She can not make a plea for divorce on the ground of cruel behaviour of her husband . <p> The other forms of dissolution , meaning nullity of marriage or divortium imperfectum , stipulate invalidating the marriage on grounds of impotency , prohibited decree relationship , lunacy and idiocy , existence of former marriage and vitiated consent . The decree of dissolution is in fact based on the declaration by a court that a marriage was void ab initio . Legally , the parties in wedlock are entitled to remarry when a marriage is annulled by a district judge . <p> Additionally , the spouses may look for judicial separation on the grounds of adultery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effect of the ecclesiastical divorce and can be reversed . The spouses are not allowed to remarry any other individual . <p> In order to get separation , the parties in wedlock usually level false accusations of adultery to assert divorce and that too is often succeeded to get decree ex-parte . In 2015 , a writ petition was filed by Amin Masih before the Lahore High Court wherein the he challenged the law of divorce for being " offensive and insulting " to women and requested the court to provide him and his wife a dignified way of separation without levelling adultery charges and change in religion . After due deliberation and seeking legal and citizens ' views , the LHC decided in the petitioner 's favour and restored section 7 of the Divorce Act of 1869 providing relief to Christian married couples to part ways , if they desire by invoking the UK Matrimonial Causes Act of 1973 . <p> Many other marriage and post-marriage arrangements still need to be considered by the state through amendments to existing laws . The Christian Marriage Act permits marriages where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not attained the age of 21 years ) with the consent of a father , mother or guardian . However , in case of marriage of a native Christian , the age at marriage was fixed to exceed 13 years for females and exceeding 16 years for males with the consent of a guardian . If the parties are getting married without the consent of a guardian , they must have attained 18 years of age . On the other hand , the Child Marriage Restraint Act of 1929 applicable in Punjab and The Child Marriage Restraint Act of 2013 applicable in Sindh set the minimum age of marriage for females and males at 16 and 18 years , respectively . <p> Another important issue is the absence of appropriate measures to register marriages of Christians . At the moment , due to the order of Supreme Court , the union councils are under duty of registering marriages , but there are still issues being observed in registrations . There should be some mechanism for registration on the part of a state department with clear rules . Likewise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and marriage records in relevant union councils by bringing a legislative amendment . <p> On the occasion of International Women Day on March 8 , 2017 , the Punjab government took the initiative to include amending Christian Personal Laws into women empowerment package for the year 2017 . In this background , the government mandated the Strategic Reforms Unit , the Punjab Human Rights and Minorities Affairs Department and the Women 's Development Department to consult stakeholders and make all-inclusive amendments to the centuries-old personal laws enacted by the British . However , there seems no significant development in this regard . A similar exercise is going on at the centre where the human rights ministry is holding a consultative process with community members , clergy and rights organisations to propose amendments to the said acts .

@@20534235 <h> Minorities rights enforcement <h> The move by the Chief Justice means that hundreds of cases pending in family courts regarding Christian divorce matters will now be adjudicated on just and reasonable grounds rather than on proving the charge of adultery <p> On 19 June 2017 , the honourable Chief Justice of Lahore Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah gave a landmark judgement regarding the interpretation of Christian divorce Act 1869 . The judgement was recently reported in a law journal called the Pakistan Law Digest August edition on page 610 . <p> The honourable chief justice delineated that the court is a constitutional court and it was not supposed to interpret the Bible or canonical law . Instead the court is supposed to enforce fundamental rights of Christian minorities by the interpretation of the constitution . <p> The court further elaborated that across the world in countries where Christians are living in majority , a Christian couple can seek divorce on reasonable grounds if they do not want to live together . Christian couples do not need to prove the charge of adultery in order to separate or seek divorce . <p> Unfortunately in Pakistan there was only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the divorce act . The act stated that a man had to prove a charge of adultery and then divorce his wife . <p> Therefore the court restored Section 7 of the Divorce Act of1869 which was removed by President Ziaul Haq through a federal declaration revision ordinance in 1981 . Through the restoration of section 7 all other grounds will be available to seek divorce which are available in courts of England and Wales under UK matrimonial causes act 1973 . <p> As a result , a Christian couple in Pakistan does not need to prove evidence of adultery to seek divorce . They can seek divorce on reasonable grounds or on mutual consent if they do not want to live together or they think the marriage ' irretrievably broken ' . The court also mentioned that there are no-fault divorce laws in countries where Christians are living in majority . The honourable chief justice further mentioned that in 2001 the Indian Parliament passed an amendment in the divorce act by giving cushion to Christians that they can separate on mutual consent rather than prove a charge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratified the international covenant on civil and political rights which states that minorities can freely exercise their religious and cultural rights . <p> The court elaborated by relying on convention on elimination of discrimination against women that imputing a charge of adultery on a woman is against her dignity and such imputation is deplorable and against fundamental rights . The Honourable Chief Justice has further relied on the comments of former High Court Chief Justice Mr Manzoor Qadir in his Judgement in 1963 in which he supported the possibility of availability of other reasonable grounds such as those available in England and Wales apart from accusing one 's wife of adultery which is a deplorable and disgusting act . <p> The court further relied on the Supreme Court 's Judgements which stated that right to practise religious beliefs depends upon an individual 's conscience ; so no one , belonging to any majority or minority denomination can impose his will or point of view upon others . <p> The court relied on the Supreme Court 's judgements which stated that the right to practise religious beliefs depends upon an individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority or minority denomination , can impose his will or point of view upon others <p> The judgement further delineated that the democratic norms of a country fully support the individual 's free will and conscience . <p> I had the privilege to appear as a leading counsel on behalf of petitioner Amin Masih to represent his case . I had to face a lot of opposition from parliamentarians who were not willing to amend the 1869 Divorce Act . <p> Amin Masih worked as a sweeper in a private hospital and he had no penny to bear the expenses of the case . I could have refused him but my conscience did not allow me as I realized and also appreciated that he did not want to impute falsely the charge of adultery on his wife .

The Honourable Chief Justice has given a landmark judgement and this is the first judgement of the Lahore High Court regarding the enforcement of fundamental rights of Christians in its 150-year history .

@@20553238 <h> Email <p> BY-ELECTION results should not be over-analysed . With low turnouts and given that these are typically low-stake contests , by-elections often produce outcomes that are a poor guide to what happens in a general election . So why worry about NA-120 ? Well because it is no ordinary by-election ! <p> It is not ordinary because it has come on the heels of Mr Sharif 's disqualification . It is a direct consequence of the constitutional case pursued single-mindedly by PTI that resulted in his disqualification . <p> It is our first opportunity to assess whether a significant proportion of the electorate in PML-N 's heartland is incensed at the disqualification and is willing to use the vote to register protest . Or are the sands shifting because voters view the ruling family as a mafia that must be held accountable ? <p> NA-120 has already proved to be susceptible to PTI inroads , even without Panama , which makes it an ideal constituency for observing which direction the wind is blowing in . PTI 's Dr Yasmin Rashid was able to erode PML-N 's substantial 2008 victory margin by 17 per cent in 2013 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost three times larger than the reduction in PML-N 's margin of 6pc in Lahore district overall . Hence , there is no reason to believe that PML-N is unlikely to face a fight if PTI 's message is resonating with voters . <p> The NA-120 by-election is by no means an ordinary poll . <p> How do we infer the direction of the wind from the result ? PML-N claims that voters are incensed at the establishment for usurping the power of their vote and dismissing their prime minister -- their guarantor of development . The two gauges of whether this claim holds will be high turnout and PML-N maintaining its 2013 victory margin of 26pc . An increase in this margin should really worry PTI as it will show the limits of a campaign built solely around Panama . <p> However , a fall in the PML-N victory margin below 10pc to 15pc and a lackadaisical turnout should worry the ruling party . This would indicate the possibility of a growing constituency for the accountability of the Sharif family . This would also give rise to fears that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the judgement as a sign of waning political authority . This is the infamous dismissal effect that has been empirically established for Punjab in the 1990s , where the ruling party dismissed through the Eighth Amendment was penalised in the subsequent election . At a minimum , such a result would embroil the party as it chooses its leader for 2018 . <p> The result will also reveal PTI 's ability to take the fight to areas where PML-N 's local organisation is entrenched , which has implications beyond the by-election . NA-120 contains two provincial assembly constituencies : PP-139 and PP-140 . In 2013 , Dr Rashid 's main gains were concentrated in PP-140 , where PML-N replaced their MPA who had won the 2002 and 2008 elections with a new candidate in 2013 . PP-139 , on the other hand , has an experienced and entrenched local organisation that goes back decades and it is here that she failed to make inroads . <p> Our analysis shows that in 2013 around 19pc of PP-140 's polling stations were closely contested , where PTI either won or lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure for PP-139 is 5pc . We also find a much larger reduction in PML-N 's victory margin ( 18pc ) in polling stations that were not closely contested in PP-140 compared to the fall ( 7pc ) in similar stations in PP-139 . To win 2018 PTI will have to demonstrate the ability to break into areas like PP-139 where PML-N is entrenched and the result will reveal their readiness to do so . <p> The result will also show whether PTI continues to resonate with women , an important group they were able to mobilise in the 2013 elections in NA-120 . The general impression is that women mobilised in support of PTI beyond NA-120 as well . An analysis of 2013 polling station level returns for NA-120 show that women did , indeed , give an edge to PTI especially in closely contested stations . We find that PML-N 's victory margin was on average 6pc less in a woman 's station compared to the male station in the same closely contested polling station neighborhood .

In Pakistan , both the public and private sector HR managers use English as a device to separate the wheat from the chaff in all higher civil service or private sector managerial positions . Even a Socratic intellect and knowledge would not help an Urdu-medium aspirant to get prestigious jobs in Pakistan . Conversely a mediocrity fluent in English would be quickly knighted . The global importance of English language can not be denied . But does this argument justify lowering the ceiling of life opportunities for the less privileged who have limited opportunities to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public or private industries in this sorry state of affairs , but for the sake of brevity I will limit my argument only to civil service recruitment . English is used as the only medium for both written and interview parts of civil service competitive examination . During my schooling , in a conventional government school I can recall how both the teachers and students felt equally perplexed while learning English . At the same time children my age at elite schools were already reading Shakespeare . With such a difference when a prowess in a foreign language becomes a decisive factor , knowledge , intellect and originality of thought are often buried somewhere deep . The Article 251 of the Constitution of Pakistan declares Urdu as the national language but in practice , English is the official language . In the civil service competitive examination , apart from an option of taking Islamic Studies papers in Urdu the entire civil service examination is conducted in English .

Several analysts argue about the quality of higher education responsible for this poor result but hardly anyone noticed that 92 percent of the total candidates simply failed in the compulsory English paper whose foundations are generally laid in schools , and not in institutions of higher education . The result also showed that the real competition was between only 8 percent of the total candidates who could cross the rubicon of English language . Should such an exclusionary application of English language be acceptable in a truly independent country whose constitution promises social justice for all citizens ? Before sounding judgemental I want to share the situation in some of our South Asian counterparts with whom we share a colonial past and institutional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitution the state language of Bangladesh is Bangla . The aspirants of a career in Bangladesh Civil Service ( BCS ) are required to take an 1100 marks competitive examination . Apart from a compulsory English paper of 200 marks , the entire examination is in Bangla language . This favours Bangla medium candidates to such extent that recently the English medium educational background candidates have demanded to give them an option of taking the BCS examination in English . Is this not diametrically opposed to our situation ? I In practice , English has ceased to be the language of officialdom in Bangladesh , but at least English is not the language of access to opportunities . <p> In India , Article 343 of the Indian constitution describes Hindi as the official language of the Indian Union . Like Pakistan and Bangladesh , English language is widely used in official business . But when it comes to access and opportunity , after some radical inclusionary steps taken quite recently , English language is no more a barrier for aspirants of a career in the civil service . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main examination in India , and the competence of English language is assessed through a 300 marks paper but astonishingly this is considered only a ' Qualifying Paper ' whose standard UPSC explicitly defines as ' Matriculation or equivalent ' and marks obtained in this paper are not counted for final ranking . The rest of the written examination and interview which decide a candidate 's position in order of merit can be taken in Hindi , English or any of the 22 regional languages listed in Schedule 8 of the Indian Constitution . Only a functional understanding of English is judged without eclipsing the prospects of success of the intellectually sound candidates who take examination in Hindi or even in their mother tongue . <p> A social order based on injustice leads to social unrest which makes conditions ripe for forces of extremism to exploit the situation . For a just social order the access to opportunities of upward social mobility should not be blocked by irrational barricades . Not only Urdu , but all the regional languages can also be made the medium of all types of recruitment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sector jobs .

( PCP ) Pakistani Prime Minister Shahid Khakan Abbasi has refused to talk about the country ? s blasphemy laws at the United Nations General Assembly . <p> He is currently in New York to attend the 72nd session of the United Nations General Assembly and was speaking at a session organised by U.S. think tank Council on Foreign Relations ( CFR ) . <p> Kenneth Roth , Director of the Human Rights Watch , raised the question whether he as a Prime Minister would speak out against the blasphemy laws , while NY Times correspondent David Sanger urged him to speak out on the issue as he is in a position of both great political and moral leadership . <p> But in his response , Mr Abbasi stated that the laws of the country are clear and refused to talk about them further by referring to the Pakistan ? s Parliament as a body responsible to amend the laws . <p> He also said that his role as a Prime Minister as being part of the Government is evolved around responsibility to stop misuse of the blasphemy laws . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to call for amendment of the draconian blasphemy laws was commented on social media as cowardice . <p> Nasir Saeed Director , CLAAS-UK has said that years of not addressing the issue of the blasphemy law has meant it has become a sensitive issue and even the prime minister of Pakistan is scared of making any comments . <p> He said : ? Mr Abbasi ? s role as Prime Minister is to provide political and moral leadership to the Parliament and therefore , we condemn the statement in which he refuses to urge the Parliament to take necessary actions for these laws to be repealed or at least substantially amended . <p> ? Importantly , his statement he says that his primary role as Prime Minister is to ensure that the laws are not abused or misused , but unfortunately these laws are being regularly exploited and many innocent people have been persecuted and prosecuted as a consequence. ? <p> In recent years the misuse of the blasphemy law has increased . There are a number of occurrences in which the blasphemy laws have been used or cited by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the law is being used as a tool for revenge , intimidation over petty disputes , or to settle personal grudges . <p> It is now considered an easy , quick and inexpensive way to settle personal scores and punish opponents , something which has been admitted by many religious scholars and political leadership . <p> There is a long list , but a very recent example of the exploitation of the blasphemy law is that Nadeem James has been sentenced to death after he was accused of sending a Muslim friend a blasphemous Whatsapp message , while he denies sending any such messages . Mishaal Khan ? s killing is another bad example , while Asia Bibi is about to complete her 3000th day in prison and there is still no sign of her case being heard . <p> Mr Saeed continued : ? The blasphemy laws are not being in compliance with international human rights standards is not the only concern . Their exploitation that leads to further violations of international human rights law is a further burden but the government of Pakistan has failed to address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not on their agenda , despite it being a matter of life and death. ? <p> There are reports about a large number of blasphemy cases being based on false accusations and the absence of investigation and prosecutions . The Supreme Court of Pakistan in a judgement in 2015 said that it is an unfortunate fact which can not be disputed that in many cases registered in respect of the offence of blasphemy , false allegations are levelled for extraneous purposes and in the absence of adequate safeguards against exploitation of such laws by motivated persons those falsely accused of the commission of that offence suffer beyond proportion or repair . <p> We urge Mr Abbasi to put this matter on his government ? s agenda , bring this issue to parliament , have a debate and then amend it accordingly to stop its ongoing misuse .

@@20750230 <h> How to increase red blood cells : foods to eat and lifestyle changes <p> ISLAMABAD : A low red blood count or anemia can cause feelings of fatigue and weakness . When people have a lower red blood count than normal , their body has to work overtime to get enough oxygen to the cells . This can leave a person feeling drained . <p> Low red blood cell count can cause a variety of symptoms and complications . <p> There are several diet and lifestyle changes that people can make to help the body increase the number of red blood cells . However , if symptoms persist , it is important to see a doctor . <p> Red blood cells are the most abundant cells in human blood . The cells contain hemoglobin , which is a protein that carries oxygen around the body . Hemoglobin is also responsible for the blood 's distinctive color . <p> Red blood cells will circulate in the body for an average of 115 days . After this , they go to the liver , where they are broken down , and their nutrients are recycled back into the cells . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marrow . If the body does not receive a regular supply of necessary nutrients , the red blood cells may become malformed or die off at a faster rate than the body can replace them . <p> Anemia can lead to serious complications that may be life-threatening if left untreated . <p> A low red blood cell count is usually due to low consumption of essential nutrients . Eating more nutrient-rich foods can give the body the necessary tools to create healthy red blood cells . <p> These vitamins and minerals can also be taken as supplements , although it is best to get nutrients straight from healthful foods . Try to consume foods rich in the following nutrients : <p> Iron is the nutrient most commonly associated with anemia . The body uses iron to make the hemoglobin that stores the oxygen in the blood cells . <p> Without iron , these cells can die or be unable to deliver oxygen to the body . Eating foods rich in iron can help prevent symptoms of anemia and keep the blood healthy . Sources of iron include , shellfish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fortified cereals , prune juice , tuna , beef , tofu , chicken liver , white beans , lentils . <p> Vitamin B-12 is important for brain function and creating new red blood cells . Low vitamin B-12 levels can prevent red blood cells from fully maturing . This deficiency can lead to abnormal red blood cells called megaloblasts , and a condition called megaloblastic anemia . <p> Vitamin B-9 is also known as folic acid or folate . It is an essential nutrient for the nervous system and adrenal glands and helps create new cells in the body . <p> While vitamin C does not directly affect the red blood cells , it is still important because it helps the body absorb more iron . Iron helps increase the number of red blood cells that the body can make . <p> Copper is an essential mineral that helps the body use the iron in the bloodstream . If there is not enough copper in the body , it can be difficult for the body to absorb the iron the blood cells need to survive . <p> Retinol , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cell count in a similar way to copper . It can help the cells absorb the iron they need to stay healthy . <p> Moderate exercise is beneficial for everyone , but it is especially important to create healthy red blood cells . <p> Sustained vigorous exercise that raises the heart rate causes the body and brain to need more oxygen . This is why the heart beats faster , and the lungs breathe deeper and quicker . <p> Understanding blood count : <p> Normal red blood cell counts vary from around 4.7 to 6.1 million cells per microliter ( ? L ) for men and 4.2 to 5.4 million cells per ? L for women . The normal count in children is 4.0 to 5.5 million cells per ?

@@20812239 <p> While CPEC is expected to lead to a reduction in logistics costs , this will not automatically translate into greater exports . Market access requires an examination of tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade too . The second phase of negotiations of the Pak-China Free Trade Agreement ( PCFTA ) are now under way . These negotiations were long overdue and considering our inability to make use of the first phase signed in 2006 , our domestic industry has a number of concerns . <p> Nevertheless , the question remains : what we should negotiate for and how we can benefit from this huge opportunity . Recently , I was involved in conducting some research on the subject , as part of a team sponsored by International Growth Centre . Our research attempted to provide some of the answers in Punjab 's context . <p> Let 's look at Pakistan 's agriculture exports . Textile and clothing make for more than half of our exports , followed by vegetables , accounting for 14% . Food products are the fourth important item in Pakistan 's exports , constituting almost 4% . As we can see , that not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top two food categories account for almost one-fifth of our exports . <p> Digging a bit deeper on our agricultural and agro-processed exports , we found a well-diversified basket of $4.06 billion , excluding cotton and livestock . Now out of this $4 billion+ , how much do we export to China ? Only a third of a billion dollars , with rice taking more than half , followed by the ' beverage , spirits and vinegar ' category , which takes another one-third . Although Pakistan 's agricultural exports to China spread over 14 broad product categories , most of them are very small or negligible . <p> What is even more interesting is that China imports $76 billion worth of goods in these categories , with Pakistan claiming merely half a per cent share . Since we are exporting these products elsewhere , we must be somewhat competitive and since China is importing them , we know that there is an established market next door . So , what exactly is happening here ? <p> Let 's look at the example of rice . Pakistan is one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exports of $1.9 billion in 2016 represented 5% of global rice exports . Rice exports to China , however , accounted for only 8% of this . On the other hand , China imported $1.4 billion worth of rice , with Pakistan getting only 11% share . From where did China get the rest ? Mostly Vietnam and Thailand with 3-5 times more rice exports than Pakistan . <p> Despite the fact that the bulk of China 's imports is in non-basmati rice , there is still significant room to increase our exports . But the major impediment is non-favourable tariffs . China maintains a special low tariff of 1% on import of a quota of 5.3 million tonnes of rice , however , beyond this quota , rice imports are subject to a tariff of 65% . The Asean countries , which are the top exporters of rice to China , enjoy preferential tariffs as a part of Asean-China FTA -- 20% on non-basmati and broken rice and 50% on tariff in basmati rice . In case of Pakistan , no preferential tariff is applicable on any rice category @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not the only one . Similar stories are there in other product categories such as citrus , fruit juices , vegetables , etc , where either tariff or non-tariff barriers are hindering our exports to China that would otherwise be made . <p> Such insights should drive the ongoing PCFTA negotiations with China . Fortunately , Punjab has taken up many of these issues with the federal government but other provinces need to do the same . And this exercise should go beyond agricultural products . The state can pave the way by negotiating better terms of trade for Pakistani exporters , while businessmen should explore why they are n't exporting more . <p> Once we tap these opportunities , we could look for other high demand areas in China , where we can potentially develop production capabilities from the scratch . But that remains a story for another day . 
@@20812240 <p> Naveed Iftikhar is a public policy practitioner and researcher . He tweets @navift <p> Last week , Indian and Pakistani delegations for the United Nations General Assembly ( UNGA ) meetings in New York were coining new phrases to blame each other such as " mother of terrorism " and " factory of terrorism " . There is something about the UNGA conference halls that creates an air of glamour and vigour so intoxicating , that the able representatives of the two mighty nations easily slip into their flair for dramatics and antagonistic antics against their immediate neighbours . <p> And yet , many of our friends and networks who have lived/studied/worked abroad can testify to a completely opposite behaviour when nationals of these two countries share space in a different context . The puzzle of Pakistan-India relations oscillates on two extremes of the spectrum . This experiential analysis aims to shed some light . Experiential , because it is based on the observations and experiences related to this phenomenon . We 'd urge students of international relations and diplomacy to use a more sophisticated methodology to study the same question . <p> Despite hostile relations between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries living abroad generally get along well with each other . They celebrate Eid , Diwali , Holi , birthdays , cricket matches , weddings and many other social events together . On the contrary , nationals from countries with whom Pakistan enjoys warm diplomatic relations , for example , China and Middle Eastern countries hardly cross paths socially . Drawing a similar comparison for India , the same phenomenon holds true in the case of Indo-Russian interaction . <p> While studying in the US , one of the authors observed that many Pakistani and Indian students used to work together on academic assignments . Students from both countries were often found in each other 's residences on social gatherings . On one occasion , one of the authors jokingly remarked to a fellow student who was rather popular among members of the fairer sex , on why he is so intimate with the people of an enemy country ? He smiled and responded , " I would never compromise on Pakistan 's stance with India but why should it stop me from developing friendships with beautiful people from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often hear about IT companies founded by Indians and Pakistanis who employ and even prefer talent from their hostile neighbours with absolutely no qualms about the status of diplomatic ties . <p> While studying in the UK and China , one of the authors observed that during seminar discussions involving the colonial past of the subcontinent and the policy debates featuring the dissent between the global North and South , Indian and Pakistani students share somewhat the same stance . The sentiment of colonial extractionary past and the sense of wrongdoing prevails on both sides of the border . <p> Social interactions also present a very interesting ground for research . People on both sides have a deep fascination about each other 's culture , including music . Indian students would greatly appreciate the latest in Pakistani Coke Studio , for example , while Pakistanis may defend the parenting skills of Kareena Kapoor with steadfast ferocity . <p> Personal accounts of the authors , and interactions with Indian students , academics , and professionals in the US , resulted in an understanding that there is definitely no terrorist in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian counterparts would confirm the same about Pakistanis . Moreover , in candid conversations , both Indians and Pakistanis will say that the governments of both countries should find a way to resolve all disputes peacefully and to let us cross the borders . <p> We discussed this paradox/puzzle with a few friends and they pointed to factors such as common language , culture , and the craving for the spicy food in both countries . Some also pointed out that as people from both countries ca n't meet each other in their home countries , they are highly curious and fascinated about interacting with their hostile neighbours when they do find such opportunities . <p> Nonetheless , some Pakistanis do point to biases and prejudices of Indians in professional environments . One of the authors had one such encounter in the US . While presenting a research paper on Gwadar in a conference , the discussion focused on how Pakistan and China were raising a new city on the pattern of Shenzen . Instead of a serious dialogue , an Indian academics started mentioning rifts in Balochistan . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to resort to pointing out separatist movements in India and their severity being more in comparison to the foreign-funded conflict in Baluchistan . <p> To be fair , one can say that there would be occasions where role reversals may occur . Pakistan and India take turns at being the antagonist . Personal accounts can be diverse ! Beyond experiential evidence , we 'd like to highlight last year 's skirmish between India and Pakistan after the Uri attack . As Pakistanis have suffered the conflict for a long time , the media and intelligentsia on this side were advocating to pursue peace and dialogue to resolve issues . While in India , the media and many leaders were trying to push their country to wage a war against Pakistan . There have been many attacks in Pakistan which were allegedly associated with India but Pakistanis still advocated peace and dialogue . The Pakistani state and people have been urging dialogue but the Indian state and intelligentsia have been making efforts to isolate Pakistan . We think there was a vivid contrast on this issue on the two sides of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emanate from this brief account of paradox of friendships between Pakistanis and Indians . Why people from the two countries continue to nurture friendships with each other when the two states are at war ? Is this an exception in the international world or does it hold true in other cases ? Despite such warm sentiments between people across the borders , why have people failed to convince the states to make peace with each other ? <p> However , the biggest takeaway of the above account is that both India and Pakistan should resolve their conflicts peacefully and should pave the way for prosperity and development in South Asia . It also points to the need of enhanced cultural interactions between China and Pakistan if they both are vying to build a long-term partnership for implementing China-Pakistan Economic Corridor . <h> Facebook Conversations <h> Reader Comments ( 1 ) <p> Well The hater is not in hearts actually it 's the line we draw on the Map of the world . i have heard so many stories about friendship between Indian and Pakistanis , They loved and enjoy each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our forefathers shared that space . Indians who visited Pakistan and Pakistani who visited India always share their great time they never said that they had bad time because people treated them badly .

We can agree to disagree without getting personal and hating everything the other side stands for <p> There 's a gut-wrenching moment in every divorce where mutual friends have to pick a side . Are you with him or her ? Your position hinges on who you became friends with first or the depth of your friendship with either party . Pakistani voters are also being asked to pick sides during a messy divorce between politics and policy in the country . That 's because parties are n't arguing substantive policy differences in their manifestos ; instead they 're highlighting political and personal disagreements . <p> Here 's an example : how many major policy differences can you identify between mainstream political parties ( PTI , PML-N , PPP ) when it comes to internal security , electricity or foreign policy with neighbours ? The differences lie in rhetoric ; not policy . All parties want friendly ties with neighbours , including India . All parties want to enhance electricity production , distribution capacity and predictability of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in society , allocate more budget for law enforcement agencies and support the military 's operations against extremists . <p> It 's not as if policy differences do n't exist at all .

The biggest difference pivots on corruption and accountability . PTI prioritises accountability whereas PML-N prioritises the stability of the democratic process and believes civil-military ties are the most important source of institutional break down in the country . So older voters will vote for status quo because they do n't like instability in their fortunes late in life whereas younger voters will vote for change because they 'll be alive long enough to benefit from accountability . Neither party 's voter is stupid ; they 're merely voting for self-interest . <p> If you take PTI and PML-N 's economic manifestos , they 're virtually interchangeable ; both believe in pro-investor policies and trickledown economics .

You can disagree on whether this is the right priority choice but it 's difficult to argue that they have n't delivered tangible goods . In context of realising most parties converge on policy priorities , it 's interesting to note that PML-N may have a better execution capability than PTI , partly because they know the system better or longer and that works to their advantage . <p> So what does all this mean as we head into elections ?

We can agree to disagree without getting personal and hating everything the other side stands for . Let 's do it for the kids ? We were in a marriage once .

Saudi women will no longer need their guardians ' permission to obtain a driving license nor need a man present with them in the car . <p> After decades of struggle to get the ban uplifted , people took to social media to welcome the landmark decision , which is part of new reforms in the conservative Kingdom .

One has to depend entirely on a man -- be it a mehram or a private driver -- to leave the house . <p> When I would try to make plans with my friends , our main concern always was how we would get to our meeting point . Most of the time , our plans would get cancelled for the simple reason that one of our fathers was too tired after work to take us anywhere .

During the ride , he revealed that he was Saudi but chose to wear this attire as he was aware of how women felt more comfortable with this apparel and hence preferred Pakistani drivers over local ones . <p> The only time I would have the liberty of driving was within the confines of my compound , which is a gated residential community designed specifically for foreigners . The laws of wearing an abaya , driving and gender segregation did n't apply within our safe haven , which is perhaps why Saudis were n't allowed to live in the compound and had to face many hurdles to even come inside .

Like a moth to a flame , Saudi men would begin to tail someone 's car if they saw ' unaccompanied ' women . <p> Some men would attempt to throw their numbers written on a small piece of paper , while several would yell out their digits . Others were either more tech-savvy or perhaps trying to promote sustainability while showing their number on a screen from their car window .

This made the simple act of walking across the street an incredibly daunting task . If I was ever dropped further away from the mall or restaurant I was going to due to traffic , I always felt uneasy . <p> Furthermore , Saudi men are also some of the most reckless drivers . They are notorious for excessive speeding and for not following any laws of traffic .

Saudi drivers could manage to break several laws and not be held accountable , with the authorities shrugging violations off as an everyday occurrence , which in fact it was . <p> Given these concerns , I ca n't imagine what the roads will be like when women start driving . Although I am extremely happy for Saudi women who have finally been granted their right , I am wary that it will be difficult to adjust to this change , whether it is in the minds of people or on the streets of Riyadh . <p> There is still a long road ahead for Saudis to adjust to their wives or daughters taking the car out for a spin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that women driving will be a reality .

Veteran actor Rasheed Naz reunites with Shoman a decade after terrorizing the audience as a Taliban leader ; the rest of the cast impresses in their capacity . <p> THE BAD <p> The word bad may be common in our dictionaries but not in Shoaib Mansoor 's who works on each line for days ; the absence of songs in the power-packed trailer can be termed as a put-off , considering the soundtrack of last two films is what made the trailer interesting .

Yes , she is a very talented , beautiful and expressive actor but what she has done in Verna is way ahead of others .

The minimal makeup , the explosive dialogues , the scenic locations and the amazing performances is what will make Verna the third blockbuster of the year . <p> VERDICT -- 4/5 <p> Mahira Khan has fans all across the world and Verna will be a treat for all those waiting to watch her on the big screen , especially after the Raees snub in Pakistan . Haroon Shahid reminds you of the young Junaid Jamshed who acted in a couple of TV plays ( count Geetar 93 as a performance ) . This film is Shoaib Mansoor 's third flick -- first after Bol in 2011 -- and his fans are anxiously waiting for the release date so that they can have an experience that others try to provide , while Shoman delivers .

@@21179233 <h> Parliament is the key to crises management : Pervez Malik <p> ISLAMABAD : Senate Secretary Amjed Pervez Malik , while briefing the Association of Secretaries General of Parliament ( ASGP ) , on Wednesday , said the parliament of Pakistan had dynamically taken legislative and deliberative initiatives to address challenging situations and overcome crises . <p> He said the ever changing dynamics of crises have necessitated multi-stratum responses at the state and international levels , pushing the national parliaments right to the centre of crisis management . Senate secretary presented his paper at the ASGP meeting being held simultaneously on the ' Role and workings of the parliament in crisis situations ' at the 137th IPU Assembly being held in Saint Petersburg , Russia . <p> Regarding parliaments ' role in crisis situations , senate secretary said that crisis management remained an unquestioned domain of the executive in the past , with parliaments , despite overseeing government action , given a limited role in many countries . He informed since the restoration of democracy in Pakistan in 2008 and democratic transfer of power from one elected government to another , the role of parliament increased in crisis management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said the success of anti-terror military campaigns , such as the 2009 Operation Rah-e-Rast , Operation Rah-e-Nijat , and the on-going Operation Radd-ul-Fasaad , had the complete backing , support and political consensus of the parliament . He remarked the parliament also played a front-runner role in putting in place a firm constitutional and legal framework through relevant constitutional amendments and new laws to address the threat of terrorism and extremism through legal dimensions . A National Action Plan had been chalked out which had crossed political parties , institutions , provincial lines or boundaries ownership , he said . <p> He said the recent Afghanistan policy speech by U.S. President Donald Trump , where he levelled false accusations against Pakistan and questioned its integrity in fighting terrorism in the region , created a bilateral and inter-state crisis situation . The first response to this crisis situation was a unanimous voice in both houses of the Pakistan Parliament , where parliamentarians rejected the Trump narrative and dubbed the accusations as baseless . However , it was senate which played a lead role in crisis handling , he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committee of the Whole , constituted to prepare policy guidelines in the light of emerging regional realities and the role of United States . The committee held extensive consultations with the foreign office and the defence ministry and came up with initial parliamentary response guidelines which steered Pakistan 's policy and diplomatic stance in the crisis situation , the senate chairman remarked . <p> He said , all Pakistan missions abroad were advised to share the senate 's guidelines and Pakistan 's perspective on the evolving situation . Moreover , as per the guidelines , a meeting of Pakistan ambassadors posted abroad was convened in Islamabad to formulate a comprehensive diplomatic response . And finally , a meeting of the Parliamentary Committee on National Security was convened to discuss the issue , he said . <p> The recent visits of the foreign minister to China , Turkey and United States were in tandem with one of the policy guidelines , was to initiate a regional diplomatic initiative in consultation with friendly countries , Malik said . <p> He further stated that Pakistan Parliament played an exemplary role in addressing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force 's attack on Pakistani security forces at two Pakistani military check-posts at Salala , resulting in 28 casualties of Pakistani troops , which threatened to derail Pakistan-NATO anti-terror cooperation in November 2011 . <p> However , Pakistan Parliament evolved a specialized institutional framework in this regard by constituting a special parliamentary crisis management and response forum in the form of Parliamentary Committee on National Security , Malik said . " A joint session of the parliament was convened passing a joint resolution " calling for an urgent review of the national security strategy and revisiting the methodology of combating terrorism in order to restore peace and stability through an independent foreign policy " , he said . The resolution also called for constituting " a special committee of parliament to periodically review , provide guidelines and monitor the implementation of the principles framed and roadmap given in this resolution , " he said . As a result , the Parliamentary Committee on National Security was constituted , Malik said . The committee held a total of 63 meetings averaging 16 meetings per year till March 2012 .

He informed that lawmakers approved a draft resolution proposing that Pakistan " should maintain neutrality in the conflict so as to be able to play a proactive diplomatic role to end the crisis " . Following parliamentary guidelines , Pakistan avoided becoming entangled in a regional crisis situation , that otherwise could have entailed serious diplomatic and bilateral consequences for Pakistan , he said . <p> The senate secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through collective political wisdom and institutional consensus , efficiently and amicably handled the crisis situations with positive results . He observed that individual dictator or solely executive-led handling of crisis minus parliament may bring about quick response or temporary solutions but lacked broader vision and deep wisdom that only parliament can guarantee . The institution of parliament can help bring about peaceful and mutually acceptable solutions to the crisis situations . He said the proactive role of the parliament in crisis handling has two dimensional advantages . Firstly , it helps executive of the country in sustaining undue pressure and not change policies on one telephonic call without taking the nation on board . On the other hand , the properly debated , deliberated and planned change of course by a nation is only possible through continuous parliamentary involvement and leading role . Otherwise , the fight against terrorism or any societal menace remains cosmetic and temporarily leading to contradictory situations , Malik explained . <p> In the end , the senate secretary proposed to the ASGP forum that the UN , multilateral organisations , and think tanks and media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parliament in addressing crisis situations . At the same time , IPU must strive for developing institutional mechanisms at the UN to facilitate enhanced parliamentary representation , and engagement in UN debates and proceedings relating to crisis resolution , he said . <p> Moreover , in addition to constitutional and legislative interventions , parliament must strive to conceive and bring into use specialised procedural ; devices and tools such as special committees and forums for crisis resolution , Malik further recommended .

His film ' Savera ' starring Shamim Ara and Kamal had a beautiful song " Tu Jo Nahi Hai Tou Kuch Bhi Nahi Hai " rendered by SB John with lyrics by Fayyaz Hashmi . Both Master Manzoor Hussain and singer SB John became immortal because of the beauty of this melody . After more than five decades of its creation , this melody remains resonant in our ears . Indian director Mahesh Bhatt lifted this song for his film ' Woh Lamhe ' in the music of Pritam many years later . He said in some interview that his mother loved this song , so he made some changes in the lyrics and recorded it in the voice of Glenn John , SB John 's son as SB John had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kangana Ranaut and Shiney Ahuja . This movie was believed to be based on the story of Indian actress Parveen Babi . <p> Manzoor Hussain tried his hands on another movie by dancer Hameed Chaudhary with Sultan Rahi and lyrics by Khawaja Parvez . I wonder if it was completed . By temperament Manzoor was not suited for films , so he spent all his life in Pakistan Television Corporation and Radio Pakistan until the age of 84 when he received the President of Pakistan 's prestigious civil award , the Pride of Performance . <p> Manzoor 's father 's name was Master Fazal Hussain . He was known as a competent sarangi player hailing from Shah Alami Gate , Lahore . This area where this family hailed from confirms the fact that they were residents of Lahore . Initially , Master Fazal Hussain lived in Mozang Chungi . Fazal Hussain was the pupil of Pyaare Khan of Gawaliar Gharana from whom he learnt the tricks of the trade . Pyaare Khan was the father of Umeed Ali Khan , so the style of singing of this school of thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach Mian Pyaare Khan to learn sarangi also despite that the latter was a vocalist . <p> Fazal had four sons ; Manzoor , Bashir Hussain , Imdad Hussain and music composer Altaf Hussain . The youngest son was a very melodious music composer . I have rendered many tunes composed by him for PTV and radio . Bashir Hussain was known as professor due to his knowledge of music . He deviated from the family tradition and became a pupil of Akhtar Hussain Khan of Patiala Gharana . Manzoor 's inclination on the other hand , was towards Gawaliar Gharana style of music . Often , Manzoor used to ask his brother Bashir jokingly to refrain from his tutelage , as he knew better than his brother 's Ustad . <p> When Manzoor was eight or nine years old , he was borrowed by Umeed Ali Khan from Fazal . Fazal could not refuse his teacher 's desire . So , Manzoor started his tutelage at the age of nine . Ustad purchased nine suits of the cloth boski for Manzoor ; a precious gift . Surprisingly the relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a father and son and not that of teacher-pupil one . <p> The daily riaz ( practice ) comprised training sessions through which it was taught to Manzoor as to what to reveal and what to conceal as was done in poetry writing centuries ago . It was due to this training that Manzoor knew how to accompany great instrumentalists on harmonium with naghma ( ascent and descent in one cycle of rhythm ) . In this connection , two anecdotes still resound in the music circles of Radio Pakistan , Lahore . <p> Manzoor 's pet name was Jhoora and Lamma . So he was often referred to as Jhoora Lamma . Once , Jhoora played a naghma with Ustad Allah Rakha , the great Indian tabla player on the latter 's visit to Pakistan . He had accepted Ustad 's invitation from someone in the audience to play naghma with him . Manzoor accepted the invitation . The over-confident Ustad remarked that he shall not be able to sustain the hissing of his ' Teen Taal ' snake movement . Jhoora played the naghma with his dikhana/chupana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complained to Jhoora 's maternal aunt that Jhoora had thrown ash on his head . <p> The second anecdote relates to the great Ustad Shaukat Hussain , tabla Player . Before a stage performance , Jhoora requested Shaukat Sahib for a rehearsal but was responded to with the famous sentence " Ankh Wala Tere Joban Ka Tamasha Daikhe " ( let the eye watch the drama of your prime ) . The result was similar to as in the former case narrated above . These anecdotes have been running in Radio Pakistan 's corridors since long . <p> Incidentally , Haddu Khan Hassu Khan duo was the proponents of Gawaliar School of thought in music and the duo was among the ancestors of Pyaare . That brings me to discuss here Gawaliar Gharana at length for its relevance . <p> According to Wikipedia , the Gawaliar Gharana is the oldest Gharana of Kheyal form of classical music . The rise of the Gawaliar Gharana started with the reign of the great Mughal emperor Akbar . The favourite singers of this pattern of the arts , such as Mian Tansen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He came from the town of Gawaliar . <p> During the era of Mughal emperors , Ustad Naththan Pir Bakhsh and his maternal grandsons were the legendary Haddu , Hassu and Natthu Khan . The main musician in the court at the time was Ustad Bare Muhammad Khan who was famous for his taan baazi ( notes ' embellishments ) . Both Ustad Bare Mohammad Khan and Ustad Naththan Pir Bakhsh belonged to the same tradition of Shahi Sadarang . <p> Manzoor Hussain 's father Master Fazal Hussain was a renowned sarangi player . The family lived at Shah Alam area of Lahore . Before Shah Alam , they had also lived in Mozang Chungi area <p> Some sources believe that Ustad Naththan Pir Bukhsh settled in Gawaliar and evolved the style features that led to this gharana . Others claim that individuals named Naththan Pir Bakhsh and Nathu Khan were the founders this gharana . The accepted version is that Naththan Pir Bakhsh left Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh to escape the professional rivalry with Ustad Shakkar Khan that had taken an ugly turn . He arrived in Gawaliar with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another great kheyal singer , also originally from Lucknow , was Ustad Bare Muhammed Khan , who brought the concept of Taan into kheyal singing . Haddu and Hassu further enhanced the style of the Gawaliar gharana as we recognise it today . Hassu died prematurely . Haddu 's sons , Rehmat Ali Khan and Ustad Bare Inayat Hussain Khan were widely acclaimed singers who liberated the Gawaliar style from the methodical form it followed to the emotional style that they preferred . <p> Later , it were the disciples of the duo Ustad Haddu / Hassu Khan that both preserved as well as propagated the art . For instance , their pupils Vasudeva Buwa Joshi , Ramkrishna Deva and Banne Khansaheb , spread it further . It was Ramkrishna Deva 's pupil Bal Ramkrishna Buwa Ichalnikar , who took the Gawaliari Gaeki ( singing style ) to Maharashtra . <p> However , the most beloved of the duo 's was Banne Khan , who was previously a dhurpad and dhamar singer from Amritsar . He took the art to Punjab and Sindh . It is said that he served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eldest son of the family . Later , when he had learnt the art to its perfection , the man trained a good number of pupils in Punjab and Sindh to carry it further .

Later , Banne became a musician at the court of the Nizam of Hyderabad . After him , Amir Khan too played an active role in spreading the art . He even taught the pupils of Balkrishna Buwa Ichalnikar . However , he later focused upon his four sons . Out of whom , Pyaare earned a great name . He introduced the kheyal genre in Afghanistan when he represented pre-partitioned India in Afghanistan on the second annual celebration of its independence on August 19 , 1992 . He became a court musician there and the teacher of another Afghan court singer , Qasim Afghan .

He received his early musical tutelage from his father , Shankarrao Pandit , who was a disciple of Ustad Haddu Khan and Ustad Nathu Khan -- the innovators of the Gawaliar style and then Nathu Khan 's son Nissar Hussain Khan . Benefiting from intensive training from his father , Krishna Rao 's regiment included pre-dawn practice in the woods to perfect swara , laya and breath control . He was taught wrestling , gymnastics , yoga and swimming to develop stamina , and a range of three octaves . <p> With such a rich background of this gharana , Manzoor was well trained by Pyaare . Manzoor needed lessons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhythmic part . His maternal grandfather Mian Nabi Bukhsh came handy and taught him the theory behind playing tabla and also how to play it . <p> With that background , one would have imagined Manzoor to become a classical singer or a tabla player .

He was amazed as to how Naushad Ali used a raag 's treatment , importance and health to compose a song in a given film situation .

However , now with the country entering an election year , and political polarisation intensifying following the disqualification of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif , all signs of a consensus seem to have evaporated . Major differences are coming out in the open . <p> The key disagreement seems to be on the scope of the proposed law . Initially , the three major political parties ( the PML-N , PPP and PTI ) had reportedly agreed to extend NACA 's scope to include officials of the military and judiciary by enlarging the definition of ' public office holder ' . The current accountability law had kept both institutions out of NAB 's reach . Lately , only the PPP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purview of the proposed accountability law as both the PML-N and PTI have publicly distanced themselves from the proposition . <p> Opponents of the proposed expansion hold that both the military and judiciary have their own internal systems to hold their respective officials to account , and that , therefore , the proposed expansion is uncalled for . Supporters for the inclusion of these institutions feel that the latter 's internal accountability mechanisms are not effective and have seldom been used for curbing corruption in military and judicial ranks . <p> Another major difference among political parties is over the territorial jurisdiction of the proposed law . The PPP and the Sindh government have already taken a strong position against the applicability of the current ordinance to Sindh by passing a law in the provincial assembly which effectively limits the scope of the NAO to federal government institutions and personnel . <p> Although the National Accountability Ordinance , 1999 , Sindh Repeal Act , 2017 , passed by the provincial assembly in August 2017 , has been challenged in the Supreme Court , the PPP is not ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's public office holders . Similarly , the KP provincial assembly had passed its own accountability law in the form of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Ehtesab Commission Act , 2014 , and the Ehtesab Commission was consequently established . The PTI , therefore , also supports PPP 's stand of limiting the territorial jurisdiction of the proposed accountability law to the federation only . On the other hand , the PML-N continues to advocate a national accountability law which is applicable to the provinces as well , as is the case with the NAO and NAB . <p> Political parties also differ over the effective date of the start of accountability . The PML-N reportedly suggested that the cut-off year should be 2007 and cases before 2007 should stay out of the scope of the proposed accountability law . The PTI wants accountability to start from 1985 . The current accountability law , the NAO 1999 , has a commencement date of Jan 1 , 1985 . <p> Two controversial provisions in the existing NAO apparently continue to stoke controversy in the proposed NACA as well . NAO 's Section 25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' . The Supreme Court had criticised these two provisions in the strongest terms and had even stopped NAB from taking voluntary returns of ill-gotten wealth in 2016 . <p> Although an authoritative text of the NACA is not available , PTI parliamentarians who are members of the parliamentary committee on the national accountability law have criticised the two provisions in the new law and termed them unacceptable . The PTI has also objected to a proposed provision that will reportedly give the right of bail to an accused who has been in custody for more than a year without the trial being concluded . <p> The three major parties also differ over other clauses pertaining to jurisdiction and powers of the accountability courts . There is a difference of opinion on the definition of such basic terms as ' corruption ' and ' corrupt practices ' . In addition , a consensus has yet to evolve over the federal government 's suggestion that cases of bankruptcy should be referred to the banking courts under the new law . <p> The differences over the proposed draft of the new accountability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a new accountability law . The party , instead , wants the current law to be amended . In fact , it may be a more realistic and prudent idea to amend NAO , 1999 , and drop its controversial provisions rather than seeking a consensus on a new law . As election time draws closer , it is becoming less likely that the political parties can secure a consensus on the proposed accountability commission act . 
@@21251231 <h> Email <p> IT 'S got to be saying something when the high point of your day is the fact that you have seen not one , not two , but three garbage trucks on your daily commute . All in one day , all piled high with trash , offering a drop of hope in the ocean of despair that is the country 's trash problem . <p> Pakistan is in general drowning under the weight of the trash it generates and can not seem to find a way of disposing of it correctly . This is not to say that this is n't a global problem . The waste generated by humanity and its activities is rapidly filling up the oceans , poisoning marine life that mistakes particles of plastic for food and ingests them , and creating vast landfills full of material that will take thousands of years to break down . <p> Several developing countries have become dumping grounds for throwaway material coming from the West , where a number of countries are not just the top generators of waste -- think about the layers upon layers of packaging used for everyday items in North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws about what can be dumped where are stringently imposed . Thus , humanity adds to the environmental pollution that has just been identified ( surprise , surprise ! ) as the cause of millions of deaths globally by ferrying around ships filled with trash to be cheaply ' disposed of ' in countries where the rules and regulations are less strict . <p> We are drowning under the weight of the trash we generate . <p> Pakistan , by the way , is one of these countries -- the recycling industry at Sher Shah in Karachi is underpinned by computer and electronic waste coming from abroad ; workers earn their wages through it , of course , but that also means that unnecessary amounts of harmful chemicals present in the parts , such as cadmium and lead , leach into the environment . <p> But to come back to the issue of Pakistan 's own waste . The problem is all too visible in Karachi , where even the poshest of areas are home to vast mounds of garbage that have nowhere to go . <p> These continue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities and sets the garbage on fire . And then , of course , large toxic clouds of ugliness are generated . This being the situation in the more upmarket areas in the city , that which prevails in the less fortunate parts has to be seen to be believed . A much-talked about news photo a few years ago showed a boy diving into the Lyari ' river ' , the surface of which appeared to be not water or sewage or even anything liquid , but a huge morass of compacted waste , mainly that most evil of inventions , the plastic ' shopper ' . <p> Karachi has reportedly recently outsourced at least some of its garbage collection needs to a Chinese company , and in the area where I commute I have seen a few newly installed dustbins that have Chinese lettering on them . So did the trucks that I saw . <p> But I have been unable to find an answer to the greater question : picking up the garbage is one thing , but where is all of it going to go ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press that the landfills serving the city are full and , in fact , have been so for years . Waste that is taken there has to be compacted by bulldozers , and even then , it is set alight from time to time for whatever good that might do . But I have heard or read nothing about the establishing of new landfills ; in any case , landfills are not a very efficient solution to waste disposal problems since they eat up greater and greater chunks of land around urban areas , and it takes years for the land to be rehabilitated for any other use . <p> Those who care enough about Karachi and the country 's garbage problem , though , can themselves play a significant role . To begin with , citizens can themselves fairly easily significantly reduce the amount of waste their own households generate -- as a first step , by declining to use polythene shopping bags as often as possible . There may be a need to use a bag in which to carry home eggs , for example , but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes wrapped in plastic -- certainly does not require one . A reusable cloth bag or jute basket -- remember those days ? -- can be used . Especially for those people who transport goods in a car or on a bike , a large carton makes better sense than polythene ; at least it decomposes faster and can be reused . <p> Those with the awareness to see the problem need to make themselves responsible for at least some part of the solution . Ask yourself , how many times have you on city roads seen a hand reach out of the window of an expensive car to throw out an empty packet of crisps ? <p> From time to time provincial governments have tried to ban polythene bags of various thickness ; why does the citizenry not take responsibility ? 
@@21251233 <h> Email <p> PROVISIONAL census results show Lahore district 's population at 11.1 million people . This is up from 6.3m in 1998 , through an average annual growth rate of three per cent . To accommodate these extra 4.8m individuals , the city 's built area has grown from 32,700 hectares ( 80,803 acres ) in 2000 to nearly 40,000 hectares ( 98,842 ) in 2017 . Bounded by the toxic swamp once known as river Ravi on one side , much of the city 's expansion in the built area has taken place towards the Indian border in the east , and towards Kasur and Okara in a south-western direction . <p> That Lahore 's expansion has hastened a number of environmental challenges is a fact worth repeating endlessly . The water table has dropped rapidly over the last decade , falling by up to nine metres in some neighbourhoods . Drinking water safety too has suffered , with dangerously high arsenic content in a majority of samples taken across the city . Air quality has perhaps been the biggest victim with nitrous oxide content recorded as high as 332mcg/cubic metre , a full 290 mcg/cubic metre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year . <p> Many people have written about Lahore 's suburban expansion led by DHA phases , LDA housing societies , Bahria Town , and hundreds of other imitations . Underpinning this growth is a century-old cultural and aesthetic logic that consecrates and deifies suburban lifestyles . Since Lahore 's growth under colonial rule , ie outside and away from its historical walled confines , detached and sprawling houses have been associated with prosperity and elite status . The old civil lines neighbourhoods surrounding what was then called Donald town were developed to provide housing to colonial administrators and segments of the local elite . The most privileged officials back then , as is the case now , took up quarters in the leafy and insulated confines of GOR . Even the military built sprawling bungalows for its commissioned ( usually white ) officers further east in Napier cantonment . <p> There will be no day when the entitled wake up and decide that they can live equally well in smaller residences . <p> As historian William Glover documents in his book , Making Lahore Modern , collaboration between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a new ethos of urbanisation that was thought to be modern and forward-looking , a world away from the derelict condition of its old walled city . This conception of modernity , partly encapsulated by a stand-alone , gated house connected to the world beyond its walls through wide roads continues to this day . <p> From the land grab of evacuee property that ensued after Partition in 1947 , to the development of new suburbs such as Shadman , Gulberg , and Garden Town by the city government in the 1950s and 1960s , all the way to our contemporary DHA-dominated era , the relationship of prosperity with outsized residences remains largely intact . <p> On its own , the upper class moving to sprawling residences built in the city 's suburbs is not a unique feature . This has happened at various points in the historical development of metropolises like London and Paris as well as most of urban United States . What makes Pakistan 's case particularly challenging is the filtering of this suburban ideal down from the elite to the more squarely middle class as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land development was structured in a way that houses equal to or bigger than 500 square metres ( roughly one kanal ) were accessible only to the top one per cent of earners , the rate of built-area growth would taper off . However , in contemporary Lahore , owning a 500-square metre property is a desirable ( and often an achievable ) goal for as much as 10pc of all households . Those unable to attain this size-based metric of mobility within their lifetimes make do with 250-square metre houses , but bequeath their subsequent generation with the same ideal . <p> In Lahore , and urban Pakistan in general , basic social facets such as prestige , status , even marital opportunities are tied to owning a detached , gated house in a desirable neighbourhood . One by-product of this is that real-estate projects catering to middle-class buyers or investors , design their developments to imitate those at the top of the market , replete with unsustainable green spaces and wide , car-accommodating boulevards . Another by-product , one closely tied with the growth of automobile ownership , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irrelevant . This helps explain why people are more than happy to move 25 kilometres south and an hour 's commute each way for a bigger property . <p> From a policy perspective , the cultural/aesthetic preferences of Lahoris will not change on their own . There will be no day when the entitled wake up and decide that they can live equally well in smaller residences . Therefore , any change for the better can only be enforced by a government willing to both penalise suburban sprawl through higher property taxes and fines on unoccupied land , and encourage high-density , vertical development closer to the city centre . <p> Unfortunately , this is unlikely to happen any time soon : gains made from converting arable land into plots by developers , real-estate investors , politicians , military personnel and bureaucrats are far too lucrative . Individuals involved in every step of this profit-making enterprise face an incentive structure that pushes them to replicate it constantly . Politicians are either investors in such schemes , or promote them unhindered to retain their financiers and funders . The military maintains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employed and to make a tidy profit for itself . Businessmen and household savers alike see it as the safest possible investment , with little regulation and guaranteed returns . In short , the economics of land development is intertwined with its politics , with each reinforcing the other in a vastly sub-optimal cycle <p> Those who wish to see a cleaner , healthier city are thus doubly straitjacketed . The political economy of profiteering from land development has combined with the cultural preferences of prosperous and upwardly mobile Lahoris to plunge us headfirst into unmitigated environmental disaster .

@@21427238 <h> Lawsuit targets Trump 's rollback of birth-control rule <p> Two national advocacy groups filed a federal lawsuit in Indiana on Tuesday challenging a rule change by President Donald Trump 's administration allowing more employers to opt out of no-cost birth control for workers . <p> The suit was filed on behalf of five women at risk of being denied birth control coverage , including three University of Notre Dame students . <p> The Catholic university in northern Indiana recently told staff and students that it planned to halt no-cost contraceptive coverage starting next year . <p> The National Women 's Law Centre and Americans United for Separation of Church and State filed the lawsuit in the local US District Court . <p> Under new rules issued October 7 by the US Department of Health and Human Services , employers and universities are allowed to cite religious or moral objections in order to end birth control coverage that was available under President Barack Obama 's Affordable Care Act . <p> The lawsuit argues that the new rules which have been assailed by many women 's rights and reproductive rights activists violate the equal protection and due process guarantees of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Care Act . <p> " Blocking access to basic health care that 99 per cent of women use at some point in their lives is unlawful , discriminatory and harmful , " Fatima Goss Graves , CEO of the women 's law centre , said in a statement . <p> " Everyone deserves birth control coverage , no matter where they work , how they are insured , or where they go to school . Our lawsuit aims to shut down this latest assault by President Trump on women 's health , equality , and economic security . " <p> The lawsuit 's other plaintiffs are an employee at a university in Illinois and an employee at an Indiana church whose insurance provider objects to some forms of birth control . <p> The church employee , Alicia Baker , said she was a seminary graduate as well as a member and employee of her church . <p> " I believe taking birth control in no way violates my religious beliefs , " she said .

PHOTO : REUTERS <p> The relationship between the US and Pakistan today is the diplomatic equivalent of a miserable marriage , where neither partner is ready to divorce the other , yet there is persistent bickering . <p> Ca n't live with each other , ca n't live without each other either . <p> Earlier this year , Islamabad watched with anxiety and horror as President Donald Trump called on India to deepen its influence in Afghanistan in his speech outlining the Afghan policy . India 's presence in Afghanistan has been a long time worry for Pakistan , and Trump 's speech earlier this year only reinforced that fear . <p> By pitting two arched enemies against each other , President Trump aimed to draw greater favours from both countries -- a policy tried and tested by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miraculously rescued an American woman and her family from the Haqqani network , and President Trump tweeted his approval the very next day . <p> Starting to develop a much better relationship with Pakistan and its leaders . I want to thank them for their cooperation on many fronts . <p> The downward spiral of the US-Pakistan relations dramatically took an upward turn , but this is hardly comforting . We have been here before . <p> Phases of active cooperation , visits by delegations and strong promises raise hopes on both sides , and then something outrageously silly happens , tipping the scales , heralding a new round of the blame game . <p> When President Barack Obama assumed office in 2009 , he was keen to refocus on the war in Afghanistan . He deployed more troops in the region and offered Pakistan more than $7 billion in civilian aid packages . He wanted to turn the Bush era , security driven , transactional relationship with Pakistan into a deeper strategic partnership by strengthening the civilian democracy in the country . His efforts , however , did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Raymond Davis shot and killed two Pakistanis in Lahore . President Obama 's initial reluctance to admit that Davis was indeed a Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) agent , and his subsequent release , caused an outrage in the country . <p> The dust had n't settled yet when the US Navy Seals captured and killed Osama bin Laden in an Abbottabad compound . Bruised , angry and hurting , Pakistanis mulled over their country 's sovereignty . Islamabad had n't quite recovered from the fallout when North Atlantic Treaty Organisation ( NATO ) helicopters accidentally killed 24 Pakistani soldiers at Salala the same year . <p> It took eight months of going back and forth on negotiations , and finally , a formal apology from the Secretary of State , Hillary Clinton , for Pakistan to reopen the NATO supply line . <p> Pakistan 's denunciation of the American leadership reached a record low as nine out of 10 of its citizens ( 92% ) expressed disapproval of President Obama 's presidency . Pakistan 's confidence in American presidents has historically stayed low . According to Pew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60% of Pakistanis have expressed no confidence in the US leadership , from President Bush to present . <p> The relationship has n't truly recovered yet . Pakistan , named a " major non-Nato ally " by President Bush , is consistently losing US favours . An already questionable US aid is fast plummeting due to Islamabad 's inability to satisfy Washington 's insatiable demand to " do more " . <p> Pakistan is wary of this demand . After losing over 80,000 people as a direct result of growing terrorism in the country post 9/11 , and bearing losses of over $120 billion , a majority of Pakistanis suspect that the US has no real interest in the country 's development . <p> US suspicions are also whetted over Islamabad 's reluctance to deal with the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani network . President Bush had suspected during his time in the Oval Office that Pakistan was either incapable or negligent about uprooting the Taliban from the region all together . He wrote in his memoire , Decision Points , <p> Pakistan 's reluctance to control the influence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence in Afghanistan . During his visit to the US in 2010 , General Pervez Musharraf said , <p> " If I 'm allowed to be very , very frank , India 's role in Afghanistan is to create an anti-Pakistan Afghanistan . There are consulates in Kandahar and Jalalabad ( which ) are actually involved in creating trouble in Pakistan . They have no other role . " <p> And so , for President Trump to formally call upon India to strengthen its presence in Afghanistan , and strongly rebuke Pakistan 's inability to crack down on terrorism spawning within its territory , has considerably angered Islamabad . The National Security Committee , in its rebuttal to the speech , blamed the US for failures in the war in Afghanistan , and declared , <p> " To scapegoat Pakistan will not help in stabilising Afghanistan . In fact , being its immediate neighbour , Pakistan has an abiding interest in peace and stability in Afghanistan . " <p> This , too , is a place where we have been before . <p> The US has historically used Pakistan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9/11 , President Bill Clinton 's visit to India signalled warming ties with the country but Pakistan , with its new military government under Musharraf , was a virtual non-entity . <p> After months of uncertainty , the US announced that President Clinton would also visit Pakistan , though only for a few hours . A visit to India alone would have left Pakistan feeling snubbed . Musharraf allegedly secured the US state visit by guaranteeing President Clinton a live televised address to the nation . And so , in an unprecedented move , President Clinton addressed Pakistanis for 15 minutes , chastising the country for supporting insurgency in Indian-occupied Kashmir . There was nothing promising for an ordinary Pakistani . It was once again , a detached , impersonal , cold American president , scolding them to get their affairs in order . <p> Now , President Trump is reaching out to India in order to coerce Pakistan to behave . By deepening ties with India , the Trump administration also wants to counteract China 's growing influence in the region . <p> Pakistan , however , is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the US . More recently , it invited Washington 's wrath over the release of Hafiz Saeed -- wanted by the US over masterminding numerous terrorist attacks , including the 2008 Mumbai attacks . Saeed has a $10 million reward on his head . But despite this , he announced , fresh out of detention , that his party Jamaat-ud-Dawa ( JuD ) will contest the next general elections in Pakistan . Talk about adding barrel loads of fuel to President Trump 's fire of Islamophobia . <p> When it comes to Muslims , President Trump is n't exactly a fan . As a Muslim majority country , Pakistan closely watched his election campaign and is fully aware of him retweeting Islamophobic videos earlier this year . Most recently , Trump 's announcement to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel created an uproar in Pakistan . So , after all this and more , even if he conjures a magic wand and miraculously strengthens American ties with Islamabad , President Trump would still stay a ' he-who-cannot-be-trusted ' for a majority of Pakistanis . <p> The clock is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a recent visit to Islamabad , said he believes in finding a " common ground " for cooperation . Pakistan should seize the moment and redesign a proactive foreign policy for the region by collaborating with the US for some concrete confidence building measures . <p> There are only so many times that you can pass through the same point without realising that you are stuck in a maze , and a relationship as fractious as this can only take so many blows before it collapses all together .

@@22468233 <h> Double standards lower prestige of judiciary <p> The controversy that surrounded the SC decision in Panama case disqualifying the former Prime Minister was not without cogent reasons which indicated and reinforced the impression that it was meant to target the Sharif Family and Nawaz Sharif . The circumstances surrounding the filing of the case in the SC and the unusual developments that took place during the hearing of the case and the investigations held by the controversial JIT manifestly suggested that something was unusual about the whole affair . <p> If there was any doubt about that impression it has now been removed with the decision by NAB to hold an inquiry into the companies owned by 435 Pakistanis in the tax havens of Panama and British Virgin Islands . Honestly speaking the Panama case did not fall within the purview of the Supreme Court in the first instance in the presence of other constitutional and legal institutions created through the acts of the parliament to deal with such cases like FIA , FBR and NAB . Assuming that the money taken out of the country to establish off-shore companies was illegal and accumulated through tax evasion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature and fell under the jurisdiction of the foregoing institutions for investigations and legal actions against those found to have indulged in illegal practices to establish those companies . <p> And if the SC thought that it could try the case by invoking its jurisdiction under article 184(3) to accept and try it then why did it only confine itself to trying only Nawaz Sharif and his family and leaving the rest to be probed by NAB and other state agencies established for the purpose ? . Another very pertinent point alluded to by many legal and constitutional experts is that article 184(3) could be invoked by the SC only in cases where violation of fundamental rights was involved and not in criminal acts committed by certain individuals . <p> The revelation by Imran Khan in an interview with a Private channel after the SC verdict that he was asked by Justice Khosa and the then CJ on telephone to bring the case to them for adjudication also reinforced the feelings regarding the witch-hunt syndrome . Astonishingly the registrar of the SC only issued a rebuttal of what Imran Khan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very serious . What Imran had revealed and in view of the rebuttal issued by the SC there were two possibilities . Either Imran Khan was telling a lie or the Judges of the SC were trying to conceal the facts . In either case it warranted a thorough probe into the affair and if as a result of the inquiry thus held Imran was found lying then he should have been proceeded against under the relevant law for maligning and soiling the reputation of the judges . And if Imran was found telling the truth then a reference against those judges should have been sent to the Supreme Judicial Council . But nothing of the sort happened and the SC kept a mysterious silence on the issue , further precipitating the steak of suspicion . <p> The disqualification or otherwise of the members of the parliament under article 62 and 63 falls within the jurisdiction of the ECP . Only the ECP could deal with the cases where a question regarding disqualification of a member of the parliament arises , in accordance with the procedures laid down under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chose to take this case of political nature by undermining the jurisdiction of the other state institutions and the ECP also remains to be answered . <p> The decision ultimately announced was also not a marvel of jurisprudence in the eyes of the constitutional and legal experts who felt that it had not added to the prestige of the apex court . The court did not disqualify Nawaz Sharif on the basis of the prayers and reasons given by the petitioners in their petitions seeking his removal but found a reason of its own to disqualify him . All the foregoing factors aggravated the impression that the case was all the way a witch-hunt against Nawaz Sharif . <p> The reaction by the PML ( N ) and Nawaz Sharif over the decision of the SC was therefore not misplaced . Though in deference to SC the verdict was immediately implemented but Nawaz Sharif and party were very much within their constitutional and legal right to criticize the decision for its infirmities . <p> Regrettably in the decision in the disqualification cases of Imran Khan and Jahangir Tareen , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself in the Panama case . In spite of the irrefutable similarities in both the cases the decisions are astonishingly different from each other . Imran admitted that he had availed the amnesty to whiten his black money but in spite of that he was declared ' sadiq and ameen ' . The court held that he had not derived any financial benefit by not mentioning his asset whereas Nawaz Sharif was denied the benefit of the same reasoning . Nawaz Sharif also had not derived any financial benefit nor escaped any liability by not mentioning the salary that he never drew . One does not have to be a constitutional expert to notice the dichotomy . It is quite visible and any person endowed with common sense can see through it . <p> It is probably due to the doublestandards exhibited by the SC in this case that it has also come under severe criticism by the constitutional and legal experts and political analysts like the verdict in Panama case . Even the former CJ Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry could not resist the temptation to remark that both the cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sharif was denied the same . <p> In delivering the decisions in both cases the SC unfortunately put aside all the internationally recognised principles of jurisprudence , particularly the principle of restraint without realising the consequences of the decisions . The disqualification of Nawaz Sharif has surely done a lot of harm to the country economically and politically by creating an ambience of uncertainty . The country has already suffered tremendously due to wrong decisions of the apex court judges legitimising martial laws and allowing the dictators to decimate the constitution through amendments of their own choice . <p> Judiciary undoubtedly is the most sanctimonious institution of the state and it is incumbent upon the judges of the apex court to uphold that sanctity through their decisions delivered strictly in accordance with the constitution and laws of the country rather than relying on subjective factors and considerations . Doublestandards practiced by the Judiciary lower its prestige . Therefore the Baba needs to shun activism and playing to the gallery in its own as well as the larger interest of the country .

The biggest outfits on Facebook were Ahle Sunnat Wal Jamaat ( ASWJ ) with 200 pages and groups , Jeay Sindh Muttahida Mahaz ( JSMM ) with 160 , Sipah-i-Sahaba ( SSP ) with 148 , Baloch Student Organisation Azad ( BSO-A ) with 54 and Sipah-e-Muhammad with 45 . Lashkar-e-Jhangvi ( LeJ ) , Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ) , Tehreek-e-Taliban Swat , **36;129;TOOLONG , Jamat-ul-Ahrar also have a smaller but strong presence . The report suggested that a majority of these users appeared to be based in larger urban centres such as Karachi , Lahore , Peshawar and Quetta .

The FIA reportedly compiled a list of 33 social media users for carrying out propaganda against the army and the news of such repressive measures made global headlines . <p> In June an Anti-Terrorism Court ( ATC ) sentenced a man to death for sharing blasphemous content about Islam on social media . It first glance the report read like news from Iran or Saudi Arabia . This is the current state of our laws , and the state of how blood hungry our society is when it comes to debate over religion ( and even over the military ) . <p> The final straw on the camels already broken back was the viral video of a senior Pakistani army officer distributing money to anti-government protesters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the " soft spot " the military is believed to have for religious groups , even when were clearly challenging the writ of the state . <p> Earlier this month , technology and social media were blamed for a rise in HIV rates in Pakistan . Not that contraception is taboo , or that there is a serious problem of non-consensual sex and abuse in Pakistan- but that online communication directly caused AIDS . Another example of how ham-fisted our understanding is of technology and how far we can go to blame anything other than our own violent selves and values . <p> I have written before , that I do not see social media as a positive force . It is an echo chamber the loudest and brashest of us all ; it is a tool to be manipulated ( as it has been with countless blasphemy allegations ) . If society is sick , social media will show us a sick picture it . If the state can crackdown on dissent on the streets , it can on the Internet too . This is not to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to censoring free speech . But there has to be some real movement towards creating a basis for a nonviolent society and leaders ( religious and otherwise ) who can handle dissent without protesters occupying capitals and without inexplicable abductions . <p> Many a sane Pakistani probably knows that Islam does not need protection , especially not on social media . More resources to protect people from hunger , brutality and exploitation would protect Islam by proxy . <p> Most sane Pakistani 's probably also understand that the military does not need protection as the strongest and most loved state institution . Its criticism is needed and is marginal . As the best of the best , the military should be above responding to any criticism . Positive or negative public opinion has no real effect on its actual function of physically protecting Pakistani lives and territory . <p> But we do n't live in sane times , and we do n't live with sane people . Social media in 2017 was an apt reflection of our times . Here 's to hoping for less blasphemy accusations that can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of social media warriors in 2018 . Social media , and a mainstream media , need dissenters and debaters , no matter the topic , to create better ideas for change and reform . It is time we start protecting living breathing people more than we protect institutions .
