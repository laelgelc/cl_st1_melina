Adams quickly filled them from Federalists ranks , their appointments being confirmed the following day by the Senate and their commissions issued . This aroused indignation and protest among the anti-Federalists , who called them " midnight judges . " <p> Through inadvertence , the commissions of 42 appointees were not delivered and they could not sit on the bench . When Jefferson became President , he ordered the withholding of 17 commissions , which he considered nullities for they were " crowded in by Mr. Adams after he knew he was not appointing for himself . " William Marbury and three others were among them , and they brought a suit in the Federalist-leaning Supreme Court for a writ of mandamus to order James Madison , the Secretary of State , to deliver their commissions . <p> Jefferson was prepared to disregard the mandamus order to be issued by the court and to impeach Marshall for Federal partisanship . Marshall declared that Marbury had a vested right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law granting the Supreme Court authority to issue writs of mandamus was unconstitutional because it was not among the cases upon which the Constitution conferred original jurisdiction on the court . By this process , he declared that the Supreme Court had the authority to declare laws of Congress invalid when in violation of the United States Constitution . <p> Technically , the case was decided in Jefferson 's favor , but Marshall had adroitly established the judicial sanction for the American doctrine of judicial review . <p> But is the decision of the Supreme Court always correct ? <p> The reasoning of Marshall has been repudiated by many constitutional commentators , yet its influence continues ( this and the foregoing antecedents on Marbury v. Madison are found in Marke , Vignettes of Legal History , Rothman &amp; Co. , 1965 , Pages 1-18 ) . <p> There is also a debate over whether a judge should follow the original intent of the framers of the Constitution or is free to disregard it . Even St. Thomas Aquinas , quoting Aristotle , is cited on the matter of relevance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the three branches of government clash with each other , since they are abstract beings , not persons of flesh and blood . If the members of a branch act along party lines and they are in the majority or in control of the department , then the confusion arises that it is the institution which is involved . <p> Nevertheless , American constitutional history records that US President Andrew Jackson was angered by a decision of Marshall ( again ) , and allegedly burst out : " John Marshall has made his decision , now let him enforce it . " US President Abraham Lincoln ignored the decree of Chief Justice Roger Taney in the case of Ex Party Merryman during the Civil War . Jefferson impeached two Federalist judges and started proceedings against Justice Samuel Chase and had Marshall lined up in his sights . Roosevelt attempted a court-packing law . <p> This is the real meaning of the principle that the three departments " check and balance " one another . When personalities abuse their power and are guilty of fraud , corruption and violence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call them into account . <p> Rule of law <p> When persons holding the reins of power are guilty of overreaching and tyrannical conduct , they are accused of violating the rule of law . <p> The late Justice Claudio Teehankee Sr. , in a dissenting opinion ( Aquino Jr . v. Military Commission No. 2 1975 ) , stated that " as defined by Knovitz , ' the Constitution and the laws enacted by the legislatures and the judgments and orders of the courts constitute the rule of law . ' " <p> Contraposed against the rule of law is the idea of " mob rule " and denial of due process . But a more benign expression is " people power . " <p> It is said that the three branches of government are heavily populated by lawyers , a profession with a code of ethics . And when they become judges there is a code of judicial ethics . <p> We may touch on lawyer 's associations , which are established primarily to discipline their members . They may voice their concern on national issues , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partisanship . Sometimes they stand up against any of the branches of government which cross the line into illegality . Salus populi est supreme lex . <p> In the not too distant past , magistrates showed that they were not insensitive to criticism . When lawyers became too vocal or rebellious they were " gently " browbeaten with the threat that while their cases may succeed on clear legal points , the judge has much leeway in areas of " judicial discretion . " <p> Independence <p> It is a classic expression that the judiciary has " neither the purse nor the sword , " so it is , for practical purposes , the weakest branch . <p> Thus , the long tenure and judicial review , to ensure its independence and survival . <p> There were times when the Supreme Court took a brave stand against the other branches , and was roundly applauded by the people . <p> In 2006 , it struck down a maneuver called the people 's initiative which would have installed the parliamentary system and perpetuate then President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo in power ( Lambino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can lead to judicial abuse . The courts can turn the tables on the other departments in the name of the rule of law and strike down their interpretation of what the law should be . <p> Whether the courts can command the respect of the people -- whether they have credibility -- will depend on the stature and prestige of individual judges and justices . In 1952 , US President Harry Truman seized the steel mills to settle a strike which was affecting the government 's Korean War efforts . The US Supreme Court declared his acts unconstitutional because Congress had not authorized it . Truman accepted the decision . <p> Just as transparency and freedom of information are demanded of all government institutions , all courts must be perceived as squeaky-clean and free of cover-up and hanky panky . <p> Many terms have been used to describe how the judiciary can enjoy the people 's support even against the two other branches -- through moral authority , high public esteem , independence and autonomy , and legitimate power to decide . <p> If judges fail to rise to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be tempted to intervene -- after all Article 2 , Section 1 of the 1987 Constitution says that sovereignty resides in the people and all government authority emanates from them . <p> In the United States there are confirmation hearings in the Senate covering the candidates ' personal life , professional competence and ideological leanings . There is also a great deal of interest in law schools and not too lukewarm media coverage . <p> Impeachment <p> This topic is no longer unfamiliar to the Philippine public . For the more curious , the case of Francisco Jr . v. Nagmamalasakit na mga Mananangol etc. ( 2003 ) is a veritable juridical tower of Babel . There were 18 petitions concerning the second impeachment complaint against Chief Justice Hilario Davide , a majority opinion , six separate opinions , two concurring and dissenting opinions , a separate concurring and dissenting opinion , and a separate and concurring opinion . <p> Impeachment is found in Article 11 of the Constitution on " Accountability of Public Officers . " Section 2 limits the respondents to the officials holding the greatest power and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Supreme Court , members of constitutional commissions and the Ombudsman . The grounds are specified and are called " high crimes , " to distinguish them from the common ones in the Penal Code and special penal laws . Section 3 provides that the exclusive power to initiate proceedings resides in the House of Representatives while the Senate shall have the sole power to try and decide the case . The judgment is limited only to removal and disqualification to hold office . <p> One of a kind <p> Thus , it is sui generis , or one of a kind , to distinguish it from the common run of criminal cases resulting in the penalties of imprisonment and fines . That it is found in the Constitution and is not a common crime reveals its true character -- it is for the protection of national interest . <p> The same article allows the House and the Senate to adopt their own rules of procedure . Being drafted by lawyers , they make references to the rules of criminal procedure and of evidence . Technical matters are mentioned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probable cause and rules on admissibility of evidence . <p> A crafty defense lawyer will see at once that these are fertile grounds for raising issues which may lead to the derailment , if not dismissal , of an impeachment complaint . For he can use a contrary ruling to invoke the " expanded certiorari jurisdiction " of the Supreme Court . <p> Whether the Senate will accede to the interference by the Supreme Court is an interesting question , especially after the senator-judges donned their new robes . <p> As to the persuasiveness of evidence there is mention of preponderance of evidence , clear and convincing evidence , proof beyond reasonable doubt and substantial evidence . <p> But when a senator casts his vote for conviction or acquittal , it will only be between him and his conscience to distinguish whether he acted on preponderance or reasonable doubt or whatever . The idea of proof beyond reasonable doubt comes into the picture because of the reference to the Rules of Criminal Procedure , although the procedure in civil and criminal trials are substantially the same . Not that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a motion for reconsideration and the judgment of the Senate can not be reviewed by the courts . <p> What law does the Senate apply when it renders judgment ? Many of the grounds are well-defined in the Penal Code and special criminal laws , but culpable violation of the Constitution , other high crimes and betrayal of public trust can cover a multitude of sins . <p> Political offenses <p> The constitutionalists use scholarly and grandiose language . US President Alexander Hamilton observed that the offenses " are of a political nature which may with peculiar propriety be denominated political , as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself . " US Justice Joseph Story described them as " political offenses , growing out of personal misconduct or gross neglect , or usurpation , or habitual disregard of the public interests , various in their character ... " Or to " secure the state against gross political misdemeanors ... " Or according to a US Congressional Report , " to protect the integrity of American political institutions . " <p> What the senators are called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which they receive on Election Day . The bluntest statement of this idea was that of the Republican Sen. William Giles of Virginia , as described by John Quincy Adams : <p> " Impeachment was not a criminal prosecution ; it was no prosecution at all . The Senate sitting for the trial of impeachment was not a court , and ought to discard and reject all process of analogy to a court of justice . A trial and removal of a judge upon impeachment need not imply any criminality or corruption in him . Congress had no power over the person but only over the office . And a removal by impeachment was nothing more than a declaration by Congress to this effect : You hold dangerous opinions , and if you are suffered to carry them into effect you will work the destruction of the nation . We want your offices for the purpose of giving them to men who will fill them better . " ( Vignettes , Ibid. , Page 285 ) . <p> Political , legal process <p> Hence the confusing and vague expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that the Senate makes a political decision . <p> The down-to-earth parlance is that the voting in the Senate is just a " numbers game , " or will go " along partisan political lines . " <p> Nevertheless , it is also said that the high two-thirds voting requirement for conviction is intended to safeguard a respondent from purely partisan votes . <p> We will mention the term " political question " which sometimes crops up in connection with impeachment . It is said to be one which the Constitution left to the sound discretion of the legislature , over which the courts have no jurisdiction . They are questions of policy , or concerned with the wisdom , not with the legality , of a particular act or measure , to be decided by the people in their sovereign capacity , or in regard to which full discretionary authority has been delegated to the legislative or executive branches . <p> Whenever impeachment proceedings are questioned before the Supreme Court on certiorari , the proponents raise the argument that the matter of impeachment is a political question that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government , Congress . But the Supreme Court has maintained that when a right is involved , this is a justiciable matter which falls under its expanded certiorari jurisdiction . <p> ( Cesar T.

Based on their annual report , visitors in Davao City reached 700,000 in 2011 from the last year 's 670,000 . The bulk of the tourists are domestic travelers while among the foreign markets came from the United States , Japan and Korea . <p> He adds that the mushrooming of new hotels in Davao City is an indication of an active economy . <p> Comparing from 2000 , tourist arrivals have increased to about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domestic promotions and cheaper air fare . <p> Part of the efforts of Davao to boost tourism is by coming up with an adventure race to showcase Mt .

The 24-hour race-to-the-peak challenge aims to promote Davao region as a leading destination for eco-adventure tourism . <p> The extreme sport challenge , slated on April 28-29 , will be a major highlight of the annual " Pista sa Kinaiyahan " ( Feast for the Environment ) celebration of Sta . Cruz . <p> Boncato says the Boulder Challenge has made Davao Region , where a major portion of Mt . Apo is located , the leading destination for eco-adventure tourism .

The convention aims to gather all airport authorities , airline companies and CEOs in order to draw up plans and to fast-track linkages with Brunei Darussalam , Indonesia , Malaysia , Philippines-East Asean Growth Area . Boncato said some 200 CEOs are expected to participate in the conference . <p> Boncato points out that showcasing Mt . Apo as a destination for adventure races also opens new doors for destinations surrounding it . The tourists of Davao City are also offered to go beyond . Vacationers could also visit Samal Island which is in Davao del Norte , and also Sta . Cruz in Davao del Sur . <p> " Last year 's tourist arrival in Sta .

And that book 's " alterna-history " account of Honest Abe as part-politician and part-vampire slayer comes to vivid life with the movie adaptation to be released worldwide by 20th Century Fox this July ( July 4 in the Philippines ) . <p> Abraham Lincoln : Vampire Hunter is not just highly anticipated by the 2010 novel 's huge readership ; it is likewise a hot celluloid commodity as it is the latest from Kazakhstan-born filmmaker Timur Bekmambetov , whose flair for cinematic mayhem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other published work : Russia 's Night Watch and Day Watch , and his Hollywood debut , Wanted . <p> On hand are director Tim Burton as co-producer/co-financier , Grahame-Smith himself as scriptwriter ( he likewise penned Burton 's recent Dark Shadows ) and Julliard-trained Benjamin Walker ( coincidentally Meryl Streep 's son in law ) and English star Rufus Sewell as the film 's lead protagonist and lead antagonist , respectively . <p> Bekmambetov , Grahame-Smith , Walker and Sewell recently sat together for a brief live chat via Livestream , fielding a selection of questions from RAPPLER and other media outlets in line with their work on Abraham Lincoln : Vampire Hunter . Amid their lively discussion , one can discern the team 's enjoyment at having made the movie and their own anticipation at the world 's reaction to it . <p> What drove Grahame-Smith to come up with his Vampire Hunter book in the first place ? <p> " I was on tour for Pride and Prejudice and Zombies ( his first ' mash-up ' novel ) and everywhere I went , there would a book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At first I thought it was some ( cosmic ) joke until I realized that it might be good to put Lincoln and vampire lore together . " <p> Still , why Lincoln ? <p> The author says that Lincoln is far more embedded in the American psyche than , say , George Washington or Benjamin Franklin , and that the President 's era , " a time when the country was tearing itself apart , " was a thematic fit for his revisionist novel . That , and " I think Abraham Lincoln is the first true American superhero . " Walker concurs , noting that Lincoln " was a common man who pulled himself up to become a hero . " <p> Walker , who " had to lose weight , spend months on axe-throwing , wushu and hitting stunt guys with a rubber axe , " relates that " We did a lot of research for this . " He specifically cites his reading of the book Lincoln 's Melancholy , a fascinating study by Joshua Wolf Shenk of how Lincoln dealt with lifelong depression . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " everything within this movie is treated with care and historical accuracy . " <p> For his part , Bekmambetov remembers reading a Russian thriller author 's account of the US Civil War , adding with a proverbial wink that that book holds " secrets that American does n't want to talk about . " He also cites that " America is a country of immigrants and ( the novel 's ) vampires are immigrants . " <p> When asked how much of its source material wound up in the movie , Bekmambetov quips , " 50/50 . " <p> Grahame-Smith confirms that most of his book is in the movie . <p> " Being the author and the screenwriter has its advantages , " he says . " For me , it was a huge learning experience .

But overall , the film is true to the spirit of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new darling , " as Walker puts it , with the addition of Adam , the lead vampire character portrayed by Sewell . The veteran actor himself was surprised to find that his character was not in the book . " I thought , ' Well , that 's a good start , ' " Sewell recalls . " He 's a counterpart to Lincoln . He sees himself as the ' president ' of the vampires . He 's named Adam because he was the original vampire and was already around at the time of the ancients and the pyramids . He represents the heart of the threat that has to be dealt with . " <p> " Adam is elegant but vicious , " Grahame-Smith points out , " a gentleman like Rhett Butler , and Rufus makes him sympathetic .

Benjamin Walker towers as Abraham Lincoln <p> Tim B. &amp; Timur B. <p> Grahame-Smith credits producer Tim Burton for giving " us the protection " to make this movie on its creators ' terms and for giving a very important tip : " He said , ' Never make a joke of the concept .

' He was very supportive and his role in making this movie is huge , " states Bekmambetov , who also co-produced . Walker attests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " on how to pull the movie off . <p> Walker cites that Bekmambetov has an " extraordinary visual style , " which the soft-spoken director draws from a liking of kung fu movies and his worldly wise view that " action is an extension of the drama . " <p> The filmmaker notes that it was " challenging " to have shot Vampire Hunter in 3D. " ( 3D ) is a unique visual language , " he says . " For example , in the fight scenes , the audience has to feel the distance between them and the ax . " <p> " I ca n't wait to see all this in 3D , " Grahame-Smith says . <p> PRESIDENT BY DAY , VAMPIRE hunter by night . The movie comes to Philippine theaters on July 4 . <p> Who 'd win ? <p> As the chat wound down , the foursome indulged in a few lighthearted queries . <p> Grahame-Smith -- who despite his very hectic life , tries " to write every day , to keep the pipes running so they wo n't get rusty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to manage than a vampire one .

@@970231 <p> When I saw the Bayo advertisement " 50% Australian , 50% Filipino , " I did n't see anything racist or bigoted about it . I thought it was just a statement of fact about the racial mix of the beautiful Filipino-looking model . <p> I have since read the fine print , the line about the " mixing and matching of different nationalities with Filipino blood " as a " sure formula " for " making it in the world arena . " Critics say it is self-denigrating -- and indeed it does read that way -- but I thought the rest of the ad actually said the opposite . To use jargon , it was " triumphalist " about " Filipino heritage as something to be proud of , " as it was the dose of Filipino blood that improved the genetic cocktail and not the other way around . <p> Bayo has since withdrawn the confusing ad . Some say we are too finicky about racial identity , but we are not alone . In Massachusetts today , there rages a debate about whether a senatorial candidate is " 1/32 Cherokee . " <p> ADVERTISEMENT <p> Massachusetts Democrats have chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Harvard Law School who recently held a top post in the Obama administration to protect consumers and regulate the banks . In the heat of the campaign , it was learned that she had earlier claimed to have a Cherokee great-great-grandparent . She had no documents to prove it but cited " family lore " handed down to her by her parents . She is white , blond and blue-eyed . <p> Three things are relevant to the Pinoy debate . One , apparently for the Cherokee nation , 1/32 Cherokee lineage is good enough . The proud Cherokees distill identity not just by blood but by other more reliable bonds of affinity . By comparison , Bayo 's 50-percent Filipino standard is in fact too high . <p> Two , Warren 's opponents suggest that , because of that supposed Indian lineage , she received preferential treatment in school and job applications . This has been denied by the two Ivy League schools where she taught law -- Pennsylvania and Harvard ( itself a feat for a janitor 's daughter ) . But what is significant here is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on " self-identification " -- that is to say , merely on the person 's say-so without using birth certificates and family trees . <p> Three , due to " affirmative action " or what we locally call " social justice , " being Native American is an advantage , while being Filipino is more typically a disadvantage . I recall an actress abroad who diluted her Filipino-ness by describing herself as " mixed Spanish , Chinese , Mexican , Pacific Islander , Malay , Filipino , " as if hoping that people would be too tired to read by the time they get to the Filipino part of her hyphenated identity . <p> Maybe that is why we 're sensitive about our identity . We who embrace Filipino identity pay a price for it and guard it dearly against those who would cheapen or debase it . Three recent debates are telling . <p> The first was the flap over the Azkals , the winning soccer team powered by mixed-blood Filipinos . The name alone speaks volumes . It derives from " asong kalye " -- stray mongrel dogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , accused of verbally sexually harassing a female sports official , explained that it was simply a misunderstanding . A leading TV commentator condemned him , saying that to be truly Filipino , a diluted bloodline is not enough and one must know our values by heart . There was an Internet backlash from Filipinos based abroad , including those of mixed blood . <p> The second was from the valedictory lecture of a University of the Philippines professor who exhorted her students to remain in the Philippines to serve the country . Overseas Filipino workers protested : We left home only because we had to . We continue to serve the homeland wherever we go . Being Filipino is not about physically being in the Philippines and more about supporting the Philippine economy wherever we may be . <p> The third was about FHM , a glossy men 's magazine , whose cover featured a well-lit , light-skinned model surrounded by darker-hued models in black bikinis , with the tagline " Stepping Out Of The Shadows . " Protesters considered this both racy and racist and , just like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its cover . This episode exposes the internal hierarchy of Filipinos among themselves that fixes the pecking order according to skin pigmentation , with a traditional preference for the light-skinned . <p> The one lesson I learn is that being Filipino is in the heart . A seaman may live 10 , 20 , 30 years abroad and spend just a few months each year in the old country , but he lives and breathes dreams for this country . It is as if physically he 's abroad but deep within he could very well be walking with his kids at SM North . Spiritually he never left home . <p> Migrants might acquire permanent residency or even citizenship elsewhere , but today we have adopted laws for dual citizenship and for overseas voting precisely because we pierce the fictions of law , recognize the practical realities of survival , and offer Filipinos abroad the place of honor they have earned in the homeland . <p> We have come full circle . " The Philippines " began as an idea , a legal construct that brought the islands together under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Upon independence , we adopted the legal test of citizenship and relied on birth and formal indicia of allegiance . Today we recognize it once more as an idea , disengage Filipino-ness from geography , skin color or bloodline , and affirm as true Filipinos only those who dream for this country and its people and are ready to pay the price for it .

Rappler comes from the root words " rap " ( to discuss ) + " ripple " ( to make waves ) . <h> How does WESM work and affect electric bills ? <p> SPOT TRADING . Higher electricity bills await despite the promise of cheaper power through WESM . ( Screengrab from a WESM report . ) <p> MANILA , Philippines -- Consumers who look forward to the rainy season for lower electricity rates will be disappointed as a confluence of factors trigger a peak in prices . <p> Among these factors -- which include supply and demand issues , maintenance shutdown of power plants , seasonal changes , and persisting pricing problems in the spot market -- the latter has been the most peculiar of late . <p> The supply of power is meant to increase over time , creating competition that results in a lower price . Decreasing the price of power that consumers pay for in Luzon and Visayas is the sole goal of the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market or WESM . <p> The WESM failed to deliver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from power generators spiked beyond logic . These spikes have and will burden consumers through higher power rates . <p> Price spikes <p> In July , electricity bills will inch up to , among others , reflect the higher cost of power that retailers , like Manila Electric Co . ( Meralco ) , have bought from WESM a month ago . <p> For four days -- from June 20 to 23 -- power bought from WESM over a time period during the day spiked to a record high of between P45 and over P46 per kilowatt-hour ( kwh ) . These prices between noon to 11 p.m. were abnormally higher than the entire day average of P18 to P24 per kwh during those days . <p> Particularly strange was June 23 , a Saturday . Weekends usually have cheaper prices as demand is low . Spot prices that day still hit over P46 per kwh . <p> These prices reflected either an overall low supply generated by the power plants or high demand from customers . WESM said demand then peaked at 8,796 megawatts ( mw ) but supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Grid Corporation of the Philippines ( NGCP ) was prompted to declare " yellow " or " red " alerts , which warranted the scheduling of rotating brownouts . <p> Red alert is handed out when the contingency reserve is zero or worse , the generation supply is deficient . The yellow alert signifies that the total reserves are less than the capacity of the largest plant , which supplies the power . <p> No brownouts came as demand reportedly stabilized the following days . <p> This was not the first time WESM prices spiked and threats of brownouts loomed . A similar dire spot market situation occurred in January to February 2010 -- the months leading to a national election . <p> Those troubled months were considered a period with the " perfect storm . " Supply was tight largely due to the El Nino phenomenon , scarce fuel supply and simultaneous maintenance shutdowns of key power plants as demand surged with the preparations for the elections coming in full swing . <p> WESM itself noted that February 2010 energy situation showed that the level of prices was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The counterintuitive level of offered prices should be probed , explained , and understood for regulatory and policy development . " <p> How WESM works <p> If prices are settled in the spot market , how can consumers be assured that tightness is not manipulated ? The answer is simple : they ca n't . <p> A monthly assessment report by the PEMC of the spot market situation in January to February 2010 , when contingency reserve was similarly tight , showed that the market still needs additional oversight powers to avoid pricing errors . <p> More market re-runs are needed before settling on a price . In short , the WESM needs to transact business instantaneously and in real-time . <p> WESM was created following the restructuring of the energy sector under Electric Power Industry Reform Act ( EPIRA ) of 2001 . WESM is where power suppliers disclose energy outputs and agree on energy prices . The Philippine Electricity Market Corporation ( PEMC ) facilitates the trading at WESM . <p> Currently , the trading process at WESM works like this : <p> Stakeholders determine the total demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " happens . Seeing the demand , the suppliers submit bids , essentially telling PEMC they are willing to supply , for example , 100 megawatts at P10 per megawatt . <p> PEMC ranks the bids from the lowest to the most expensive , until it has enough supply bids to meet the total demand for power . <p> The highest priced offer that is accepted becomes the spot market 's price for the hour . <p> Electricity is thrown to the grid and facilitated by the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines ( NGCP ) . <p> Then it is distributed to households and businesses through distribution companies like Meralco . <p> Trading goes on an hourly basis , depending on demands from households , manufacturers , office buildings , and other consumers . The numbers vary , change , increase or decrease . <p> WESM has monitoring devices called MAG Marketing Monitoring Indices . These devices " suggest the presence of market power and other behaviors that could undermine market efficiency . " <p> The MAG Marketing Monitoring Indices include the following : <p> The Price Setting Frequency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participant sets the price in a specific period . If a participant 's price became the last accepted offer , they have more opportunities to design bidding strategies that influence prices , says WESM . <p> The Pivotal Supplier Index ( PSI ) studies whether the demand can be supplied without a particular generator . Pivotal suppliers are watched because they can influence the pricing scheme . <p> The Combined PSFI-PSI Index ( CPPI ) counts the number of intervals a participant is both a price setter and a pivotal player . <p> These indeces , however , are not definitive tests to measure excessive market power , or even if such market power was misused . <p> Notes from the WESM market analysis show that in most instances , pivotal players and price setters are those from coal-fired plants in 2010 , followed by natural gas plants . They have yet to determine if these happened in the same trading hours . <p> Malampaya shutdown <p> At the heart of the pricing issue at WESM is tight supply . This will manifest again this July as the Malampaya Natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will go on an 8-day maintenance shutdown from July 13 to 21 . <p> The Philippines has a total installed generating capacity of 15,610 megawatt ( mw ) as of 2012 . With a dependable capacity of only 13,319 mw overall , the maintenance shutdown of Malampaya will further reduce the thin emergency buffer supply of only a little over 2,000 mw . <p> Malampaya provides fuel to power plants that supply 40% to 45% of the needs of Luzon . These gas-fired facilities can generate 2,700 mw . <p> The shutdown will greatly affect Luzon 's power supply situation for the month -- and yes , the loss will affect prices . <p> With the temporary shutdown , the power plants that depend on Malampaya will have to use alternate , and more expensive , fuel just to make sure that there is enough power in the system . <p> Other power plants will also have to offer their maximum available capacity . This entails working the machines at full power and most of the time , using emergency reserves that run on more expensive fuel , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of plants or outage is one of the many reasons for the deterioration of the reserves , " a WESM market report states . <p> Maintenance shutdowns <p> Power plants constantly halt operations to conduct an overall inspection . Parts are changed , cleaned , and prepared for another long haul . <p> But in the Philippines , the limited supply has required shutdowns to be scheduled with the energy department to ensure that other plants can throw in additional power to the grid . <p> The NGCP monitors the supply-demand condition in the grid , allots a contingency reserve and , if needed , issues alerts . <p> These alerts are usually issued -- and rotating blackouts occur -- when plants shutdown not because they are scheduled for maintenance but because of sudden technical problems . <p> Competitive market <p> Once Malampaya goes online by July 21 , energy supplies are expected to stabilize . But consumers should anticipate increase in their electric bills in the August billings . <p> Fortunately , as this is a La Ni ? a year , there are no threats to low water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the contingency reserves reach alarming levels . <p> Optimistically , power prices will lower with the return of the natural gas facility by end of July . <p> But this is discounting two key elements that will result in lower power price : the need for additional supply and more diverse energy sources . <p> Visayas , for example , is highly dependent on geothermal sources . The lesson of the Mindanao power supply woes highlight the impact of El Ni ? o since the region is largely reliant on hydro sources . <p> When WESM prices jacked up in June 2012 and February 2010 , tapping the plants using expensive imported fuel or oil also jacked up prices . <p> Unless generating capacities are built today , there will be power supply problems in the future . <p> Additional power plants , power players , and a diverse supply chain will push for a more competitive market that will put WESM into good use -- it will lower down electricity prices . - Rappler.com <h> Would you like to share your vote ? <p> Welcome to Rappler , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digitally fuelled actions for social change .

@@1026237 <p> Following the adage " a picture is worth a thousand words , " a collage of statistics , graphs and sentences that highlights the key points is presented in this article to challenge the reader 's impressions of the Philippine economy . This historical macroeconomic perspective can lead to an understanding of why the Philippines is performing the way it does today . <p> In terms of economic size , as measured by gross domestic product ( GDP ) , data from the late economic historian Angus Maddison show that the Philippines ranked third after Japan in 1950 ( Table 1 ) , but Japan was not the largest economy in East Asia either . When official statistics first appeared in 1950 , the Philippines emerged second to Japan only because data for the other " economies " in East Asia had yet to be collected . <p> The Maddison data also show that the largest economy in the region in 1950 was that of China , followed by Japan and Indonesia . The Philippines ranked fourth . ( Table 1 ) <p> ADVERTISEMENT <p> In terms of GDP per capita , Table 2 indicates that the Philippines ranked fifth and Japan third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kong and Malaysia were already more affluent on average than the Philippines in 1950 . In fact , the Maddison data reveal ( not shown in table ) that Taiwan became more affluent than the Philippines in 1965 . South Korea accomplished the same thing in 1968 . <p> Period of industrialization <p> A defining feature of the economic development of both the advanced and newly industrialized countries is a period of sustained industrialization -- that is , an increasing share of industry output to total economic output and of industry employment to total employment . It did not matter if import substitution was pursued first then export-oriented afterward or vice versa , or a combination . What mattered at least for the East Asian successful economies was that industrialization was pursued in a strategic way . The goal was to attain domestic economic progress and internal strength in order to overcome external threats and vulnerability . <p> From 1946 to 1984 , the Philippine economy experienced a period of steady industrialization , albeit it was not the strategic type . Since the mid-1980s , the Philippine economy has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Figure 1 ) . Another sign that deindustrialization has been occurring is the declining share of the industry sector to total employment ( shown as the black area in Figure 2 ) . Notice also the declining employment share of agriculture and the rising share of the service sector . ( Figures 1 and 2 ) <p> The consequence of deindustrialization is that the service sector has become the dominant sector in the Philippine economy . Now , agriculture and industry play the supporting roles rather than the leading roles . <p> Thus , the Philippine experience -- becoming a service sector-led economy without undergoing real industrialization -- deviates from the typical pattern that characterizes economic advancement . It is a problematic pattern because the service sector can not generate sufficient economic surplus to back up an industrialization program . It can not generate enough jobs to absorb the large army of unemployed Filipinos who have different skill levels and educational attainment . Moreover , it can not on its own push the large number of poor Filipinos out of poverty . Ultimately , a service sector-led economy is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a robust economic expansion that is sustained over decades . <p> Deindustrialization <p> Deindustrialization also coincided with the fall in investments in the domestic economy especially since the 1980s . Figure 3 shows that the GDP share of capital formation in 2010 was comparable to that in 1986 -- the figures for the recent decade were generally lower compared with figures in the earlier periods . All things being the same , falling domestic investments over an extended period hollowed out the economy . <p> The " remedy " to the problem came in the form of a systematic deregulation and liberalization program that was implemented from about the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s . Of course , it had to be done , but in some ways deregulation and liberalization contributed to the further hollowing out of the economy . The irony of the situation is that the weakened domestic economic base can not reap large gains from economic openness .

In this regard , the Philippine economy is not anymore the " sick man " of Asia . The " recovery " would have been earlier ( in 1997 ) if not for the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis . What is more significant is that the two-decade struggle is equivalent to losing a generation worth of economic progress . ( Figures 4 and 5 ) <p> The Philippines has graduated from a " boom-and-bust " cycle of economic performance . <p> Modern economies undergo a form of " boom-and-bust " cycle . The character of the cycle for the Philippines is shown in Figure 6 .

That is , each government loses ground in pushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pattern in Figure 6 is consistent with the end-is-near psychology that produces the attitude that there is not much that can be done in the remaining period .

Every initiative -- individual , private enterprise ( local and foreign investors ) , and public sector -- must be geared toward the goal of rebuilding the economy even as each pursues one 's self-interest . It is a challenging project given the present configuration of the economy . The crucial element in such a pursuit is a vision of a Philippines that Filipinos wish to achieve as a people .

@@1250234 <p> The proposed legislation seeking to impose higher excise taxes on liquor and tobacco products , more popularly known as the sin tax bill , is one of the most controversial pieces of legislation that ever crossed the halls of Congress . <p> One of the main issues is whether the sin tax law should apply a unitary rate on alcohol and cigarette products , regardless of their retail price . <p> Let us assume , for example , that the unitary rate is P10 and the cheapest cigarette or alcohol brand costs P1 while the premium brand costs P10 . Since the rate is unitary , both classes will be subjected to the P10 unitary rate . <p> ADVERTISEMENT <p> In practical terms , the unitary rate means that the poor man ( who will cater to the cheaper brand ) will have to pay P11 , 91 percent of which is excise tax , while the rich man ( who will cater to the expensive brand ) will pay P20 , only 50 percent of which is excise tax . <p> In tax parlance , although the absolute value of tax collected is the same , there is a higher burden of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the higher percentage of tax relative to their ability to pay . <p> Some constitutional considerations <p> Definitely , the government has laudable objectives behind the proposed tax legislation , but given the vigorous opposition to the tax measure , the debate will not likely end up in Congress but in the halls of the Supreme Court . <p> On its face , the tax measure , in its current form , appears to have discriminatory effect against the poor who will bear the larger tax burden . It appears regressive in nature , and seeks to impose higher burden on those who are in the lower brackets of economic class and status . <p> As far as I can recall from my law school days , one of the principles of a sound tax system , based on Adam Smith 's Canons of Taxation , is " theoretical justice , " which means that the tax system " should be fair to the average taxpayer and based upon his ability to pay . " ( Vitug &amp; Acosta , Tax Law and Jurisprudence , 2006 ) <p> Our Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provides in Article VI , Section 28 , par . ( 1 ) that : " the rule of taxation shall be uniform and equitable . The Congress shall evolve a progressive system of taxation . " <p> Is it equitable to require the underprivileged to pay the same amount of tax as the rich ? Is the proposed tax measure really germane to its regulatory objective when the wealthy and their children can continue smoking even with the higher tax rate ? Is this not really discriminating against those belonging to the lower-income bracket of the population ? Is it not unfair , unjust or oppressive to pass a tax measure that will kill or , at the very least , substantially put at a disadvantage the local tobacco industry , which has been part of the national patrimony since time immemorial ? <p> Is the proposed tax legislation consistent with our Constitution 's " Declaration of Principles and State Policies " to " promote comprehensive rural development " and " develop a self-reliant and independent national economy " ? Will it violate the constitutional directive that " all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develop " ? Will it run against the constitutional objective to have an " expanding productivity as the key to raising the quality of life for all , especially the underprivileged " ? <p> Indeed , in Central Bank Employees Association v. BSP ( G.R. No. 148208 , 15 December 2004 ) , the Supreme Court said , " If the challenge to the statute is premised on the denial of a fundamental right , or perpetuation of prejudice against persons favored by the Constitution with special protection , judicial scrutiny ought to be more strict . " <p> Otherwise stated , statutes that discriminate or disadvantage those of lower economic class and status ( like the poor ) would be met with strict scrutiny by the courts . <p> And , when the strict scrutiny test is applied , the challenged measure " is presumed unconstitutional , and the burden is upon the government to prove 1 that the classification is necessary to achieve a compelling state interest , and 2 that it is the least restrictive means to protect such interest . " ( Serrano v. Gallant Maritime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> Or is the nature of the tax as an excise tax and the regulatory objective of the tax measure ( i.e. , protect and promote public health ) as well as the safeguards that are being contemplated ( e.g. , 6 Billion Peso subsidy to the tobacco industry ) sufficient to make it hurdle constitutional scrutiny ? <p> Whatever it is , I fervently hope that our legislators will act with constitutional prudence and circumspection before finally passing the proposed tax measure into law , lest their gallant efforts to put it in place after all these years will be for naught . <p> ( The author is the co-managing partner and head of the corporate and special projects department of ACCRALAW and a law professor at the Ateneo Law School .
