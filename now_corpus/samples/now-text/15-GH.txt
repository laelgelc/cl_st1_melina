@@1902231 <p> CAF 's Player of the Year prize has , in some years , produced unpopular , unworthy winners . Could it be due to all the many strings attached to the process ? <p> COMMENTSammie Frimpong <p> As sure as the Confederation of African Football ( CAF ) names a Player of the Year for the continent every twelve months , the credibility of that choice is certain to be disputed by some . <p> 2014 proved no different . Three nights ago in Lagos , Ivorian captain Yaya Toure got crowned Africa 's finest for a fourth successive year . Truly , many rooted - and voted - for the 31-year-old , yet there remain some who feel the Manchester City man was n't really the best fit . Take , for instance , Ghana forward Asamoah Gyan who has expressed gross displeasure over being ignored again for a trophy he felt was genuinely his . <p> " I think the fans and everybody on the continent know what I did in 2014 , " the former Sunderland forward told Ghanasoccernet.com . <p> " I think in 2014 I deserved the award . " <p> Gyan might be the latest victim of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't the first - the likes of Mohamed Aboutrika , Samuel Osei Kufuor , Didier Drogba , and Austin Okocha have all been left gutted in the past - and hardly would he be the last . <p> CAF might provide the excuse that its annual Player of the Year is decided strictly by vote . And , yes , it does appear so . But there is more to it than just that . The voting pattern , released on the governing body 's website after a new winner is chosen , does look all legit and easy to figure out with a calculator . The politics behind it , though , is n't nearly as simple . Just study the trend , and the irregularities literally jump at you . <p> Brighter lights , better odds <p> Consider , for starters , the where-you-play factor . Gyan identified it as a probable reason why he , for all he achieved for club and country in 2014 , was n't even deemed worthy of a place among the final three nominees . <p> " What I call it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Europe , " he opines . <p> " I feel like if an African player is doing everything right who deserves an award and he is not playing at a bigger club that means the player is not eligible to win it . That is what I see . " <p> Gyan , of course , is employed at club level by unfashionable Al Ain in unfashionable UAE . There , he picked the domestic championship 's topscorer prize ( for the third season running ) with a whopping tally of goals , topped the 2014 AFC Champions League 's scorers ' charts on a dozen strikes , and was officially hailed as the Best Foreign Player in Asia . Such feats , ideally , ought to have complemented nicely the history-making highlights the ' Baby Jet ' chalked at the 2014 World Cup with Ghana . <p> Wrong . <p> Instead , the former achievements apparently only rendered the latter null and void . Gyan , in pushing his argument , cites Aboutrika , another sufferer of such circumstances . <p> The midfielder was arguably the force behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn of the century ( 2006 , 2008 , and 2010 ) . In two of those years , his consistency and class also propelled his club , Egypt 's Al Ahly , to conquests in the CAF Champions League . Yet Aboutrika missed out on all those occasions , overlooked in favour of his Europe-based peers . As scant consolation , CAF , in 2005 , created the African Inter-Club Player of the Year award - a considerably inferior version of the real thing - just so Aboutrika and his colleagues excelling on the continent would have something to celebrate . Insulting , eh ? <p> While it is commerciably reasonable for CAF to desire that the PoTY winners play for clubs in those Western nations where football 's lights illuminate brightest , that likelihood is n't theirs to will . Quality , not geographic location , should determine who Africa decorates as its best footballer for any given year.Criteria , please ... <p> Trick question , everyone : Exactly what is CAF 's criteria for determining who to nominate for the African Player of the Year award ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and probably nor does CAF President Issa Hayatou himself . If indeed any such standard measuring lines exist , they should be laid bare , as Fifa have regarding the Ballon d'Or . Until then , all are free to declare the CAF PoTY an award ultimately decided by the whims of whoever CAF mandates to draw up its nominees ' lists . And that , needless to say , is no acceptable situation . <p> Parlez-vous Fran ? aise ? <p> Winners of the CAF PoTY since 2000 have all been as undoubtedly talented as they have been undoubtedly Francophone . <p> But there have been some equally , if not more , talented players from English- or Arab-speaking parts of Africa who could have been coronated as well ; refer to the outset of this article for some of the best known examples . <p> The reason why these never got rewarded with African football 's most coveted individual honour is perhaps thoroughly explained by the latest voting pattern.At a glance , no trend is obvious . Take it apart , though , and nothing could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French as a widely spoken language had their votes swaying towards one of the two Francophone candidates Toure and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang , but mostly in favour of the eventual winner . And not just any number of points , but the most ( 5 , with only Burundi opting to give 4 as its highest ) on offer for a single vote . Any surprise , then , that the duo finished winner and first runner-up respectively ? <p> Charity begins at home <p> There is another bias , however , that nearly all five 2014 CAF PoTY finalists benefited immensely from . It 's easier to discern , really . Gyan ( Ghana ) , Toure ( Cote d'Ivoire ) , and Aubameyang ( Gabon ) received the maximum points from their respective nations . Nigeria had two to pick from , with CSKA Moscow 's Ahmed Musa emerging the favored of the pair with top marks . The other , goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama , had just a point less . <p> Enough said . <p> Other instances <p> For 2007 , Didier Drogba was CAF 's shoo-in choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , but being on international duty ( namely , a crunch 2008 Nations Cup quarter-final in Ghana ) prevented him from turning up to collect what was due him . In CAF 's opinion , Drogba had , in effect , forfeited the award , and promptly handed it to the next best , Malian Kanoute . Nothing could have spelt politics in bolder type . <p> Two years later , Drogba did claim it - after he had resolved his differences with CAF - when he was n't even the bookies ' favorite . What ought to have rightfully belonged to four-time winner Eto'o , who had starred as Pep Guardiola 's Barcelona romped to an unprecedented Spanish treble , appeared to have been given to Drogba out of sympathy for his own earlier unfair loss . Maybe not , but it definitely did seem so . <p> Righting the wrongs <p> For a fact , CAF 's African Player of the Year award could never be completely rid of such messy strings as have been identified above . Indeed , no scheme recognizing individual brilliance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ballon d'Or , as explained by Goal 's Carlo Garganese sometime this week - could be wholly controversy-free . Still , CAF could take some steps to bring the award 's outcome more in line with common sense and fairness . <p> Regulations prohibiting coaches/technical directors from voting for footballers they handle at international level - and even Fifa could take a cue here , as Garganese explained - would n't be a bad start . And , going further , perhaps professionals who view the game from a slightly different angle than the coach 's largely technical perspective could be allowed to have their say as well in the final analysis . The opinions of journalists , for one , usually reflects the thinking of the masses and could be harnessed to good effect . <p> How good , though ? <p> Well , a reduced margin for error , lesser gimmicks , and a wider/richer pool of ' king-makers ' to tap from in ensuring CAF 's future Player of the Year winners would be infinitely more popular and better received across board than they 'd ever been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

They want to give training after school in the school facilities . It 's a different system but it will give 2.2 million kids from the ages of 6 to 11 training three times a week . That will help football grow here . " <p> The Wanda Project , initiated in 2012 , sponsors children to live and train in Spain with professional clubs Atletico Madrid , Valencia and Villarreal . Ten children join each club every year and remain for three years . <p> " Eighty per cent of the China under-19 squad play in Europe already , " says Davidsen . " No matter if they 're successful in Europe , they will come back to China with a different philosophy and a better football education . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling their top players to Europe but China sends their youth out to take their education in Europe . " <p> With long-term planning now a priority for the CFA , and a thriving , well financed domestic scene , there are few reasons why China can not go on to make an impact on the world game . Good showings at future tournaments might not be greeted with such surprise . The secret of China 's success is well and truly out .

@@1904238 <p> COMMENT : The coach is on the brink of the sack following Tuesday 's defeat -- but those above him are to blame for the Rossoneri 's crisis <p> By Carlo Garganese <p> First it was Max Allegri 's fault . Then it was Clarence Seedorf 's . And now , according to those in power , AC Milan 's never-ending crisis is all down to Pippo Inzaghi . <p> After just seven months in charge , the Rossoneri coach could now be sacked following Tuesday 's Coppa Italia quarter-final defeat to Lazio . Statistically , the striking legend can have no complaints if he gets the chop . Milan are in the bottom half of Serie A , with qualification to next season 's Europa League -- let alone the Champions League - already a distant dream . They have won just six of their 20 league games and have begun 2015 with one point from four matches -- their worst start to a New Year in 74 years . <p> Clearly , changes need to be made at Via Turati . But the scapegoating and sacking of Inzaghi - just like Allegri and Seedorf before him - is not the solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and CEO Adriano Galliani are the real cause of Milan 's problems . <p> The duo masterminded the most glorious period in Milan 's history after Berlusconi bought the club in 1986 . Under revolutionary coach Arrigo Sacchi , they constructed arguably the greatest club team ever -- starring the likes of Marco van Basten , Ruud Gullit , Frank Rijkaard , Franco Baresi and Paolo Maldini -- and romped to successive European Cups . Numerous Ballon d'Or winners and trophies were added over the ensuing two decades as Milan proudly became ' Il club piu titolato al mondo ' -- the squad with the most trophies in history . <p> But since their last Champions League success in 2007 -- when an ageing group of greats featuring Maldini , Alessandro Nesta , Rino Gattuso , Clarence Seedorf and Inzaghi himself had one final hurrah on the biggest stage -- Milan have steadily declined on and off the pitch . The 2011 Scudetto triumph could not mask the fact that the Rossoneri were set to implode both sportingly and financially . <p> While there are many reasons for the depressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A , the effects of the Calciopoli scandal and other economic factors related to Berlusconi 's career as a politician and entrepreneur -- the president and his loyal right-hand man Galliani must take responsibility for running the organisation into the ground in recent years . <p> The club 's transfer policy has been horrendous , with the list of players signed since 2007 full of rejects , free transfers and high-profile veterans well past their sell-by date . Fernando Torres , Michael Essien , Valter Birsa , Cristian Zaccardo , Nicola Legrottaglie , Emerson , Mancini , the second coming of Kaka and Andriy Shevchenko -- the roll of stale arrivals goes on and on . <p> There has been no medium or long-term vision from Galliani , no evidence of a progressive project . Worst of all , a host of talented youngsters have been released prematurely -- including Borussia Dortmund pair Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Sokratis Papastathopoulos , and Italy internationals Matteo Darmian and Davide Astori . <p> Money has been squandered on sub-par performers . In 2013 , Galliani farcically handed Juventus ? 12 million for Alessandro Matri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Matri registered just once before he was shipped out to Fiorentina the following January , while the Argentine has scored 40 goals in 74 games . It was not the first time Galliani directly aided Juve -- his senseless decision to allow Andrea Pirlo to leave on a free transfer in 2011 was key to the Bianconeri 's rebirth . This has all resulted in the sub-standard Milan squad we see today . <p> Admittedly , the budget available to Galliani since the mid-noughties has been limited . Berlusconi has been unable and unwilling to invest as he once did -- and for a team that is second only to Real Madrid in Champions League trophies , this is not acceptable . If Berlusconi is unable to provide the funds required for a big club , then he must either find a partner with means , or sell up . His determination to hold on to power while providing little in return is an insult to fans and , like Arsene Wenger at Arsenal , past glories do n't make him or Galliani immune from accountability . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never seen Milan being run in a less serious manner than it is now , " former midfielder Zvonimir Boban fumed last year . <p> At the age of 78 and 70 respectively , Berlusconi and Galliani are out of touch with modern football . Milan used to be one of the most innovative clubs in the world -- Jean Pierre Meersseman 's scientifically ground-breaking Milan Lab prolonging the careers of Paolo Maldini and Alessandro Costacurta into their 40s . Now Milan are trailing in the wake of a new order of modernisers , and this has had a huge impact economically . <p> Milan were one of only two clubs in the 2015 Deloitte Money League ( the other being Inter ) to see their revenue from 2013-14 decrease from the previous season . They posted losses of ? 13.8m and dropped out of the top 10 of the world 's richest clubs for the first time ever . Their matchday revenue at San Siro for last season was just ? 24.9m -- Real Madrid , Barcelona , Manchester United and Arsenal all surpassed the ? 100m mark . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Europe 's top clubs and what is particularly holding them back is their facilities and infrastructure , " Deloitte 's Senior Manager Austin Houlihan told Goal . " They have n't got modern , up-to-date facilities from which they can generate significant matchday and commercial revenues . <p> " Juventus have shown what having a new stadium can do and , while their home crowds are comparatively small , the uplift from having moved to their new stadium is a model for Milan and the rest of Italian football . " <p> Milan are set to miss the Champions League for a second successive season , exacerbating the economic misery over the next two years . Things are so desperate that they were forced last week to sell the team bus in order to cut costs . Due to Financial Fair Play , even if Berlusconi was prepared to return to his spending levels of the 80s and 90s , Milan would be unable to generate enough income to compete in the transfer market . <p> With the club in such disarray -- and we have not even mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barbara -- how can the coach possibly be held responsible for the team 's failings on the pitch ? <p> Sacking Inzaghi will solve nothing . Exactly the same fate will befall his replacement , whether it be Mauro Tassotti , Luciano Spalletti or even a Jose Mourinho or Pep Guardiola.

Thirteen newspapers -- The Torchlight , The Informant , Standard Times , Metro , Independent Observer , Prime Time , Democrat , African Youth Voices ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Champion and Nation Business and Finance -- and two radio stations , Radio New Song and Radio Bankasoka , have been fined various sums for breaching provisions in the IMC Code of Practice . <p> The Independent Observer and Torchlight newspapers have been fined twice already this year .

Three other newspapers -- Nation , Exclusive and All-Met Business Journal -- have also been formally warned by the IMC following professional lapses . <p> The situation has prompted Sierra Leonean authorities , including the country 's President , Ernest Bai Koroma ; and Chairman of the IMC , Ambassador Allieu Kanu , to make several appeals to the media , urging professional conduct in reporting . Despite the appeals and sanctions , frequent ethical violations persist . <p> In Cote d'Ivoire , several media organisations and journalists have been sanctioned over unprofessional conduct within the last 15 months . In 2014 alone , eight media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ivorian Press regulatory body , Conseil Natiol de la Presse ( CNP ) for acts of unprofessionalism . The eight newspapers were Notre Voie , Le Jour Plus , Le Temps , Le Nouveau Courrier , Aujourd'hui , Soir Info , Le Quotidien d'Abidjan , and Le Monde d'Abidjan . Moussa Traor ? , Alaf ? Wakili , N'Guessan Kouassi and Oula Saint Claver were the four journalists sanctioned . The sanctions ranged from fines to suspensions and withdrawal of licenses . <p> The MFWA subsequently petitioned the CNP complaining about the severity of the sanctions and the potential for such sanctions to result in self-censorship by the media in the country . At the same time , the MFWA urged the media to be professional and circumspect in their reportage . <p> While there have been many recent cases of unprofessional conduct by many Senegalese journalists , a recent incident of blackmail involving online journalist , Ibrahima Ngom , is worth highlighting .

The minister heeded the call of the media Association but the hearing of the case had already commenced . The court subsequently handed the journalist a six-month suspended prison sentence and granted him clemency due to the withdrawal of the case by the minister , bringing the sentence down to two-months . <p> Unprofessionalism in the Senegalese media prompted the inauguration of a jury of peers in August 2014 , to help promote professional standards .

Already , the Courts in Ghana are imposing what is considered to be punitive fines against the media , which have the potential of crippling or collapsing affected media organisations . <p> " The biggest threat to press freedom in Ghana today is not legislation , or governmental restrictions .

He also organised musical concerts and other events to entertain the Ghanaian community in the UK in general and London in particular . <p> Sammy Kay had a very fruitful relationship with a Caribbean radio station based in London called the WBNK where he was a Presenter for over a decade . He developed the passion for radio and decided to establish his own radio station . <p> Known as the Weekend Black Listeners Station ( WBLS ) , Sammy , as affectionately called aimed at using the station , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diaspora , to play Ghanaian music apparently to boost the operations of his music records shop . <p> The station was also used to announce social events in the Ghanaian community but by and large it was all music station with DJs and Presenters such as ' Okoto ' , Captain Morgan , Kwabena Gyasi , among others playing top Ghanaian music to entertain their audience . <p> The Sunday morning gospel show by Antwi Boasiako was also another hit point that drew much audience .

WBLS was thus the real ' tool ' to reverse the trend . It provided news about and for the people , music they understand because of language and culture and above all the station was used as the medium of public sphere . <p> One of the ideas about Public Sphere is about the situation where individual members of the society such as Ghanaians in London gather in places like the churches , funerals group meeting , and other social centers to deliberate on everyday life issues in civil society . The issues could range from politics , sports , economy and religion depending upon the interest of participating members and this was well done on WBLS , Sammy Kay 's initiative . <p> The station became much more popular when a Sunday afternoon political show known as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' was aired .

The late night show for adults hosted by Nana Dokua was an icing on the cake . <p> Indeed Ghana was brought closer to its nationals in London through the magic of radio made available by Sammy Kay , but all was happening on the weekends and during the early 2000 a morning show was introduced and other programmes during the day followed . <p> WBLS was no longer a weekend radio station but operated for 24 hours .

@@1919238 the Bottom of Global Education <p> The biggest ever global school rankings in the world has recently been published with Asian countries in the top five places , and African countries at the bottom . In this ranking , Ghana found itself at the very last of the pack . In reaction , many high government officials , including the Minister of Education , have raised several doubts about the integrity of this report , questioning its methodology and conclusion . But I was not in the least surprised that Ghana came last , specifically in science and mathematics education . My curiosity is how Ghana would have ranked if the research had focused on the liberal arts as well , namely history , law , linguistics and so on . Would the country have fared any better ? I doubt it . <p> We should begin from the beginning and ask ourselves about the very policies and politics undergirding our educational system itself . And when we ask this question , we can take judicial notice of the fact that the general purpose of education is the modification of the individual 's character and his transposition into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solve societal problems . Then the follow-up question will be : How many of our educated elites are truly good citizens using the education they have acquired to solve any of our national problems ? And if we realize that the answer borders on zilch , our next step is to go back to the first question and examine the very educational policy in the country to find out if its very aims and goals conform to our national policy standards : that of bringing about the citizens ' transformation for the purpose of investing in them the intellectual capacity to solve our national problems . <p> It is a fact that for a very long time , teachers , who hold the keys to our educational development , have been at the receiving end of the national economic collapse . Their salaries have been diminished on account of inflation , their allowances have been cut ; and in some instances , their wages have gone unpaid for several months ........... And these issues facing the profession have resulted in discouraging many more qualified people from joining it . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good alternatives for employment , or who merely use it as a stepping stone for better prospects . Ironically , even the teachers who escape the profession to join politics are prone to forget the plight faced by their colleagues , or to do anything about them . So the space of opportunities available for teachers for their advancement has shrunk over the years , until today , their chances for advancement remain virtually non-existent . Unsurprisingly , the profession has attracted some of the least capable and even morally irresponsible elements . But no teaching force composed of mediocrity or conceived in irresponsibility can modify the character of citizens , let alone endow them with the capacity and intellectual curiosity to solve our societal problems . <p> Couple the foregoing with the radical albeit negative educational reforms carried out in the early eighties , and one can acquire a sharper perspective into Ghana 's educational devolution from one of the best to the very worst . In the early eighties , the PNDC government under J.J. Rawlings , in responding to probable demands from the IMF , slashed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prior to Rawlings ' far reaching educational reforms , a student had to spend a total of seven years in high school , from form one to upper six , before proceeding to the University . And when this radical slash in duration was made , the transformation was quick and immediate . There were some students who initially thought that they had entered secondary school to do at least a five year program , only to wake up one morning to be told that they would qualify to graduate in the following year . Meanwhile , Rawlings and some of these politicians sent their children abroad to escape the educational turmoil they themselves had created in the country . <p> During Kufuor 's era , the three year high school was considered too short , and was therefore extended to four years , if only to bring it to par with the US and international standards . But one of the first actions of the present NDC government was to revert cynically to the three years of high school education . This back and forth within the educational structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was it ever backed by any substantial and material infusion of resources into it . Indeed , any critical observer could interpret these goings on as sheer political gimmick , or even a virtual attempt to abandon any serious attitude toward qualitative education for which the country was well known . Now the cycle is complete since those half-baked products of a harangued system have found themselves into the classroom producing other half-baked scholars . Should it be any surprise then that today , the country has been put at the bottom of the global assessment of the quality of education ? <p> And if we study how we came to this point , the matter should not be surprising to us at all because we are still continuing on the path of irreversible descent . After all , we have Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa as our Minister responsible for Higher Education . This is an individual whose total experience in educational management measures up to the level of his stint as president of the National Union of Ghana Students . In Atta Mills ' time , he stated without compunction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government had constructed over a hundred and twenty schools . He was also very active in promoting the huge payments to Woyome of thousands of dollars in judgment debt . When this whole issue of Ghana 's bottom position came up , he feigned ignorance of the methodology used and asked Ghanaians to wait with him for a proper studies of the report before concluding about our position . Meanwhile there is nothing that has not been explained in this report , and any curious individual with access to a computer can immediately access its methodology and conclusion and certify it as valid . So we have , as our education minister an individual dreaming up educational projects and concocting national debts and feigning ignorance of the methodology of a research that has put us at the bottom . And yet we are surprised that we are at the bottom ? <p> Now any nation involved in any educational uplift will select the best of its citizens with the best of mind and interest to help manage the educational front , because everything else depends on it . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reveal a trend that heavy investment in quality education is directly proportional to human quality , economic development , intellectual creativity and scientific innovation . In short , our whole national development hinges directly on how much seriousness we attach to our educational efforts . And when we do the proper balancing of the equities , we will be the first to acknowledge that our system of education has aptly descended to the bottom of the pack because of our extreme neglect , nonchalance and abuse . <p> But we can tickle ourselves by stating that not enough of African countries were sampled in the research . By this type of posture , we will merely be revealing our own inferiority complex and mediocrity . Are we advocating for a sample that encapsulates more of the worst so that we can be bumped up a little higher in the rankings ? Is that how we can cover our shame ? Such an attitude will not reveal any scientific or mathematical logic , and can only reveal further evidence that we deserve indeed to be at the bottom . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this country 's system as one of the very best in the world . But this kind of assertion was never based in fact since on its face , Ghana 's educational infrastructure is one of the worst in the world . For example , the worst high school in Texas will be far better than any high school in Ghana , if only because such a building will be fully air-conditioned and have a fully equipped library , modern sporting facilities and a computer lab . And how do we propose that we can compete with the worst teaching-learning equipment and come out tops ?

@@1921235 <h> Should Ghana Revert to the Old System of Education ? <p> In the 70s a group in the United States organized an essay competition for Secondary schools in Africa , code-named " Inter-African Annual Essay Competition " . Ghanaian students were always among the top three to be selected . The top three winners were sent to the USA to live with host families for three months . I remember vividly that Stephen Balado Manu , the former MP of Ahafo Ano South , who was then my classmate won the essay competition . I mention this just to illustrate how the old system of education fortified us in the English language , Science and Mathematics . <p> The old system had ten years of both primary and middle levels of education . Those who went to Secondary schools had to pass the common entrance examination to be admitted . After five years in Secondary school , one wrote the General Certificate Examination Ordinary level . Those who did well at that level went on to a two-year Advanced level course ( 6th Form ) that prepared them for the university . Unless you passed the common entrance examination before completing ten years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pre-university education ! ! ! That was a long journey but it was worth it since excellent and matured students were produced . <p> It was , however , a system inherited from the colonial days from a colonial master whose own educational system had changed . There was a need for us to change too . This change was made at the beginning of 1993/94 academic year by the former president , J. J. Rawlings . The new system comprised six years of primary , three years of Junior high and three years of Senior high schools . Training colleges were upgraded to diploma awarding institutions to suit the new change . Preliminary statistics from the government , which became available prior to the introduction of the new system of education , showed that there would be more than 9,300 primary schools , 609,000 students were expected to enrol in about 5400 Junior high schools , and 200,000 students would be enrolled in some 250 Senior high schools . <p> Ever since the new system was introduced , the quality of education , teaching and learning has fallen so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak good English . Personally , I feel the problem emanates from the original mistake of detaching the first three years of Secondary school and joining it to the primary school . What happens is that graduates and specialists who teach the Senior high school students do not come down to teach in the Junior high schools . This phenomenon is a contributory factor to the low performance of students at the Junior high school . <p> These days getting admission to the university is no longer competitive because the ability to pay the fees seems to matter more than the actual grades of the student . This is very common in the private universities that have mushroomed and spread throughout Ghana . Due to pecuniary motives , they admit students with even two passes with the hope that the students would re-sit and pass those subjects they failed and present a good result before they complete their courses at the universities . Those who are not able to make it up are sacked in their final year , dashing all their hopes and the thought of having wasted so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago , Central University had to sack about 350 students during their final year for failing to pass the subjects they failed in High schools . <p> An unfortunate situation and a mass dismissal like this could never have happened in the old system of education where students gained admissions to Universities purely on merit . During those times , all those who had good grades in the Advanced level examination qualified to the Universities . All the names of successful candidates were published in the daily newspapers . The department or faculty accepting a particular student was written against his or her name . Those years , it was common for students coming from village schools to gain admission to Law school , Medical school or school of Administration based solely on their performance at the A Levels . Today your ability to pay determines which department will accept you . University admissions are no longer published in the local newspapers and therefore one examination result can be used by about three students to attend different universities in Ghana . This was never possible in the old system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an alarming level . Gone are the days when Ghanaian students and the old system of education were very effective and comparable globally . Due to the quality of learning at that time and the comparative nature of Ghana 's old system of education to that of Europe and America , students could pass the entrance examinations that could lead them to schools in Europe . Many students could pass the SAT , GRE and GMAT to attend Ivy League Universities in the USA . The craze to go to American and other foreign universities which became known as " Komso " is not so much practiced because the low quality of learning today that can barely match up to the standards abroad . <p> For a country to develop or succeed , more mathematics and science teachers are needed . The world is moving at a very fast and dizzying pace and therefore there is the need to either switch to the old system which is result-oriented , or reduce the number of subjects in the JHS and SHS and concentrate more on science , mathematics and development-oriented subjects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to trail behind in technological development . OECD selected seventy six countries , including Ghana , and the idea was to check which countries have continued to develop in the areas of science and mathematics more especially in their various basic schools . Among the seventy six countries Ghana was last and the worst in science and mathematics ! Can you believe this ? It is now clear that things are no longer the same . To add salt and pepper to the sore of Ghana 's education system , a girl who was adjudged the best student in science and mathematics , was nominated to take part in the International Science and Maths Olympiad that was held in South Africa . At the end of it all , the Ghanaian girl scored zero , throughout . How shameful !

How long can we produce " Facebook " students who complete Universities and do not get jobs ? <p> Both teachers and students are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salaries for more than one year . The Ghana Education Service explains this as error in the system combined with their efforts to remove ghost names . Most teachers are compelled to teach without any passion for the job , thereby giving very little of their efforts to teach the children . The students , on the other hand , are also under pressure due to financial difficulties . Many students can not afford three meals a day . They are unable to pay the hostel rent and are compelled to squat in their friend 's rooms . Such congestion does not promote effective learning . Government actions also account for the pressure on both teachers and students . <p> When Kufuor came to power in 2001 , he saw that students completing Senior High school in three years was not enough to provide full knowledge and a very firm foundation for students preparing to enter Universities and other high schools of learning . He changed the time period for the completion of high school to four years on the advice of the commission set for that purpose . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the NDC came to power and reversed the high school years to three years again ! Why toy with the fate of Ghanaian children ? In case NPP comes to power , will they revert it to four years ? Lord , have mercy ! <p> Dear reader , I am of the firm belief that you will agree with me that radical changes and improvement must be put in place to bring Ghana 's education closer to world standards . For those who passed through the old system will you agree with me that the old system of education must come back ?

They have beds of gold which they never sleep on because they have no sleep anyway , they buy food which they can not eat because they long lost their appetite , we live in sad times . The history of anti-corruption crusaders in Africa is one and the same , their mortality rate in office is very short , before Prof Lumumba director of Kenya 's Anti-Corruption Commission was sent out of office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before his victimization McCarthy in South Africa , and his equivalent in Malawi and Zambia had been victimized . It is high time we as Africans move from the drawing table and go out there and do that which is right and good , to awaken the conscience of Africans so that they may realize that corruption is a cancer that must not be allowed to grow . But I want to use this occasion to remind us Africans , that the children of darkness who are the perpetrators of corruption have one advantage over the children of light , they are well organized , they are prepared to kill , they are prepared to do anything at all to ensure their ill-gotten wealth is retained and protected . I have always said that those who want to fight corruption must go to the bible , and they must go to the book of Mathew and read about a man called John the Baptist , and they must remember he was in the habit of telling a king called Herodias not to engage in the habit of adultery with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often to the irritation of the king , they must also remember that there was a lady called Salome and they must remember that Salome danced so well that Salome asked for John the Baptist head . And I want to remind us Africans , that is the way it is for corruption fighters today , they are like John the Baptist telling the later day Herodias , you are corrupt ! You are corrupt ! The question is , are we prepared ? If we Africans are prepared then I have nothing to fear because this continent will be liberated . The history of oil throughout Africa has been a sad history , if you go to Nigeria which is the 4th or 5th largest producer of oil in Africa , the Nigerians do not have a good story to tell , Nigeria is a great country but is famous for producing some of the greatest thieves the world has ever known , you go to the DR Congo which is the richest resource country in the world and the DR Congo is notable for producing some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angola with all its oil , it has one of the richest women in the world the daughter of the president , Isabella Dos Santos , she claims to be a business woman but the last time I checked , she was just a tenderpreneur . Go to different African countries and the tragedy of Africa is that Africans are in the business of canonizing thieves and demonizing its saints . The question is , you that love this continent , what is it that we must do ? because corruption is alive and well . In Africa all sectors of the economy are not spared from the scourge of corruption , even the church of Christ is not spared , even the mosques are not spared , even the temples are not spared , so do the clergymen present in this country , we have all sinned and fallen short of the glory not only of God but the expectations of the people of Ghana and indeed Africa . The African is a very strange being , when you give the African the power of the vote which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vote ? He waits for some thief to give him 50 cedis or so in exchange for the vote , and then he votes in the direction pointed to him by that thief . I like the way Prof Lumumba puts it ' When an African is given a vote , it 's like he 's been given a blank cheque to go into the showroom and buy for himself a Mercedes Benz , when he gets into the showroom he buys the Tuk Tuk from India and when he gets home he expects the Tuk Tuk to behave like a Mercedes Benz , that has been the tragedy of Africa . When we are given the rare opportunity of the vote , to elect good men and women into public offices , we elect them based on the size or the depth of their pockets , or on the basis of their ethnic extraction and when they occupy the public offices we expect them to behave well . We are asked to elect a committee to determine the fair rules of hunting , then we elect wolves and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheep . We Africans must realize and understand that this is neither the time for sorrows and lamentations nor the time for us to dramatize our pain ; this is the time to re-energize and to warn ourselves of the dangers of corruption . This is an occasion fellow Africans where we must ask ourselves , why it that all civilizations are ahead of us ? <p> In the book of Mathew Jesus told a story about a rich man whom the bible records that one day he went on a long journey . When he was travelling he took 5 talents and gave it to one of his servants , to another he gave 2 talents and to another he gave 1 talent and afterwards left on his journey . On his return the bible records that he called the three servants to come and render accounts , the first servant said ; master you gave me 5 talents and I have worked with it and have 10 , and the master said onto him good and faithful servant , the second servant said ; master you gave me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto him good and faithful servant , the third servant came and said unto him ; master you gave me 1 talent and I knew you were a hard man sowing were you do not reap , take back your talent , and the master said thou wicked and worthless servant , why did n't you give my talent to the exchangers , that I might have usury upon my return , and he commanded the talent to be taken away from him and given to him that had the 10 , and he said ; he who has , more will be given and unto him who has not even what he has shall be taken away from him . <p> If you look at Africa today how is that our minerals are taken away from us , from Ghana , from Nigeria , DR Congo , from indeed every country in Africa , our gold , timber , oil , is taken away from us and they are given away to those who have . If you look at us today , if there were a miracle to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all of us would be naked , because the cloths that you were none of them were made in Africa , the ties that you wear , none of them were made in Africa , even the underwear 's that we wear none of them were made in Africa . The question is , are we children of a lesser god ? No we are not . But we have allowed ourselves to be corrupt in our ways and in our morals . Our leaders steal from us and they keep the money in Europe and America , they are scared to keep it in Africa where they stole it from . The question is for how long will we allow this to happen . All the holy books whether it is the Holy bible or the Holy Quran are unanimous in one thing , that if we want to liberate ourselves from the dehumanizing conditions of extreme poverty and chains of suffering , we must do something about it . I look forward to a day when the works of Chinua Achebe in his book things fall apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people shall no longer be true that the African is corrupt through and through . I look forward to a day when Africa shall not be a winner in the equivalent of Olympic medals is the wrong things such as corruption indices as prepared by Transparency International . But the sad truth is that good laws out of themselves do not fight corruption , because if it were just good laws , what is better than the ten commandments , but you and I know that we owe the ten commandments in bridge . So we must have something , a change of heart , a total change , a DNA transplant , a character transplant , so that our dominant instincts becomes the instincts to do that which is right and good . Not so long ago , the African Union came out with a slogan saying ' Africa 2063'that if we as Africans have lost 50 years , let not this generation lose another 50 years . The question is , are we going to gain Africa by mere pronouncement or we must change ourselves ? We must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer attracted to that which is bad and evil , the question is are we ready ? The question is do we say with our mouths what we do not believe with our hearts ? The question is , are we going to wait for outsiders to tell us to do that which we ought to have done ? The question is are we prepared to sacrifice our lives for that which is good and right ? The question is beyond the comforts of our homes are we going to roll up the sleeves and meet the poor and oppressed and desperate in the grassroots ? The question is are we ready ? I am of the conviction that until there is a paradigm shift in our mindsets and attitude , Africa has a long way to go . And I have no doubt that it can be done , and it must be done , and it will be done , because if it is not done we are done . @ @

With all the unprecedented near-institutional corruption , dubious judgment debt payments and all the " create , loot and share " policies masterminded by the Mahama-led NDC government to impoverish mother Ghana , they are very convinced that Ghanaians will still vote massively to re-elect them come 2016 elections . This is all because , Ghanaians are mostly " enye hwee , fa ma Nyame " people hence having a short memory .

@@1956238 trip wiselyTravellers in today 's internet age have an amazing ability to control which route , airline , and even the type of aircraft they want . Unlike the earlier days ( up until the 1990s ) , where you would call a travel agent and request a flight on a specific date to a specific destination and simply hope it would not be a small plane ; now you can make these choices yourself . Whether it is the airline website or travel agent website such as Travelocity or Expedia etc , take your time and play around with different dates and different flight times . <p> I recommend taking the most direct route if available ( non-stop ) , and choosing one of the larger airlines as many people with a fear of flying feel more comfortable with the larger interior space ( Airbus A330 , A340 , A380 , or Boeing 747 , 767 , 777 ) . <p> 2 . Arrive at the airport early and observeLook at each plane as it takes off and see how routine the process is . Chase the plane visually until it disappears in the air or becomes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can turn your attention to the next takeoff . Imagine yourself in each of these planes , how nervous you would be when you are inside it - the speed , the sounds of the flaps , and the roaring engine . Now , think about what you are actually looking at - a smooth and ordinary takeoff which is almost boring to watch . <p> As you observe each plane , continue to switch between these two different roles , one as an observer of a commonplace and mundane takeoff , and the other as a passenger inside that plane . Now , promise yourself that you will remember this typical scene during your flight 's takeoff as if you were watching it from the waiting area . <p> 3 . Pick the right seatUnless you 're one of the few lucky ones who can afford to fly business or first class , the seat you will be allocated will not offer you much legroom . For the folks who fear flying , being in an enclosed space makes matters worse for them . So always try to choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to pay a little extra for these seats , it 's well worth it . An aisle seat is also highly recommended , as it gives you the feeling of extra space . <p> 4 . Wake up early <p> Some people might suggest having a good night 's sleep before your flight , but by doing so , you 'll probably stay awake for the entire duration of the flight . I recommend getting as little sleep as possible before your flight , it simply increases your chances ( even by the slightest percentage ) of taking a nap , and by that , shortening your flight time . <p> 5 . Expect unfamiliar sounds and be realisticEvery flight will make some unfamiliar sounds , such as gear retractions or flap movement . Remember that any machine has sound , whether it was your car or dishwasher - why expect a plane not to have any ? They are perfectly normal , and honestly I would be worried if the plane did not make machine-like sounds . You are not an aeronautic engineer , so when you hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal unless someone tells you otherwise . <p> 6 . Mute the engine noiseI 'm not suggesting you ask the pilot to turn one of the engines off during your flight ( not a smart safety move ) , but you can do something about not hearing it anymore . Many fearful flyers become hyper listeners during the flight , because their brain is programmed to believe there will be some sort of life-threatening problem and will try to prove it by listening for the faintest of sounds . <p> The best solution for this problem is to use sound cancelling headphones . Once the pilot gives you permission to use electronic devices , crank up your favourite tunes loaded on your phone or MP player , and close your eyes . See No Evil , Hear No Evil . <p> 7 . Look at the flight crewWhile on the plane , look at the cabin crew . Notice how they are smiling and pleasant ( well , we can only hope ) , but more importantly , notice how comfortable they are and busy doing their work . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; otherwise these trained experts would have left the plane while they still could . <p> 8 . Talk to the pilot before boardingIf you can , try to locate your pilot ( they usually arrive with their crew and head towards your boarding gate entrance ) . Do n't be shy , pilots are very nice and understanding . Tell him or her that you will be onboard their flight and you have a fear of flying . Tell them exactly what bothers you ( takeoff , air bumps etc ) . <p> From my personal experience in doing so , most pilots spend several minutes explaining the nature of these sounds and the reasons behind the bumps . It 's so comforting to hear it from the pilot . Notice how comfortable they are when talking about these matters . <p> 9 . Expect air bumpsThe biggest nightmare for a fearful flyer is usually air-turbulence . Remember this simple fact , planes do not crash because of air bumps . Another good fact to remember is the seat belt light goes on because the pilot does not want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not because there is any type of flight risk . <p> Most pilots will tell you that they try to take a slight detour ( or change altitude ) to avoid bump for the comfort of their passengers ( not to avoid mid-air disaster ) . Seriously , be honest with yourself , is n't a flight so much smoother than a car ride ? <p> 10 . Pick calm routesThe internet can provide you with great information about expected turbulence . See which routes historically have less bumps ( usually , but not always , it will be routes far away from mountain ranges or places with a high frequency of thunderstorms ) . <p> 11 . Find ways to make the trip seem shorterIf you sit and worry , every minute of your flight will feel like an hour . Think of your favourite time-killing product - a fashion magazine ; a portable video game ; the latest electronic gadget , or a relaxing book - and go get it ! <p> Do n't force yourself to enjoy your hobby while the plane is hitting air bumps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more nervous . This step is most useful during smooth flying as a way to pass the time . <p> 12 . Do n't think about the takeoffWhat 's the point of running the takeoff scenario in your head ? Nothing ! The more you think about it , the more worried you will be , and the more opportunities your brain will have to imagine ridiculous disaster situations . Just think about anything , absolutely anything , except the flight itself . <p> 13 . Fly oftenDo more of something you fear and fear will disappear . Catch a flight when you have the time and can afford it - it 's hard to do at first , but the more you do it , the quicker the fear will go away . Plus , you 'll get to see new places and enjoy life . What a deal .
