@@31620233 <h> 72 years of Independence-Freedom to pursue personal needs and wants <p> **40;2126;TOOLONG years of **37;2168;TOOLONG <p> This year we are celebrating the seventy second anniversary after gaining independence . It is , therefore , high time now to contemplate as to whether we have made all efforts to make the best use of the independence which our forefathers have won not easily but after struggling much . It was not a gift of God or a donation but was something our forefathers wrestled from the foreigners . We are the legitimate owners of our motherland . Foreigners invaded and snatched it from us . <p> They were neither the heirs nor the owners of our country . Hence , it was the responsibility on their part to hand over to us everything which was and which is our own . What they have handed over to us on February 4 , 1948 was a country which had been exploited . It was something like the refuse of what had been chewed . We were required to rebuild our country to satisfy ourselves that we are truly independent . <p> The true meaning of Independence <p> According to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation or a state in which the residents and the population or some portion thereof exercise self government over its territory . J.R.Turner defines the term independence as " the freedom to separate ourselves from personal ideologies and intellectually challenge to see the full scope of an issue in order to find real solutions for the good of the whole . " Independence means that we must not depend on the opinions of others but we should rely on factual issues and actions of the individuals and our governments . <p> UNO 's dependence of nations belonged to British Empire <p> In a way the UNO is an organization established in order to keep the countries of the British Empire still dependent . Non aligned movement was set up by countries which wished to stand on their own feet without being dependent on big powers . The first large scale Asian-African Conference , also known as the Bandung Conference was a meeting of Asian-African states of which had gained independence newly . It took place from April 18 to 25 , 1955 in Bandung , Indonesia . The twenty nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourth of the world 's land surface and a population of 1.5 billion . The conference was organized by Burma , India , Indonesia and Sri Lanka . The conference 's stated aims were to promote Afro-Asian economic and cultural cooperation and oppose colonialism or neo-colonization . <p> Independence <p> Further , independence means the state of choosing to empower ourselves with the information to make our own minds independently . According to another definition independence means the freedom to create a world or society in which the people can perceive nations through a satellite view rather than a microscope view and make value judgments based on what is good for the future rather than for the present . True independence means recognizing that every type of thought and belief system has something to teach , to offer and if we learn from those in our world our chances of creating a real change for the betterment of all will be increased . Wisdom demands that we should further own independence by freeing our self from the prison of personal experience by embracing realities other than our own and thereby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the quality of being independent , freedom from dependence and exemption from reliance on or controlled by others . This is the state of self-subsistence or maintenance , direction of one 's own affairs without unnecessary interference which provides sufficient means for a comfortable livelihood . <p> People 's rights <p> In a sense independence is an opportunity for the people to avail of their rights . Jurists and thinkers of France having based on the 1789 Declaration and afterwards have enumerated four rights i.e. <p> i.The right to be treated equally with others in the eye of law and all legislative acts , <p> ii.The right to be treated equally with others in matters of Justice and in the courts of law , <p> iii.The right to be treated equally with others in matters of taxation so that each man pays the same proportion of his means as paid by others , and <p> iv.The right to be treated equally admissible with others to public honours and offices of employment . <p> We have learned to think not only of what may be called political equality , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community and we have accordingly come to believe that there are further rights which ought to be added to the rights of political equality . These rights are still as they were in the process of construction . They are emerging from the social thought and beginning to pass into the common conviction in the form of political community . However , the exact extent of its dimension have still to be determined by the continuing process of social thought and by the method of tentative experiment . They are the rights which men are beginning to claim and in relation to governing authority and the distribution of its incidence , but in relation to one another , the measure of general equality between man and the man partly in economic status and the distribution of the economic possessions and partly in educational opportunities and enjoyment of the general treasures of culture .

" The yield in the small holdings of the South is 2300 kg per hectare , while in the RPC estates it is around 1000 kg per hectare . The total annual production by the small holders and RPCs is in the ratio 70:30 , a reversal from the historic 30:70 , " Yogarajan pointed out . <p> " The workers are always willing to bring in the crop . They do not leave any tender leaf un-plucked and deliberately bring in less . In the small holdings in the South , the workers pluck 24 to 26 kg per day as the norm , whereas in the upcountry in the RPCs , it is 16 to 18 kg . This is only because there is no flush in the RPC-held big estates , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a captain of the tea industry , Mahendra Amarasuriya , in a speech he delivered at the Planters ' Association in 2012 . Amarasuriya said : " Regarding human productivity there are many challenges . Firstly , until the crop yields are increased one can not expect workers to harvest more than what is potentially available in the fields . The logical means of increasing productivity of plantations is replanting in both Tea and Rubber . " <p> Hence the whole blame for the deterioration of the tea industry has to be placed at the door of the RPCs , Yogarajan underlined . <p> " The RPCs , which cover a sprawling 5000 to 7000 hectares , were sold to private companies by the government in 1992-93 for a mere Rs.100 million in the hope that the companies ( mostly in trade ) would invest in replanting and development . But the companies have merely taken the crop with minimum input and sold for profits . In addition they have also exploited the timber and scrap for cash flow , " he charged . <p> Consultant R.K. Nathaniel writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had said that a survey conducted by the Tea Research Institute ( TRI ) in 2003 , ten years after the plantations were privatized , showed that only 0.7% had been replanted by the RPCs . <p> The pace of replanting in the past decade , was the greatest in the low country , at 0.98% per year of the total tea extent ; followed by high country at 0.81% , mid-country at 0.49% , and was the lowest in the Uva region at 0.44% , Nathaniel said , and added that it is adequately documented and commonly accepted that if the industry is to keep pace with the rate of ageing , and decline in the productivity of the older seedling tea , then re-planting should proceed at a minimum of 2% per annum of the total extent of tea . This is based on the premise that replacement of the tea stock should take place every 50 years . <p> According to Yogarajan , if the RPC 's had maintained the 2% replanting rate during the 27 years that they managed the estates , 50% of the tea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have increased and the workers could have been more productive like in the South . <p> Alternatives available <p> Nathaniel said that in 2005 , the total land area covered by the 304 tea growing estates was 171,454 hectares , of this 29 , 524 hectares was either not cultivated or were put to other use . " A proper evaluation of such land could reveal that an appreciable extent could be identified for appropriate diversification to other environmentally suitable economic pursuits which could generate employment , " he observed . <p> In his 2012 address to the Planters Association , Mahendra Amarasuriya had suggested the planting of cinnamon , nutmeg , arecanut , oil palm or whatever depending upon the prevailing agro-climatic conditions . <p> Strategies to meet replanting expense <p> RPCs say that re-planting is expensive . But there are ways to get round this problem . Nathaniel suggested that the government could fund it with the support of an international donor agency till such time as a satisfactory and sustainable Revolving Fund is established by the RPCs themselves . The amount drawn from the Revolving Fund could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a period of say four years so that the fund is regularly replenished , he said . <p> In 2012 , Amarasuriya told the Planters ' Association that cultivable land not used by an RPC could be given to the workers on a contractual basis to plant tea with the facilitation of the company concerned . Since the worker has at least a partial hold on the land , he will look after it and the crop which he grows . He will also replant on time and keep his livelihood sustained over time . Migration from the tea plantations to the urban areas for work with better pay will come down and the danger of a labour shortage in the plantations will be staved off . However , there is a catch in this . Amarasuriya warned that this scheme could run into a political storm given the reluctance of the Sri Lankan political system to give land to the estate workers even on a time-bound contractual basis . The trade unions too could resist because workers would become cultivators and loosen their links with the unions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amarasuriya 's proposal , R.Yogarajan said that unused estate land could be given to the worker on a contract for a fixed period and on the condition that the worker supplies tea leaves only to the company from which he had taken the land on contract . <p> " This will not amount to handing over ownership of the land to the workers . At any rate the ownership will lie ultimately with the government as the RPCs themselves are holding their estates on a lease from the government , " Yogarajan pointed out . <p> With growing , plucking and replanting being done by the workers in their allotted small plots , the RPCs ' expenditure on these works and labour will come down , he added . Yogarajan is hoping to taking up his proposal with the highest echelons of the Gotabaya-Mahinda Rajapaksa government at the earliest . <p> Productivity linked wages <p> The RPC 's have for long advocated a productivity-based wage structure . But fixing it assumes uniformity in the plantations , Yogarajan pointed out . " Apart from the wage , all other parameters will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . But conditions vary from estate field to estate field , due to the age of the bushes or trees and other agricultural inputs and practices . Under this circumstance , it is not possible to fix an all-industry productivity norm . It may be feasible in an industry where conditions are controllable , " he said . The late Dr. N.Yogaratnam , a plantations expert , had written that there is academic evidence that performance-related pay does not work when it is applied to any work involving " cognitive rather than physical skill . " <p> " Research has repeatedly demonstrated that when the task is mechanical and purely physical , performance-related pay works . However , once even rudimentary cognitive skills are required , it does not work and actually leads to frustration and poor performance . Tea plucking is not entirely mechanical .

The Minister went onto note that the CEB will become a profitable organisation once again by 2023 . <p> While the intentions of the Minister are good , the Minister also has a responsibility to investigate the losses suffered by the CEB . <p> The 300 Megawatt LNG powerplant which was stated by Minister Mahinda Amaraweera is a project which has not been realized for several years . There are no supply and storage facilities for LNG plants in our country . Accordingly , this power station will be built to operate on diesel or fuel before being eventually converted into an LNG power plant . <p> The tender process pertaining to the Kerawalapitiya plant has been continuously mired in corruption . Under the previous administration , a decision was made to award the tender to Lanka Transformers Limited , a company in which the CEB holds a majority of shares . This decision had been made while eliminating companies which have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are capable of benefitting the country . <p> The bids put forward by Lanka Transformers Limited for each unit of electricity were made to seem lower than the other companies , by excluding taxes .

The government held 50% of the shares in West Coast Power , while the CEB-owned Lanka Electricity Company Limited held 18.2% of the shares , with the Employees ' Provident Fund and Lakdahnavi Limited holding 27.1% and 4.8% of the shares respectively . <p> As per this division of shares , the CEB should have earned a majority of the profits generated by this company .

According to that revelation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had received 39.75% of the total profits . <p> When the report pertaining to the division of profits had been studied by the Auditor General 's Department on the 8th of March in 2016 , it was stated that the CEB should have received Rs 7.1 billion . However , financial records show that the CEB had received only Rs 6.9 billion . <p> Who benefitted indirectly through these deals ?

We do so conscious of the fact that , of the period of 1 year since the adoption of Resolution 40/1 , and 4 ? years since the adoption of the initial Resolution 30/1 , our government has been in power for only a little over 100 days out of the said period . <p> In responding to the High Commissioner 's Report ; <p> I wish to recall that , during the 40th Session of this Council , almost one year ago , the Government of Sri Lanka ( GoSL ) was represented by a delegation headed by my predecessor , the former Minister of Foreign Affairs , who , in Sri Lanka 's statement , explained at length the constitutional , legal and socio-political challenges involved in ' fully implementing ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the High Commissioner 's insistence in the current Report on the " full implementation " of the demands made on Sri Lanka in Resolution 30/1 indicates that the OHCHR fails to recognise the rational and legitimate concerns voiced by States that are seeking , in good faith , to address issues . <p> The Government rejects the reference in the High Commissioner 's Report that the results of Sri Lanka 's Presidential Election of November 2019 " reflected an electorate highly polarized along ethnic lines . " In this regard , we consider it pertinent to remind this Council that particularly with reference to the electorates of the Northern and Eastern provinces where , consistent with the national average , polling averaged over 70% , the two main contenders who were from the Sinhala community , together polled over 90% of the vote . Sri Lankans of all ethnicities and religions forming 52.25% of the population of the country gave a clear mandate to President Gotabaya Rajapaksa in this election , which was undisputedly accepted as free and fair , including by foreign election observers . The President 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , to find home-grown solutions to overcome contemporary challenges in the best interests of all Sri Lankans to usher in security , development and a disciplined society . <p> The Government wishes to reject the references made in the High Commissioner 's Report , to the OHCHR Investigation on Sri Lanka ( OISL ) Report of September 2015 . As highlighted before this Council on several occasions , Sri Lanka has consistently refuted the credibility of the false and unsubstantiated allegations leveled against Lieutenant General Shavendra Silva , the present Commander of Sri Lanka Army and Actg . Chief of Defence Staff ( CDS ) , which have been repeated in the current Report of the High Commissioner by citing " the United Nations Secretary-General 's Panel of Experts on Accountability in Sri Lanka and the OHCHR Investigation on Sri Lanka " . In this regard , Sri Lanka urges this Council 's to take note of the following important facts : <p> It must be reiterated that Lt. Gen. Silva was appointed as the Commander of the Army by the then Head of State , taking into account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allegations of human rights violations against him . His elevation as the Actg . Chief of Defence Staff ( CDS ) by the current Head of State President Gotabaya Rajapaksa was on account of his being the senior most serving military officer , on the retirement of the previous CDS . <p> The statements in the report in this regard are based on much disputed ex-parte reports . The OISL Report of 2015 also made clear that it was " a human rights investigation and not a criminal investigation " , and that " the names provided in the description of the chain of command do not imply criminal responsibility for those particularly alleged violations listed in this report , either as direct responsibility or under command or superior responsibility . Individual criminal responsibility can only be determined by a Court of Law with all necessary due process guaranteed . " The Darusman Report of 2011 was so seriously flawed that the Human Rights Council at the time had rejected to issue it with a formal number , as a UN document . <p> The Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which were domestic processes that examined the allegations particularly with regard to the last stages of the conflict , have not found substantive evidence against the conduct of the current Army Commander , who has testified in person before both Commissions . <p> In view of the foregoing , Sri Lanka considers that the continued arbitrary accusations made against Lt. Gen. Silva in OHCHR Reports and other statements made in this Council and unilateral actions by certain countries , are unacceptable and a violation of the principles of natural justice . <p> We also stress that there are no proven allegations against individuals on war crimes or crimes against humanity in the OISL report or in any subsequent official document . It is an injustice to deprive any serving or retired officer of the Sri Lankan security forces or the police of their due rights . <p> With regard to alleged " intimidating visits " , " surveillance " , complaints of harassment " and " reprisals " referred to in the High Commissioner 's Report , we wish to reiterate our invitation to the parties concerned to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions such as the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka or the National Police Commission , so that action can be taken to investigate the alleged incidents . The Government has already publicly refuted these allegations , and is committed to protecting and promoting freedom of expression and civil society space , and ensure that complaints received on alleged attacks against journalists , human rights defenders and civil society are investigated and prosecuted . <p> At the same time , we consider it pertinent to caution this Council about certain segments who attempt to fabricate false narratives of intimidation and harassment by the State , which the Government of Sri Lanka has , of late , successfully disproved with solid evidence . <p> We also reiterate that , apart from operating routine security networks in the interest of national security , particular after the devastating Easter Sunday terrorist attacks , the Security Forces and intelligence agencies are not engaged in monitoring any specific group of people in the country . I believe for any country , compromising its national security interests amidst looming sophistication of strategies of radical and extreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hence , we invite all parties to this council to be mindful of that stark reality when making recommendations related to security sector reforms . <p> With respect to references in the report to the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution that established Provincial Councils , it must be noted that , soon after the end of the conflict , the citizens in the Northern Province were able to use their franchise at a Provincial Council election after a lapse of 25 years , a right that had been denied to residents of the Northern Province by the LTTE . Elections for the Eastern Provincial Council had also been held in May 2008 shortly after the liberation of the Eastern province . However , the near two year delay in holding Provincial Council elections in any part of the country , by the previous Government which co-sponsored Resolution 30/1 , with the active support of Members of Parliament representing the North and East , has hampered the operationalization of devolution of power as mandated by the constitution of Sri Lanka . The new Government , is committed to holding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suitable amendments being made to the requirements that are needed to conduct the Provincial Council elections in terms of the law . <p> With regard to the situation of refugees and asylum seekers following the incidents on 21 April 2019 , that is being referred to in the report , it is worth to inform this council that the Government guaranteed the safety and security of displaced asylum seekers and refugees , in collaboration with the UNHCR . While they were relocated to more secure venues , voluntarily , as a precautionary measure , some have returned to their original places of residence in recent weeks . Police and Army have provided adequate security to locations where they are currently housed , and the GoSL , the UNHCR and NGOs provide food , health and other services . No reprisals , physical attacks or other form of subsequent violence against this vulnerable population has been reported . <p> As to the concerns expressed in the Report on " steps to resume implementation of the death penalty " , it may be noted that Sri Lanka continues to maintain a Moratorium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its re-imposition being made from time to time . As may be recalled , Sri Lanka has voted in favour of the biennial UNGA Resolution on the universal Moratorium on the death penalty in 2007 , 2008 , 2010 , 2016 , and as recently as in 2018 . As a mature democracy , Sri Lanka believes in accommodating a diverse spectrum of views on any issue of public interest , and the discourse pertaining to the reimplementation of the death penalty . The Council may note that , in contrast to serious and repeated concerns raised in this Council in 2019 on possible revoking of the moratorium on the death penalty , no firm decision has been taken by the Government , to date , to resume implementation of the death penalty and the execution of death penalty is presently under review before the Supreme Court in several Fundamental Rights cases . <p> We wish to reiterate to the Council Sri Lanka 's commitment expressed during the High-Level Segment to achieve sustainable peace through an inclusive , domestically designed and executed reconciliation and accountability process , in line with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Government envisages to take the following steps ; <p> The existing reconciliation mechanisms established by an Act of Parliament such as the Office on Mission Persons ( OMP ) and the Office of Reparations ( OR ) will be continued , with appropriate adaptation in line with Government policy framework . With regard to the issue on missing persons , steps would be taken , after necessary investigations , to issue death certificates or certificates of absence , while also providing livelihood and other assistance to affected families ; <p> A Commission of Inquiry ( COI ) , headed by a Justice of the Supreme Court , will be appointed to review the reports of previous Sri Lankan COIs which investigated alleged violations of Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law ( IHL ) , to assess the status of implementation of their recommendations , and to propose deliverable measures to implement them keeping in line with the new Government 's policy ; <p> National law enforcement systems will continue to investigate and prosecute cases on all allegations of torture and other human rights violations that are currently before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this approach of focusing on deliverable measures of reconciliation that are in line with the interest of Sri Lanka and its people , instead of the practice of taking on a host of undeliverable commitments with the intention of never implementing them . <p> Madam President , <p> In addition to these core processes , aiming at building a just and disciplined society , the Government will work towards addressing other outstanding concerns in a manner consistent with its voluntary obligations under the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda . These measures aimed at advancing individual and collective rights , ensuring justice and reconciliation , and addressing the concerns of vulnerable sections of the society , will be taken through due democratic and legal processes including institutional reform where necessary . In taking these initiatives forward , the Government has before it the National Plan for the Protection and Promotion of Human Rights 2017-2021 including with input from the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka . <p> In this respect , we are pleased to inform this Council of the following key initiatives and achievements of the Government : <p> A majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i.e. 89.26% of State lands and 92.22% of private lands , have already been released to their civilian owners by 31 December 2019 . The Government will pay appropriate compensation in respect of private lands that the security forces would need to retain in view of compelling national security imperatives . <p> The Government will undertake a review of thePrevention of Terrorism Act ( PTA ) with a view to proposing necessary amendments to its provisions . As for persons detained under the PTA , in order to expedite the cases , 3 additional courts have been established in Vavuniya , Mannar and Anuradhapura , besides the Colombo High Court . <p> We will continue to engage in a constructive manner with the regular processes and mechanisms of the UN and this Council including the Special Procedures , Treaty Bodies and the UPR process which we consider as a balanced peer-review mechanism that treats all states equally . As this Council may recognise , Sri Lanka has over the past 6 years , received an unprecedented number of over 10 visits by Special Procedures and Treaty Body mechanisms in official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 7 Treaty Body reviews and its third cycle of UPR . In continuation of this engagement , the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Education will visit Sri Lanka in June-July this year . <p> Efforts will be taken to strengthen important independent institutions such as the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka ( HRCSL ) and the Right to Information Commission . <p> Steps will be taken to address concerns related to alleged persecution of religious minorities and to safeguard persons of all faiths . An amendment to the Penal code is under consideration on preventing hate speech , inciting hatred among communities through mainstream as well as social media networks . <p> In view of concerns raised over the existing Victims of Crime and Witnesses Protection Authority Act amendments to the current victim protection regime are being formulated by the Legal Draftsman 's Department , pursuant to proposals made by a Committee appointed by the former Minister of Justice and with a view to bringing it on par with international standards and best practices . <p> In keeping with Sri Lanka 's longstanding and Constitutional commitment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and disabled persons , a number of reforms and measures have been initiated . These include the Children ( Judicial Protection ) Bill , a National Alternative Care Policy , raising the minimum age of employment and education to 16 , and an amendment to the Penal Code prohibiting obscene publications using children and preventing child pornography , in line with Article 9 of the Budapest Cybercrime Convention . As this Council deliberated on the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child , I believe these actions would testify to our unwavering commitment to the welfare of our children-the future of the country . <p> We will continue to protect and promote the rights of women by effectively implementing the National Plan of Action for addressing Sexual and Gender Based Violence , economically empowering female headed households and developing an Action Plan on the implementation of the UN Resolution 1325 titled " Women , Peace and Security " in collaboration with UN Women . <p> A Draft Bill seeking to incorporate the standards in the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities into the national law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a society with equal opportunities . <p> Appropriate steps would be taken , including legislation where necessary , to trace and take action on proceeds of crime , in line with the Financial Action Task Force ( FATF ) recommendations related to anti-money laundering and countering terrorism financing . <p> With a view to further eliminating delays in court processes , the ' court automation ' project will be strengthened to upgrade the efficiency of court procedure . <p> Madam President , <p> The Government intends to undertake a stocktaking of the progress made so far in the implementation of SDGs and will identify areas where international partners including the UN can assist further in measure progress on the " 5 Ps " that shape the SDGs : People , Planet , Prosperity , Peace , and Partnerships <p> While acknowledging that international cooperation , technical assistance and capacity- building are provided with the consent of the concerned State as mandated in UNGA resolution 60/251 in line with the needs and priorities of each State to suit its own unique political , economic and social circumstances , we request the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own mechanisms to address issues of reconciliation and accountability without prejudging . <p> Within the above parameters , we look forward to continuing our engagement with the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights , UN Human Rights mechanisms and procedures , and to continue to work in close cooperation with the international community through capacity building and technical assistance in mutually agreed areas , in keeping with domestic priorities and policies .

As such my entry into the world of fashion was easy . <p> Q : How have women become empowered through the fashion industry throughout the years ? <p> A : The fashion industry has gone from strength to strength over the years . There are many fashion designing schools today all over the world . It is truly an amazing career for women . Designing can be very therapeutic and rewarding as one often deals with beautiful colours and silhouettes . The designers are able to provide job opportunities to people in all walks of life thus giving them the much needed income .

How do you see the girl and the woman in today 's context ? <p> A : I was only 17 years when I married and started a family . I was a bored housewife then and started creating batiks as a hobby in the early 70s . I never dreamt of starting a business . The girl in the 70s was na ? ve and very shy , and unaware of her creative ability . As the business grew my confidence in the Yoland brand and my abilities also grew . My exposure in the international fashion arena gave validation not only to my brand but to me as a fashion designer . <p> Yolanda Aluwihare is an award winning fashion designer who has received much international acclaim . She was also a pioneer in the Sri Lankan batik @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been an advocate for women and their rights for many years . Could you briefly tell us about the history of women 's activism in Sri Lanka ? <p> A : . Women activists and scholars have been at the forefront of a variety of initiatives to protest , analyse and redress patriarchal domination as well as religious , class , caste and ethnic oppression of women and other marginalized groups such as the LGBTQI communities . The three decades of civil war we have lived through along with violent youth uprisings , suicide bombings and major ' natural ' disasters such as the tsunami have greatly challenged and often overwhelmed our activist agendas . We have had to fight oppressive patriarchal and capitalist structures while simultaneously seeking to heal the emotional scars of a significant population that have witnessed a myriad atrocities , and are struggling to support family members who are either physically or mentally wounded . <p> Q : Domestic violence is rampant in Sri Lanka . What are the major causes for it and what remedial measures ( other than legal ) can be taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is crucial that we think of a variety of alternatives to combat domestic violence . It is primarily a display of power and aggression against those who are vulnerable and less powerful be it economically , socially or psychologically . Sri Lankan women are not adequately respected by their male relatives be it fathers , brothers , husbands or sons . They are often perceived as the property of the patriarchs in the family . Our dowry system also enables such thinking as it leads to the commodification , barter , and exchange of women . <p> Until we change how we as a society perceive women and treat women , both publicly and privately , we will not be able to eradicate DV . No doubt , changing perceptions of society is a major , long-term undertaking but we can take small steps towards that by writing textbooks , producing advertisements , tele dramas , films etc. , that do n't stereotype and caricature women , and most importantly , by teaching our children through our own everyday actions , how to treat girls and women with respect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value their opinions and ideas . <p> Malathi de Alwis is a Socio-Cultural Anthropologist and a feminist and environmental activist . She teaches in the Women and Gender Studies Program , Faculty of Graduate Studies , University of Colombo . <p> Swarna Mallawarachchi <p> Q : When you entered the field of acting in 1968 what kind of status did an actress have ? Did she have equal status as the actor ? <p> A : When I started acting I came in with a group of people who were very much out-of-the box and forward thinking , such as , Prof. Siri Gunasinghe , D. B. Nihalsinghe and Vasantha Obeysekera . I would call them an independent group . <p> My first film Sath Samudura was done with them and I did not face any discrimination . Neither did I face any discrimination in my subsequent films such as , Hantane Kathawa ( directed by Sugathapala Senarath Yapa . ) Ahasgawuwa ( by Dhramasena Pathiraja ) Tunman Handiya ( by Mahagamasekera ) , Mathara Achchi ( by Sathischandra ) among them . Later on I heard that there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not faced any discrimination throughout my career . <p> I must also state here that the late Gamini Fonseka fought tirelessly to make life better for the actors and actresses , and gain due respect in society . Unfortunately , not many people seem to remember this . <p> A : Not really . It does not cover them enough.There are directors who would like to make very strong films about women , but there are obstacles such as Censor Board issues , and the long wait for the release . Therefore , sadly , women 's issues are not discussed enough in Sri Lankan films at present . <p> From the end of late 1960 to 1990 directors like Dharmasiri Bandaranaike , Vasantha Obeysekera , Sumithra Peiris , Parakrama Niriella , Prasanna Vithanage and Asoka Handagama did produce films highlighting women 's issues . Making a film is a most expensive art and if you ca n't get it released early , it becomes a huge problem for the investors . <p> Q : Screen violence against women : do you feel this has an impact on real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2005 , I was the Goodwill Ambassador for ' violence against women ' for UNHCR . <p> The film Dadayama(1984) was a groundbreaking one in this sense . Rathmali Kekulawela , the heroine ( played by me ) goes after the man who betrayed her till the end . I feel this has had a great impact on our women who hitherto had been rather passive and lukewarm about injustices meted out to them . They have now become much more proactive in fighting injustice . <p> A : When I write a novel , a short story , a poem or script I do not think about or consciously highlight women 's issues . It is natural for truth to come out in a writer 's creation . In all my books the problems faced by women who are more than 50 per cent of the country 's population were portrayed naturally . <p> Q : Do you feel that your writing has had an effect on the status of women with regard to gender bias and equality ? <p> A : When I write a novel I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can understand the problems of the Sri Lankan women . They are victims of poverty , discrimination and cultural and social bias . Some are prisoners in their own households . My opinion is that we have to empower women , so the characters in my novels are women who inspire the empowerment of other women , the community and society . <p> Q : How do you perceive the activism on various issues concerning women ? Is it an effective lobby or does it need strengthening ? <p> A : If we consider the global context by placing gender equality and women 's rights as the core function of activism the efforts of various movements in the field have been successful in advancing the cause of gender equality . However , there is still a long way to go . Now , our Government is giving serious consideration to issues concerning women .

THASL commended the government 's commitment to grant interim relief for all businesses including tourism businesses to stay afloat and help maintain livelihoods . " The Rs.50 billion relief package released by the Central Bank on 27 March 2020 , for all businesses including self employed individuals , is timely , resourceful and commendable . This immediate action is greatly appreciated at a time when the Government is faced with a momentous task of battling a pandemic , which has brought the entire world to its knees , " a THASL statement said . " On behalf of the tourism industry , THASL wishes to express their sincere thanks and gratitude to His Excellency , the President , the Prime Minister ; Dr. P.B. Jayasundera , the Secretary to the President , the Central Bank , the Treasury , the Minister of Tourism ; and the Chairperson of Sri Lanka @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Below is the full THASL statement . Importance of the tourism industry We see the Government 's immediate action to expressly protect the tourism industry as their endorsement of the great importance of our industry to the economic well being of Sri Lanka . Tourism is one of the fastest growing industries in the world . One in ten people across the world and one in five Sri Lankans are engaged in the tourism industry . We are the second highest net foreign exchange earner for Sri Lanka having brought in USD 4.5 billion in foreign exchange in 2018 and the potential of becoming a USD 10 billion industry in the next five years . Extension of relief period Unfortunately , tourism has also been the most directly and immediately impacted industry since the outbreak of this pandemic . Tourism has been brought to a standstill , leading to the closure of businesses and the loss of livelihoods . This crisis comes at a time when the tourism industry had just started its recovery after the horrors of the Easter Sunday attacks last year . Therefore , we request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be placed for a minimum 2 year period until businesses can stabilise . Request for a Government-backed wage support scheme We sincerely appreciate the multi-pronged relief strategies of the Government to avert the immediate collapse of business and the entire tourism sector . Having taken stock of the impact on this criss on tourism and with no immediate recovery in sight , we wish to draw your attention once again to a crucial consideration from the urgent measures that we previously recommended - the introduction of a wage support scheme . Tourism-related businesses have entered an unprecedented period of zero revenues now . Our industry members no longer have any revenue to pay the salaries of their staff . THASL members have a payroll responsibility of Rs.6 billion for the next six months . The industry is yet to recover from last year 's Easter attacks . Following the attacks , our members have become highly indebted . We have no more reserves in hand and limited capacity to take on more debt . A number of tourism-dependent countries have given relief packages that have included direct grants by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospitality . Without such support , these countries understand that closed tourism businesses will not be in a position to salvage the livelihoods of the very large segment of their population dependent on the tourism industry . We appreciate the restrictive fiscal situation of the Government . Therefore , we plead with you to consider a 6 month , Government-sponsored , wage support scheme to those earning a monthly wage of Rs 40,000 or less . This forms the majority of our workforce . The wage support scheme will be in the form of direct grants by the Government to pay for the salaries of employees in tourism earning a monthly wage of Rs. 40,000 or less . The grant can be made directly to the employer based on submission of payroll . Further measures In line with the global response by Governments to support critical industries following the COVID19 pandemic , we press on the Government to strongly consider the proposed measures below . Request for continuation of working capital loans at 4% interest with long-term payback At the expiry of the 6 month wage-support scheme , we propose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion re-financing facility until tourism rebounds . We propose for tourism businesses to continue to have access to low-interest working capital loans to pay the salaries of employees until tourism rebounds . We also propose that the repayment period for these loans to be long term ( i.e. between 5 - 10 years ) in order to reduce the impact on business . EPF/ETF contribution penalties to be waived The liquidity position of tourism businesses is fast eroding . We therefore request the Government to waive all EPF/ETF penalties until April 2021 . Waiver of electricity and water bills for a period of 6 months Although currently most hotels are experiencing zero occupancy , hotels are still incurring heavy utility costs to maintain their facilities . Therefore , we request the Government to waive all electricity and water charges for the next 6 months . Municipality and Local Government taxes to be same as those charged from other industries Since 2008 , hotels in Sri Lanka have been subject to a discriminatory 1% tax on turnover by municipalities and local governments . This tax is only apply applicable to hotels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service fees that are already charged by and paid to local authorities by hotels . All other businesses pay a flat Rs. 6000 for trade licenses . Hotels have been in court since 2008 .

However , we are confident that measures taken by the Government and our healthcare professionals can ensure a quicker return to normalcy in Sri Lanka for Sri Lankans . We are hoping that a return to normalcy will lead to a rebound in domestic tourism . However , we are conscious that the economic depression resulting from this crisis will mean that disposable incomes will be low and domestic tourism will not be affordable to many .

This will encourage spending at these establishments , helping their recovery . We once again thank the Government , our health care professionals and security forces for their relentless effort in protecting Sri Lankans in this extraordinary time of crisis . THASL and our members are fully supportive of the ongoing measures being adopted by the Government . We are appreciative of the health and economic battles being fought by the Government on several fronts .

@@31803230 <h> Families of the disappeared : Two years of protests , what must they do next ? <p> The biggest protest I had ever participated in or seen in Kilinochchi took place last week . It was organised by the Tamil families of the disappeared , to mark two years of roadside protests and demanding information about loved ones who had disappeared . It was a gruelling march of more than six km that took over two hours , through the sprawling A9 road in Kilinochchi , braving extreme midday heat . <p> Perhaps , this pales in the context of the families having braved the sun , rain , dust , fumes , intimidation , threats and assaults for two years . Several elderly mothers collapsed during the march . But more died in the course of continuous protests , not knowing what happened to their loved ones . <p> Colombo <p> Colombo seemed indifferent . When one of the women leading the Kilinochchi protest called me , she had a clear request . She asked me to join them on February 25 , bringing the Sinhalese and English media , colleagues from Colombo and others from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was not much of a response . The protest coincided with the first year anniversary of the Office of Missing Persons ( OMP ) . <p> The OMP it had initiated inquiries and made interventions on some cases and referred to its primary mandate as being to ' Search and trace tens of thousands of missing and disappeared persons ' . <p> But the Office provided no information on the number of persons it had made progress searching for or specific progress made in a single case . Neither did it provide an assessment about progress made in implementing recommendations made in an interim report six months ago . In this context , it was not surprising to hear families of the disappeared protesting in Kilinochchi reiterating that they had no hope or confidence in the OMP . <p> One woman at the protest was clutching a letter sent by a previous Presidential Commission of Inquiry led by Maxwell Paranagama , which had functioned under President Mahinda Rajapaksa and President Maithripala Sirisena , The letter promised investigations , but the lady had not heard of any progress or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the OMP might end up doing as well . <p> Geneva <p> Geneva also seems indifferent . Last week , the UN Human Rights Council ( UNHRC ) started its 40th session , where it is due to review progress made by the Sri Lankan Government in terms of commitments made on accountability and reconciliation at the UN body three and half years ago . At the Kilinochchi protest , there were many references to the UN , demanding an increased role from it . The protesters recalled that resolution 34/1 of the UNHRC was due to inaction of the Sri Lankan Government on resolution 30/1 and commitments therein . <p> They demanded the UN to ' Stop giving Sri Lanka more time ' , instead to consider other options of ensuring reconciliation and accountability . But the first draft of a resolution on Sri Lanka to be adopted by the Council dated February 27 , two days after the Kilinochchi protest , had no reference to , nor reflected the spirit , grievances , aspirations and efforts made by families of the disappeared on the road continuously for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protesting families increased demands from the UN were not based on faith in the UN , but deep frustration and disappointment in the political leadership , and institutions such as the judiciary and the OMP . <p> Indeed , when I joined the same families at a similar protest on the 100th day of their continuous roadside protest , they blocked the A9 road for about five hours and their primary demand was to meet the President . The families also seem to have very little faith in Tamil politicians and insisted that Tamil politicians with access to the international community , donot represent them . <p> Hartal <p> A significant feature of the Kilinochchi protest last week was the hartal across the Northern Province . Shops , eateries , some supermarkets and banks were shuttered . There were no local buses and very few vehicles on the main roads . Hartals usually inconvenience the poor . Those who use public transport end up being stranded , daily wage earners lose their income . But my impression was that many joined the hartal sympathising and supporting the struggle of families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kilinochchi , Ammachi was closed , which meant loss of income . <p> I met some of the women at the protest , easily identifiable by their Ammachi t-shirts . After the protest , a shop keeper in Iranaipalei in the Mullaitivu District , about an hour 's drive away from the Kilinochchi protest , told me he could not go for the protest , but closed his shop in support of the protest . A trishaw driver who had stayed home in Mullaitivu expressed similar sentiments . Some of the female community leaders of the Kepapilavu community , themselves at a roadside protest for two years demanding release of military occupied land , also joined the Kilinochchi protest . <p> So did families of the disappeared , women 's activists , Christian clergy from across the North and the East . Many Tamil journalists from the North were covering the protest . Some Tamil politicians also joined , but played a low profile role , heeding the explicit demands from protest leaders that politicians should not be at the forefront of the demonstrations . <p> Reprisals <p> The day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habeas corpus cases in relation disappearances were being taken up in Jaffna courts , where a serving senior military officer is implicated . A female activist involved in the case had allegedly been assaulted and hospitalised last year and lawyers have allegedly been intimidated . <p> Even on this day , a lawyer was reportedly subject to intimidation as she was leaving courts after appearing in the case , with men on a motorbike trying to crash into her car . Last year had allegedly seen several incidents of reprisals against both Tamil and Sinhalese families of the disappeared . <p> Importance of solidarity <p> My visits and interactions with protesting families had led me to write about my experiences and reflections . The last two pieces I wrote to this paper on disappearances was about 366 days and then 500 days of the continued roadside protests . As I contemplated writing about the 730 days of the protests , I wondered what new things I could write . Not much seems to have changed , except continuing reprisals , increasing frustration and desperation . <p> The same lines with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my feelings today . <p> " As they wait for answers from the Government and institutions such as the OMP and judiciary about their loved ones , families of the disappeared deserve more coverage by mainstream Sinhalese and English media . They need continued solidarity from society - Sri Lankan and international . The struggle of the families must become a struggle of all Sri Lankans " . <p> The hartal showed that the North is listening and in solidarity with Tamil families of the disappeared . But Colombo ( and the rest of Sri Lanka ) and Geneva ( and the world ) does n't seem to be listening . What the families can do next remains a big question mark . 
@@31803231 <h> Youth Observer <h> SL Police go beyond their call of duty to fight Covid-19 <p> As the Covid 19 virus grips Sri Lanka , the country 's essential services have stepped up to fight in the frontlines against the pandemic . Among these is the Sri Lanka Police which has put its untiring efforts to curb the disease and its spread in the country . Nearly 55 000 Police Officers have been deployed islandwide to maintain law and order as the country faces one of the toughest challenges in recent times . But the nature of the pandemic has demanded the Police to go over and beyond its duties and the traditional role of policing . <p> According to Police spokesman SP Jaliya Senaratne , the Police considers the welfare of the public as its foremost priority at this crucial juncture . As a result since March 20 when an islandwide curfew was first declared the Police have been carrying out their duties under difficult circumstances . All leave and rest holidays have been cancelled for the 58,000 strong force due to the situation . Maintaining order during curfew has been one of the main duties as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning of the lockdown , various Police divisions and Police stations also took up more humanitarian efforts .

Despite their many responsibilities the Police in areas such as Colombo , Kandy , and Ratnapura did not forget to feed the starving street animals either . <p> Understanding that long term confinement in housing schemes can be distressing the Police band also visited these areas in Maradana , Dematagoda , Borella among others to not only create awareness about Covid 19 but also entertain and lift their spirits with music , a move which earned the commendation of the general public widely on social media . They have also been actively involved in disinfecting public spaces . Last week , street dwellers in Colombo were provided meals , disinfected , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the duties relating to combatting Covid 19 , the Police have also had to grapple with the increasing production of illicit liquor and other criminal activities during the time .

@@31803232 <h> Youth Observer <h> The pound of flesh outcry over the Sunil Ratnayake pardon <p> It 's entirely predictable that Army Sergeant Sunil Ratnayake 's pardon by the President in late March has provoked shrill protests in various quarters . The death sentence handed on the former soldier for what 's termed the Mirisuvil murders , was seen during the time of the former UNP administration as an act of post war score settling . Sri Lankan army soldiers were to be prosecuted in furtherance of post war ' reconciliation ' through prosecution , demanded in various quarters , which are too well know to deserve special mention here . <p> The venom with which various people want Sunil Ratnayake in jail for life -- they say the death sentence can be commuted -- is a disgrace . Here is one man , just one man , who was convicted for an alleged crime committed in the fog of war . There have been literally thousands or at least certainly hundreds of LTTE cadres released despite similar alleged atrocities against civilians . But yet , they want to extract from this one man , Shylock style , a pound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue and much of that can be dissected in the rest of this article . But as a preamble , this much has to be said . <p> One man can not be held hostage to the desire of various elements for a symbolic sacrifice that appeases everyone who wants to avenge alleged ' Sri Lankan military atrocities ' during the long years of hostilities . <p> There is no doubt about the symbolism . See all the petitions and the lengthy representations against the Presidential pardon . None of them fail to mention that with the Ratnayake sentencing , at least one soldier was convicted , adding in regret that in this rare case of conviction , the President has overruled the Court order . <p> Let 's consider the Court order later , but the important fact is that those protesting against the pardon are not interested in the conviction of Ratnayake per se , as much as they are interested in pursuing such a conviction as one that somehow validates their narrative of ' human rights violations by the army . ' <p> If Ratnayake , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfy them at least partially , because he symbolically represents a larger picture of ' atrocities . ' <p> But there have been no such atrocities . The Mannar mass graves tuned out to be a Portuguese era burial plot , ( enough said ) . But to have this one man hanged and if that can not be done , jailed for life , seems like a lifeline for that spurious narrative of wartime excesses . <p> CAUSE <p> But it 's typical . Atrocities did n't happen , but if they could symbolically extract that pound of flesh from that one man , their lust for the narrative seems appeased . <p> It 's so typical , because as usual , the protestors do n't think of human beings . They do n't think of one man , period . This man fought for peace against a virulent terrorist group . He has an impeccable record of combat in which he valiantly bore arms for the cause of ushering in peace , that we as Sri Lankans yearned for during a dark period of terror and mindless bloodletting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court judgement on that conviction to say the very least , leaves much to be desired . The Presidential pardon hence is not just desirable , but is a necessity -- in fact , a crying need . <p> But yet , they want to send this one man to jail for life . It 's typical because none of these elements have any sanctity for life , they are perennially in the cause of advancing their own projects . Lives , men , justice do n't come into the equation . Whether one man should be sent to jail for no just cause is something that does n't occur to them , when they do n't care about real people . They have a narrative they must vindicate , and that 's their project . <p> Sunil Ratnayake must be pardoned . The people voted for it , as the pardon was an election promise . Such a pardon is done in my name , and in the name of all others who walk free of terror today , due to the valiant services of this gallant soldier and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are too craven so much as to have their names mentioned here , have released tracts to the press saying that for his services to the country , it 's fitting that Ratnayake 's sentence be commuted from death by hanging , to life . <p> It beggars belief . Is there any more need to ascertain how craven these people are , when they think nothing of a life sentence and consider it a great favour when a warrior who was sentenced to death is put behind bars for the rest of his life ? The soulless nonchalance of such people is too bizarre even to contemplate . <p> Now , onto the legalities and the other ramifications of the Sunil Ratnayake case . The prosecution papers were filed in 2002 or thereabouts , but it is pertinent that the case meandered through the legal system until a conviction was secured in 2015 . <p> That was a very significant year . A new government had been voted into office , and owed its power to Tamil votes and other minority votes for the most part . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire prosecutorial process has to be launched to get to the bottom of a scheme of ' bend the law ' ( an IGP appointed in the era actually said that ) and subvert justice , in a project that was carried out in the duration of that administration . <p> This is not news , the witch hunts were a daily exercise , bordering on a cross between the hilarious and the wretched . These are established facts . One MP was caught on tape famously begging police officers and judges to frame political opponents . In one tape , the MP bizarrely told a police officer that they must coax some foreigner to claim falsely that Udaya Gammanpila , then an opposition MP , threatened him . Nothing was left to chance in this business of name and frame . Action is now being taken against the judges who were involved . <p> It 's in this atmosphere in 2015 that Ratnayake was convicted . It 's not to say for a moment that the judiciary or the judicial bench in that specific instance was compromised . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire prosecutions in that era were under a cloud , due to the aforesaid reasons . Again , there is not enough evidence at least that this writer possesses , to establish that the prosecution against Ratnayake was compromised or crooked . <p> But the point is , in an era in which prosecutions were under a cloud , this type of 2015 prosecution after a government determined to appease its Tamil voter base is returned to power , also comes under rubric of prosecutions that should be further scrutinized . <p> A lot of people , for good reason , do not trust the prosecutions of that era , especially when it comes to political and politically related hot-button issues such as the Ratnayake prosecution , period . <p> This is why a Presidential pardon is not at all remiss in this case ; a pardon was more or less imperative under the circumstances . <p> RECAP <p> It 's argued that even so the Supreme Court affirmed the High Court judgment . The Supreme Court did so on the basis of the prosecution 's case . At least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do under the circumstances , if the prosecution 's case is perchance skewed against the accused . <p> Then , there are the facts of the case , which some other writers have already alluded to elsewhere . But to recap briefly , there is no evidence whatsoever in the case record that Ratnayake personally slit the throats of the alleged victims . <p> In fact , the Supreme Court judgment notes : <p> ' The entire prosecution case hinges on Maheshwaran 's testimony . <p> This is a case where the court has to decide , mainly on circumstantial evidence . ' <p> Maheshwaran was the main witness , and he is supposed to have escaped the attack , that he says , was perpetrated by Ratnayake and four other men . But even he does not state anywhere in evidence that he saw Ratnayake himself slit the throats of the victims . Terrorists in civilian guise were in the habit of infiltrating the Mirisuvil area , with LTTE child soldiers in tow . The Supreme Court goes onto note that the crime could not have been committed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the NGO sector from saying that Sunil slit the throat of a five year old . <p> The fog of war element is not to be underestimated . Terrorists in civilian guise were in the habit of infiltrating the Mirisuvil area , with LTTE child soldiers in tow . The military police was under tremendous pressure from various supportive militias to implicate somebody in the army to keep civilian sprits up . The Supreme Court in judgment states the entire case hinges on one man 's testimony and circumstantial evidence , and yet proceeds to affirm the conviction . With all of the fog of war issues that this entails , such a conviction is not tenable , and a pardon is a must . <p> Besides , civil society which scarcely uttered a peep when a criminal Jude Shramantha Jayamaha was pardoned having been sentenced for murder in a crime of passion , says now that the pardon of a war hero in a flawed conviction was unforgivable . Simply stated , the less said about such civil society compassion , the better it is.

Dr.Shukri was more than just a scholar of Islam , he was a man of many facets who served as the director of an Islamic academic institution that produced some remarkable men , a mentor to a younger generation of scholars with a balanced view of religion and a livewire of various organisations to which he contributed immensely with his vast knowledge and experience . Men like him are very few indeed . <p> I first got to know Dr.Shukri as a Director of the First Global Group which I served as the editor of Islamic Finance Today magazine and of which he was a member of the editorial board . Despite all his achievements , he remained one of the simplest and humblest of men , the salt of the earth , so to say . I always wondered how one man could have contributed so much to the enhancement of knowledge and was also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributed to learned journals over the years had not reached the ordinary public . I convinced him to release these in the form of a book which I was only too glad to help him put together , The Mind 's Eye . Musings and Reflections of Dr. M.A.M . Shukri , a veritable treasury of knowledge from an Islamic perspective covering everything from archaeology and literature to human rights and the relationship between man and nature . <p> The extreme simplicity and yet at the same time the immense profundity he imparted to his writings always struck me as the work of a very high and sophisticated mind that knew how to present even the most complex arguments in the simplest possible language . If this proved one thing- it was his firm grasp of the topics he dealt with . Dr.Shukri had after all majored in Islamic Philosophy with a focus on the mystical Sufi treatise Qut Al Quloob for which he received his PhD from the University of Edinburgh following a Commonwealth Scholarship , no mean achievement for a man hailing from the southern town of Matara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shukri 's many facets . His most notable contribution to the community and the country was his role in the development of the Naleemiah Institute set up in Beruwala in 1973 by M.I.M. Naleem , a well meaning philanthropist who had come up with the brightest idea possible to enhance the quality of Muslim academia in the country . This was to set up a university cum seminary which would impart a sound and balanced Islamic education while at the same time equipping its graduates with secular professional knowledge in every possible area they chose to make a living of . The revolutionary idea of maintaining a balance between the Islamic life and the needs of the modern world attracted many young men to this hallowed institution . When they passed out , they did remarkably well as both Islamic scholars and professionals and to this day play a very prominent role in various government bodies and private organisations . <p> It was thanks to Dr.Shukri 's guidance as the Director of Naleemiah that it rose to its peak , attracting the most intelligent young men of the community as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from both here and overseas and gaining nationwide and worldwide recognition for its study courses . Not surprisingly he served in this capacity for nearly forty years , which itself speaks volumes of his contribution to this institution . It was also in this capacity that he convened a symposium of renowned historians to research on the history of the Muslim community of Sri Lanka at a time when there existed an immense void . The initiative led to one of the best books ever to document the history of the community- Muslims of Sri Lanka : Avenues to Antiquity . <p> Dr. Shukri also served in the boards of many other organisations including in the board of directors of the country 's pioneering Islamic outreach organisation , Centre for Islamic Studies where he played a very important role in its early years . The very presence of so distinguished a character in itself was sufficient to give a fillip to the many organisations he kindly consented to be in , greatly helping them to fulfil their purpose and mission . Such was the man . His charisma , knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew him . <p> May Almighty Allah have mercy on his soul and grant him Jennatul Firdaus. 
@@31854231 <h> Trump 's chaotic strategy is accelerating US losses <p> LONDON , May 23 . ( CNN ) - Europe outright rejected US President Donald Trump 's vision of the world this week . Tensions between these historic democratic allies that have been simmering since Trump came to office three years ago have now come to a boil during the coronavirus pandemic . <p> Covid-19 has shocked the world by the speed of its spread , but it is also accelerating another global change in the balance of power -- and not in America 's favor . <p> The extent of the divide became clear on Tuesday during a vote at the World Health Organization annual assembly in Geneva , Switzerland , backing Europe 's conciliatory approach to China relating to an investigation into the outbreak . <p> Power had visibly ebbed away from the United States as its demand for a tougher approach was dismissed , a move that should sound alarm bells in Washington . <p> Five months into 2020 and it already feels like a new era : now there is only BC and AC -- before and after coronavirus . <p> Suddenly the dynamics of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pandemic , sharpened by the complexity and urgency of the situation . <p> Chief among these is the perennial , three-way battle for dominance between the US , Europe and China . Despite Trump 's early hailing of Xi Jinping 's handling of the pandemic , he has since blamed the Chinese President for covering up the early stages of China 's outbreak . Beijing has consistently denied such accusations , and criticized the US approach to the pandemic . <p> Trump has also sought to blame the WHO for siding with China , and cut almost USD 500 million in funding to the United Nations body . He doubled down Monday telling the agency he will permanently pull US funding if it does not " commit to major substantive improvements in the next 30 days . " <p> Despite deep concerns about China 's handling of the pandemic , European leaders backed the WHO resolution calling for " a stepwise process of impartial independent and comprehensive evaluation , including using existing mechanisms , as appropriate to review experience gained and lessons learned " from the global response to Covid-19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China will atone appropriately for its early failures , but it is a measure of the gulf opening up between Trump and his European allies that such a compromise could even be countenanced . <p> Europe 's decision to reject Trump 's confrontation with China and the WHO will affect both parties vying to win this year 's US election . Regardless of who wins that race , Trump and his handling of Covid-19 are weakening America 's global leverage . <p> It also shows how much the rest of the democratic world has riding on the US election this year . Europe is best served by a world leader and trading partner that shares its democratic values . The WHO vote was a salutary reminder of where power goes when that 's not the case . <p> As far as most of Europe is concerned , Trump 's chaotic and vindictive response to Covid-19 has crystallized their deepest concerns that his administration is going where no right-minded democracy can follow . <p> Three years of " make do and mend " in the buckling transatlantic relationship is being pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sever the relationship but allows others like China to take advantage . <p> Trump 's comments about the value of ingesting bleach to combat coronavirus , that he later claimed were sarcastic , could perhaps at another time have been brushed off as yet another Trumpian moment . <p> These include his bullying of German Chancellor Angela Merkel in 2018 at NATO , or his tiff with Canada 's PM Justin Trudeau at the G8 in the same year in Vancouver . But now they just sound bizarre from this side of the Atlantic . <p> What can not be overlooked when assessing the White House , however , is his administration 's unambiguous ouster of critics , including four inspector generals this past month . It is not a play most democratic European leaders would countenance , or could get away with . <p> At this distance from the US , Trump 's handling of Covid-19 suggests a deteriorating grasp of the responsibilities of leadership , and certainly does not show an ally who can be counted on at a time of an emergency . <p> In their speeches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German Chancellor Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron , along with the meeting 's host , Swiss President Simonetta Sommaruga , took aim at Trump 's Covid-19 actions to cut funding for the world body . <p> The Swiss said we " ca n't expect a lot " from the WHO if " their funding is hit or miss , " while Merkel echoed the support for the WHO 's unity of purpose saying that " combating Covid-19 " can not be done alone . <p> Macron appeared to warn off Trump and Xi from withholding possible future vaccines : " human health can not be appropriated , brought or sold , " he said . <p> Notably Macron has been fighting a rearguard action with French pharma giant Sanofi after its CEO indicated the US might get access to any of his company 's potential vaccines before France , comments that Sanofi later said were " misinterpreted . " <p> International trust , never mind cooperation , is in short supply at the moment , and in the eyes of many Europeans , Trump is coming up short on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ill-advised comments , the latest claiming he was taking an unproven and possibly dangerous malaria medication as a Covid-19 prophylactic appear to leave European leaders little choice . They may not trust Xi , but they certainly do n't want Trump to dictate a strategy on the pandemic they believe will infuriate the Chinese Premier . <p> China is working on three of the world 's eight most hopeful vaccines as well as supplying personal protective equipment to many nations . <p> Although Xi has promised not to limit access , he increasingly believes Trump 's China strategy is to deny their hi-tech products access to world markets , an existential threat . The potential conflict of interests is obvious . <p> European leaders believe it 's better to coax Xi into cooperation than to confront him . <p> Their act of independence is of course a slap in the face for Trump and his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo 's efforts to divide the world into two binary camps , and follows in the wake of the bruising conflict over the provision of 5G technology . <p> In that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shunning the Chinese state-backed telecoms option , with threats to withhold intelligence briefings from those that disobeyed the order . <p> Yet with the US presidential election just over five months away , Europe 's decision ( and that of more than 120 other nations ) at this week 's WHO assembly is also a stark warning for America 's Democrats : lose in November and see Washington 's future influence in the world slip further over the horizon . <p> Four more years of Trump , on his current path , would seem unlikely to reset his post Covid-19 image . <p> But if Trump wins the argument , and Xi is dealt with by confrontation , then America loses twice . <p> First , it loses because Xi escapes investigation , wo n't admit any wrongdoing , and is unlikely to pay for his mistakes as Trump wants . Secondly Trump loses on the power stakes : Xi in essence , has dragged much of the world into his corner . That 's the Covid-19 effect shift in the power balance .

@@31857230 <h> International cricket stadium project -- will sanity prevail ? <p> Mahela Jayewardene has pointed out that at present Sri Lanka was not playing sufficient international or domestic cricket to warrant the colossal expenditure on another stadium . <p> by Javid Yusuf <p> The issue of whether parliamentary elections could be held any time soon in view of the public health situation has been engaging the attention of the public for the past few weeks . <p> The focus has now shifted to the Supreme Court with several Petitioners invoking the jurisdiction of the highest court in a bid to avert the looming Constitutional crisis that the country is likely to face . With the National Election Commission informing the Supreme Court that it will require a period ranging from nine to 11 weeks from the date the health authorities give the country a clean bill of health , to prepare for Elections , Sri Lanka is now faced with the possibility of being without a legislature for a minimum of at least six months . That may well be the case unless the President rescinds his proclamation of March 2 , 2020 dissolving Parliament , or in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> With the ball now well and truly in the court of the health authorities it is likely that they would prefer to err on the side of caution and be slow to give the green light for a parliamentary election , which can put many lives at risk . Sri Lanka may therefore have to resign herself to being governed only by executive fiat at least for the foreseeable future . <p> While these critical matters are engaging the attention of the highest judicial tribunal , comes the news of plans to build an international cricket stadium in Homagama , at the cost of 40 million US dollars with a capacity of 40,000 spectators . The move has come to light at a time when the country is grappling with an economic crisis and the Government is directing its attention to keeping the wheels of the economy moving . <p> With this in mind the Government is seeking to even curtail non-essential imports to leave sufficient funds available for the day-to-day running of the Government . In such a context , the idea of building an international cricket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only be described as obscene . World Cup winning Captain Arjuna Ranatunge has drawn attention to the fact that there are large number of people in the country struggling to get food on the table and said the first priority should be to help them . <p> Responding to public outrage as a result of the ill-timed proposal in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic , Sri Lanka Cricket ( SLC ) has said it will not utilise Government funds , and instead will rely on its own resources as well as ICC funding . The SLC also said the addition of such a stadium would boost the country 's bid to host future World Cup games . <p> The ICC Media Manager has however rebutted the claims about ICC funding and has said they are unaware of any plans on the part of SLC to build an international stadium . <p> The proposed international cricket stadium has also incurred the displeasure of Sri Lanka 's cricketing greats like Arjuna Ranatunge , Mahela Jayewardene and Roshan Mahanama all of whom have pointed out that the country has sufficient venues of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this point what is more important is to infuse funds to develop the cricket system than spend on costly projects . <p> Mahela Jayewardene has pointed out that at present Sri Lanka was not playing sufficient international or domestic cricket to warrant the colossal expenditure on another stadium . <p> The former Sri Lankan Captain has pointed out that Sri Lanka has hosted several international tournaments with the existing facilities and there was no real need to add to the venues available . Mahela Jayewardene has pointed out that the way to go would be to win a World Cup bid and thereafter build any new venues , if necessary , with ICC assistance . <p> SLC President Shammi Silva dismissed criticism of the stadium project by the former National cricketers . He said past cricketers did not know what was happening . <p> " Most of the past cricketers oare not involved with Sri Lanka Cricket administration and they do n't know what is happening . They think we are playing cricket only for 65 days a year . " <p> However SLC President 's views have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Match Referee in different parts of the World . Mahanama is reported to have said the following : " I have officiated World Cup matches the world over and only one cricket ground in New Zealand has a capacity of more than 40,000 fans . Even in other places like South Africa and England there are smaller stadiums in which World Cup games have been played . I am pretty certain the facilities we have at the moment are more than adequate , if we win a World Cup bid . " <p> SLC embarking on such a project at this point in time is somewhat difficult to understand in view of the " new normal " in sports being discussed the world over . The possibility of many sporting events needing to be restructured to take place in empty or half empty stadiums , at least in the near future , is an option being considered . Training methods are being tailored to suit the immediate COVID-19 pandemic health requirements that were put in place . <p> SLC itself has re-organised its training of cricketers in smaller groups to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medical Officer is closely supervising these sessions to ensure they conform with current health requirements . It would therefore seem that it is premature , at the least , to consider projects like a large International cricket stadium at this point of time . <p> The saving grace in this unfortunate drama is that there seems to be growing consensus across the political divide with regard to the inadvisability of what , in the current context , is another vanity project that is insensitive to the difficult circumstances the country faces . <p> Former Government parliamentarians Wimal Weerawansa , Udaya Gammanapila and Namal Rajapakse and former Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa , together with Arjuna Ranatunge , have all questioned the purpose of embarking on such a project at this point of time . <p> Gammanpila , who together with Weerawansa , had said the project would be funded by the ICC , later apologised saying he had been so informed by Minister Bandula Gunawardena . <p> " I unconditionally apologise for saying the proposed cricket ground would be financed by a grant from ICC having relied on the information given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tweet , while Weerawansa had said there were other priorities the Government should look into . <p> Minister Gunawardena and the local cricketing body had earlier said the country 's largest cricket stadium will be constructed in a 26-acre state land in Diyagama , Homagama which is Minister Gunawardena 's constituency . <p> Namal Rajapaksa too had tweeted as follows : " Infrastructure development is vital for any sport but this should not have been a priority at a time like this . " <p> Former Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa pointed out that a Government should not embark on such plans at a time when the country is facing a national emergency . Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa has now promised to consult senior cricketers before deciding on whether to give the go ahead for the project . If the current state of play is any indication it is unlikely the international cricket stadium project will get the green light , at present . <p> ( The writer is a one-time ambassador to Saudi Arabia .

@@31900239 <h> CBSL Reduces SRR to 2% <p> June , 16 , 2020 <p> The Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka , at its meeting held on 16 June 2020 , decided to reduce the Statutory Reserve Ratio ( SRR ) applicable on all rupee deposit liabilities of licensed commercial banks ( LCBs ) by 200 basis points to 2.00 per cent , with effect from the reserve maintenance period that commenced on 16 June 2020 .

@@31907233 <h> Youth Observer <h> Sales and marketing now , a unified operation <p> Marketing is the process of connecting and communicating with the customer at the initial stage of the buying process to make them aware of a product or a service . This process generates leads and produces prospects to the organisation . <p> On the other hand , selling is the process that proceeds further and manages the prospect through the subsequent stages until the sale is completed successfully . Changes in consumer behaviour that occurred recently due to the availability of the internet have caused the two processes to work flawlessly together to become more customer-centric . <p> Prior to the 1990s , the awareness of a product or service was communicated to customers through TV , newspaper , radio or magazines and outdoor advertising and promotions . The salesman was contacted to obtain further details . With the maturity of the internet , customers are no longer dependent on sales people to find details and use the internet first to find information . <p> The more pressing point is that customers can easily make comparisons . Data derived from the internet can be less biased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vast majority of customers take decisions without the need to talk to salespeople . Especially when purchasing online , they do not ever talk to salespeople . <p> In this new era , marketeers have recognised that they are compelled to redefine their role . They are moving away from the traditional function of sales support and focus on engaging in primary selling mechanisms . New salesmen realise that their own role must be reformulated to suit the prevailing situation . If they do not work with the marketing section hand-in-hand , they would be disconnecting from the source of new customers . <p> Sales and marketing functions were considered two separate skills until recently . Organisations recruited two sets of employees , mostly with separate managers to overlook the functions independently . In the new practical scenario , this will not be helpful any longer . The solution is to organise the business structure with the sales and marketing functions as a unified operation and place it under one person responsible for sales and marketing . Many successful Sri Lankan marketing companies have already made this change . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this operation holds , it is imperative that he or she understands the skills set of both functions . Thus , he will recognise that both functions are equally essential for business growth . The fact is that sales can not bring in revenue without leads and marketing can not create value without completing sales deals . Nevertheless , another fact that remains and need to be realised is that sales and marketing are separate functions and should not become blurred together . The interface between the two functions should be clearly defined and understood by the whole team . <p> Functions <p> In business , marketing is best placed to engage with the customer to create awareness and the sales team is considered best to engage the actual customer . Therefore , clarifying the functions of the two is vital for the organisation . <p> The task of marketing is primarily to provide information to create leads for the product or service . Unlike previously , today the ultimate goal is to provide contact information for the sales team to do the follow up . This is referred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sales is responsible for pursuing actual customers and closing deals . <p> However , in a small or medium sized organisation with limited budgets , the sales team is expected to network , call or prospect to generate leads by themselves as there are a large number of prospective customers who still prefer to do purchasing in the real world . <p> Although Sri Lankan organisations , particularly small and medium , are not yet adequately familiar with evolving sales and marketing methods , there has been an explosion in software and online tools to enhance efficiency . <p> There are software tools for appointment setting , video conferencing , webinars , desktop publishing and presentation to augment effectiveness . Among them , the most used program is customer relationship management ( CRM ) which contributes mostly to combine sales and marketing . <p> The basic function of these tools is to measure and manage step by step the stages of the sales process from lead generation to closure of a sale .

This monitoring process helps them to improve the quality of leads in the future . <p> Developing a lead generation campaign is an important task for any marketing organisation to maintain customer relationships . Through a campaign , the team can generate leads to be followed up by the sales team as unqualified leads . Usually , lead generation models are developed in several stages . Content development is the first . Well developed content which speaks of customer needs or their issues may result in a series of positive communications that will identify potential solutions . <p> The next step is to slice and dice the content to suit the different channels of communication and distribute to customers online . For example : social media , webinar , email or online advertising content must be ideally suited to the effectiveness of each channel of the mix . Of the leads received , some of the prospects will want to know more . The team should offer more information to convert them . Finally , the leads received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up .

Traditionally , throughout history , only sales people were rewarded for performance through financial incentives and recognition . With the new trend , as marketing and sales teams work together , a new method should be devised to compensate the combined efforts . Companies adopt policies such as conventional cash commissions , annual incentives or bonus depending on the type of business . The internet has changed many things related not only to management , sales and marketing but also general day-to-day life . Digital media has disrupted how information is created , distributed and used . Therefore , the role of a salesperson has altered greatly . The sales role has become more consultative and less transactional . The need to be more data driven and tech savvy has become important .

@@31907234 <h> In the magical wild jungles <p> It was certainly good news that the Government re-opened national parks on Monday ( 15 ) , to nature buffs and the public after being closed since late March due to the Covid-19 pandemic . The public visiting the parks have been advised to maintain strict health regulations . <p> Similarly , the Government has also focused on re-opening the country to foreign tourists as well as locals to strengthen the devastated tourism industry . The Government has advised that the opening of national parks should be done in a manner that would not harm the pristine environment and the wildlife . <p> However , what I saw in a recently telecast TV documentary was heart rending . It showed a large quantity of animal flesh which had been seized by the officials of the Department of Wildlife Conservation during a sudden operation in Yala Block I. It clearly highlighted that illegal activities were being carried out unabated in the national parks , greedy hunters , fishermen , treasure hunters and timber fellers making national parks their haven during the lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic . <p> June is very significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sri Lanka from India when the missionary bhikku Arahat Mahinda was sent by Emperor Ashoka to convey the Buddha 's message to his colleague , the Sri Lankan King , DevanampiyaTissa . <p> The bhikku , on arriving in the island 's wooded and rocky city of Missakapauva , came upon the king hunting deer in the royal hunting preserve . Stopping the king in his tracks , the bhikku spoke to him about the Buddha 's teachings -- which , among other concepts , emphasises the sanctity of all living beings . He also informed the king that all mammals , birds and other creatures should enjoy the same right to live in the land as his people . <p> Impressed by the bhikku 's words , the king converted to Buddhism . He also renounced the pleasure of the hunt and designated his hunting preserve as a sanctuary where animals and birds could roam free , being granted royal protection from hunters . This historic event was the start of the royal protection for all forms of animal life . Perhaps the religious fervour which gripped the ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reason , the theme of preservation has been carried through to the present day . <p> Tradition <p> Under the auspices of the Department of Wildlife Conservation , the country 's popular wildlife reserves such as Yala , UdaWalawe , Wilpattu , Wasgomuwa and Kumana continue this ancient tradition , allowing tourists to visit these animal sanctuaries and have the pleasure of watching a variety of wild animals in their natural habitat . <p> I have been fortunate to visit a few popular wildlife reserves around the country in recent years , sleeping under the stars mainly to explore archaeological sites in the jungles and secondly , to see the animal life . I was drawn to the jungles by my life-long love of the Buddhist heritage and natural beauty . Heritage and nature , so important to Sri Lanka , have been central in much of my work as a photographer and history buff and drew my attention to these jungles . <p> Ruhuna , more popularly known as Yala , arguably the best national park in the country is in the southeastern corner of the island . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the December rains , when the trees and grass were green and the tanks were full . <p> It provides visitors a great chance to see elephants . Sometime ago , spotting a leopard or sloth bear at Yala was only a remote possibility ; but in recent years these animals have increased in the park and are now frequently sighted . <p> Yala East National Park , popularly known as Kumana , lies in the East of Yala and is a paradise for bird watchers . It was one of my regular places to visit not only to spot animals , but also to venture along untrodden tracks to discover hidden wonders of the ancient civilisation dotting the jungle . A highlight here is the 200 hectare ' Kumana Villu ' , a mangrove swamp where during May and June a host of water birds such as herons , flamingos , egrets , painted storks , pelicans , spoonbills , white ibis , cormorants and even the rare black-necked storks may be seen . <p> Just south of the central hill country , the Uda Walawa National Park -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settlements -- is around the man-made Uda Walawa Reservoir . It is a wonderful place to see elephants as about 500 wild elephants live here in large herds . Other memorable features about Uda Walawe are the teak trees and the excellent bird watching , with the colourful bee-eaters and a variety of eagles being particularly enjoyable . They seemed to be everywhere . <p> My journey to Wasgomuwa National Park was fascinating . It is the only national park in Sri Lanka 's Central Province where you can see elephants in groups in their natural habitat . It is a wildlife photographer 's paradise . This park , bounded by two major rivers , the Mahaweli and Amban Ganga , was inhabited by people during the era of the ancient Sinhala kingdom . Irrigation canals and tanks ( wewas ) bear witness to the past prosperity but its present value lies in conserving 23 species of mammals , 143 varieties of birds and various amphibians , reptiles , butterflies and fish , as well as a rich diversity of plants . <p> If Wasgomuwa 's scenic beauty was impressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Park lies on the West Coast and is mainly thick secondary forest . One of the unique features of the topography of the park is the concentration of villus , basin-like natural tanks , where large flocks of water birds and herds of wild animals come to quench their thirst . These villus are also the home of crocodiles . <p> Kudriamalie Point <p> The park is also famous for its spotted leopards and sloth bears . Herds of deer , and sambhur ( elk ) in groups of twos and threes , could easily be seen in the park . Moreover , the ancient Kudriamalie Point lies in the western part of the park close to the coast and a number of archaeological sites are dotted within the jungles of Wilpattu . <p> As I drove back home visiting each national park , I looked back on great days sampling some of the best wilderness areas in the country . The authorities of the parks have a duty to protect the animals from human vultures who are always eyeing prey in the jungles .

@@31921231 <h> Youth Observer <h> Managing the media on the road to Nandikadal - Part 1 <p> The conflict with the terrorist LTTE dragged on for over two decades causing widespread death and destruction with no obvious end in sight . The Government , after the election of President Mahinda Rajapaksa , recognised , perhaps for the first time , that carefully managing the media , both domestic and international , was an important factor if this endless struggle were to be ended successfully . President Rajapaksa , a consummate politician , accepted the profound value of a non-antagonistic media and carefully orchestrated initiatives to secure this objective . As the world knows , the bloody conflict was eventually ended on the banks of the Nanthikadal Lagoon on May 18 , 2009 , through the colossal efforts and sacrifices of the security forces . <p> The lessons learned by the US military in Vietnam , and not lost on it in the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq , provided Sri Lankan Government policy makers invaluable insights in confronting the LTTE . <p> The strategies employed by the state during the last phase of the conflict to manage the media , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the LTTE , is an often overlooked aspect of Sri Lanka 's brutal conflict . Ensuring balance and the goodwill of the influential and opinion shaping media , to the extent possible , was a major challenge to the Government during this uncertain period , 2006 to 2009 May . <p> The international media had a direct impact on the thinking of ( and continues to do so ) decision makers in distant capitals which maintained a close interest in the intractable conflict largely due to the lobbying efforts of the influential Tamil expatriate community , interested NGOs and the counter lobbying efforts of the anti LTTE groups . <p> The LTTE expatriates and related NGOs often controlled critical vote banks and possessed substantial campaign contribution capabilities in their host countries . These assisted in their efforts to cultivate decision makers and their staff . <p> They were also mixing with a high degree of comfort in policy making circles in their host countries . It was essential for the Government to counter the efforts of the expatriate Tamil groups . <p> The Government 's media unit under Minister Keheliya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briefings mainly from the military perspective . <p> The Minister for Disaster Management and Human Rights also began hosting media conferences towards the end of the conflict . <p> His ministry was the peak Government body responsible for human rights and the supply of essential needs , especially food , to the areas under the control of the LTTE . <p> This made it the appropriate entity to address human rights and humanitarian issues . <p> As the conflict dragged on , and the tide of battle seemed to favour the military , raising human rights issues noisily became a clever part of the LTTE 's international strategy at a time when many committed human rights advocates were occupying positions of power and influence in Western countries . ( E.g. in the USA , the UK , Canada and many EU countries ) . <p> Some of these power brokers continue to wield influence in Western capitals and are likely to return to positions of greater power and influence should the liberal political leaders return to power . <p> The defence establishment and the police had their own spokesmen who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important as maintaining the morale of the population was an essential element as the campaign against the LTTE gained momentum . <p> Foreign Minister Rohitha Bogollagama also sought to make a contribution with ad hoc media engagements . <p> Uniquely , Sri Lanka continued to supply the essential needs of the civilians living in the territory controlled by a proscribed terrorist organisation and pay the wages of officials even though the Government was excluded from exercising any physical control over those areas under the terms of the Ceasefire Agreement of 2002 . This aspect of the conflict , which should have continued to be highlighted , is often missing in Western narratives relating to Sri Lanka 's struggle against the terrorist LTTE . <p> Balanced view <p> I was appointed as the Secretary General of the Secretariat for Coordinating the Peace Process ( SCOPP , Peace Secretariat ) in 2006 . Having spent 10 years as the head of the Treaty Section of the United Nations in New York , I had recognised the value of a sympathetic media which I had learned to use for the benefit of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretariat and , later , the Foreign Ministry were very quickly and methodically refocused to devise and implement a range of strategies to manage the domestic and international media , with a view to creating a more balanced image of the conflict internationally , especially to emphasise the efforts expended by the Rajapaksa Government to end the conflict in a peaceful manner and the care with which civilian needs were addressed . <p> However , the challenge was immense . I was appointed the Foreign Secretary in January 2007 . <p> Having read endless articles on the subject , the critical role of the media in influencing the outcome of the Vietnam War was etched in my mind and Sri Lanka could not afford to ignore those lessons as it confronted the LTTE . <p> Diverse views and perceptions relating to Sri Lanka 's long drawn out conflict were already entrenched internationally and it required a major effort to encourage the media representatives and their contacts to look at the conflict from a different perspective , and hopefully view the Government 's efforts to end the conflict and the care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathetically . <p> Early in his term of office , President Mahinda Rajapaksa was encouraged to meet the media personally , especially the local media , in a structured but informal manner as a confidence building measure between the Government and the journalists . <p> In his inimitable style and irresistible charm , he began hosting a breakfast for journalists every Wednesday morning . Usually these breakfasts , at the Presidential Secretariat , were well attended from across the board , including by those who were not too sympathetic to the Government or to Mahinda Rajapaksa personally . The food was plentiful . Senior officials were required to attend and chat about matters of media interest . <p> I had noted the Secretary-General of the United Nations , Ban Kimoon , occasionally hosting a breakfast for journalists during my time at the UN and I had chatted to the President of the value of such interactions . It was during one of these early breakfast gatherings that the editor of the Tamil newspaper Suderoli quietly informed the President that the LTTE was warning Kohona to keep off the media for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order extra security for me . But , for my part , I was incentivised to seek more opportunities to interact with the media even more aggressively . <p> Networks of contacts <p> Many international journalists were well established in Colombo by 2006 and had their own networks of contacts , including within the security establishment . Some of them ( and certain NGOs ) may well have been engaged in intelligence gathering and also influencing local opinion . What I noticed on assuming the position of Secretary General of the SCOPP , was that the NGO community ( both local and international ) and the aggressive domestic peace lobby ( who spoke English comfortably ) had close links , including socially , with the international journalists while the vast majority of Sri Lankans who viewed the conflict from a different angle , the monks , the teachers , the villagers , the common folk , et al , did not . Senior Government officials also lacked the confidence to interact with the international media . <p> Language skills were the critical factor . Consequently , what got reported ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views of the English speaking elite of Colombo . President Rajapaksa was very keen to rectify this imbalance through greater and more sophisticated interaction with the media and he repeatedly encouraged his senior staff to become active . I supported him strongly . But the problem was to deploy enough capable people for the purpose . <p> Political arm <p> The Tamil National Alliance ( TNA ) , which generally reflected the LTTE objectives and approach to the conflict and had been identified by many as the political arm of the LTTE , also had ready access to the international media largely because of the ability to communicate in English . It also had ready access to Western embassies . The international media and Western embassies had easy access to each other . <p> The TNA 's political goals were clear and they sought to use the international media and the international community to attain them in parallel with the LTTE 's bloody terrorist campaign . ( " The time has now come for all the Tamil political forces in the northeast to unite under one banner to give full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle , " the leader of the TNA , R.Sampanthan had said . ) The TNA had successfully cultivated the image of the representative of an oppressed minority . It was clear that a convincing counter narrative had to be developed by the Government . <p> A serious drawback facing the Government of Mahinda Rajapaksa at this stage was the resulting imbalance in the perceptions created in the international media over two decades which made it difficult to rectify the dominant image in distant capitals of a Sinhala Buddhist dominated Government in Colombo using the brute force of its armed forces to thwart the just aspirations of the minority Tamil people . <p> The horrendous reign of terror unleashed by the LTTE that caused the deaths of untold numbers of civilian non-combatants ( among the Sinhala and Muslim communities ) , including monks , caught in roadside bomb blasts , the massacres in temples and mosques , the destruction of public buildings , buses and trains , again involving the deaths of hundreds , the elimination of political opponents , the recruitment of thousands of children as combatants , ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned , have accused the LTTE of conscripting Tamil children orphaned by the tsunami ) the murder of national leaders , including in India , faded into background whispers and were never given the same prominence in the reporting emanating from Colombo , while all alleged infractions of the Government military featured prominently in prestigious journals with a negative commentary . <p> It is also instructive that Western missions in Colombo , except Australia , shied away from specifically naming the LTTE as a perpetrator while condemning terrorist attacks on civilians . <p> Too revealing <p> Some journalists , especially a couple of locals covering Sri Lanka on behalf of international media chains had developed excellent contacts domestically , especially within the security forces . Some of the reporting perhaps was too revealing and should have been controlled by the state . <p> In many other countries , the Official Secrets laws would have been brought to bear on them . Iqbal Athas , writing to the Sunday Times , was one of those persistent investigative journalists with excellent sources . <p> His reporting made riveting reading on Sunday mornings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York at the time . I once noticed a slightly blurred mechanism in the background of a photograph that he published of the LTTE that looked suspiciously like a multi-barrelled rocket launcher , a Katyusha , and I told him so in an email . In fact , it turned out to be an early acquisition of this deadly weapon by the LTTE . <p> The question that bothered me was whether these journalists had any responsibility to assist the Government in its campaign against a banned terrorist organisation or was it simply a matter of providing information that the Western clients wanted . I had also noticed during my time at NY that the US media had solidly backed President Bush 's invasion of Iraq despite serious issues of legality being raised around the world . To my surprise , most Western media representatives based in Colombo had almost a reverential attitude to the LTTE and its invincibility , developed over the years . <p> They were regularly briefed by their own missions who promoted the manthra of the LTTE 's invincibility and the only solution to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the LTTE 's invincibility pervaded certain elements of the political establishment in Colombo as well . As described by General Kamal Guneratna in his magnum opus , Rana Maga Osse , " Minister Moragoda who had been trying to convince General Guneratna to give up a forward position at the request of the LTTE , had bluntly declared that the Army could never defeat the LTTE . General Guneratna , in his book , quoted Moragoda as having told him that the Army could never win this war . <p> He had declared that although , the Army had waged war for about 20 years , it could n't bring the war to a successful conclusion . As the Army could n't achieve success , in the future , the Government was going ahead with negotiations " . Elements of the academia seemed to be convinced of this position also . The terrorism specialist working in Singapore , Dr Rohan Guneratna , endorsed Moragoda 's view that the LTTE could n't be defeated . In the aftermath of the conflict , he had switched allegiance to the war-winning government . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news agency had quoted Gunaratne online as having said that Sri Lanka 's war could n't be won by either side " . <p> The western media also lapped up the information published in the LTTE media outlet , the Tamil Net , without much effort to verify authenticity . The fact that a story appeared in the Tamil Net was adequate for them to wire it off to their head offices without fact checking . This had a telescopic effect . A story published in the Tamil Net would be repeated by major Western media outlets datelined Colombo and soon acquire the status of incontrovertible fact and placed the Government in an awkward position repeatedly . Amazingly , even the Chinese media , without adequate resident representation in Colombo , readily picked up the Western media stories . This was a major challenge confronting the Government raising issues of its own credibility . When a family of Tamils was killed in Mannar , the Western media relying on a Tamil Net report , immediately assumed that it was the Sri Lankan Army that was responsible . A quick response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an investigation initiated by the Peace Secretariat seemed to suggest that this was not necessarily the only conclusion to be drawn as the security forces had not been in the area and had no reason for killing the family . <p> Subsequent inquiries initiated by the Peace Secretariat seemed to indicate that the photos of the dead bodies had appeared on the Tamil Net almost immediately after the killings and had been distributed to the international media . It was possible that someone else was responsible for the killings , but the security forces were being blamed . It was in situations like this that the Government was required to respond quickly if not to be damned by a harshly critical press and , for this purpose , an appropriate mechanism was established in the Peace Secretariat and later in the Foreign Ministry simply to ensure that the facts were disseminated . <p> Similarly , when father Thiruchchelvam Nihal Jim Brown , a Catholic priest , went missing in Jaffna in 2006 , the Peace Secretariat followed up the matter , obtaining relevant information from concerned Government offices to respond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances of his disappearance were never clearly established , but the blame was sought to be pinned on the security forces . <p> The same Western media frenzy that followed almost every Tamil Net accusation of wrong doing by the security forces was not evident when the LTTE bombed a bus carrying villagers at Kebilithigollawa in mid June 2006 , including expectant mothers going to the weekly clinic . Over 60 in the bus were killed and many were seriously injured . <p> A mass burial for the killed was held and was attended by President Mahinda Rajapaksa . I also distinctly recall a senior minister of the Government gingerly slipping away although he had been asked by the President to deal with the media and asking me to front up to the cameras following the Kebilithigollawa bombing .

Rohinton Mistry , A Fine Balance <p> By the time this article is published , the results of the much awaited , and indeed much debated general election would have been held and the results known .

There were also warnings against voting for geriatrics ; crooks of all shapes and charlatans intent on charming an unsuspecting and oftentimes gullible proletariat . <p> Of course , almost all the election promises were to make the lot of the downtrodden better . Fundamentally the theme was economic prosperity which would offer a better deal in food , shelter , clothing and education based on Abraham Maslow 's foundation of the hierarchy of needs . Even if there were promises of fair play and justice , which is one of the essentials of good governance , it was not readily evidenced through the claims of the panjandrums who occupied the social media . <p> Whether or not justice is meted out with fairness and equity in a country is purely a subjective issue , but whether fairness in the administration of justice should be in an election manifesto of a candidate is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a fair judicial review should be guaranteed to the populace by any well-meaning statesman . <p> Judicial review is grounded on the administrative action taken in pursuance of implementing a law , rule or regulation . It is a truism that laws are adopted by the legislature whereas usually , rules and regulations are enforced by the executive on whom the legislature vests power and authority . This authority is used through administrative action and a leader elected through the democratic process should ensure that both administrative action and judicial review are applied through the rule of law . This essentially means that an elected leader should eschew arbitrary and capricious centralization of power . <p> Roscoe Pound , Dean of Harvard Law said in 1920 that genius of administrative action through commissions endangers the doctrine of the supremacy of law . Commissions established for purposes of administering rules pose one of the dangers of impairing the effectiveness of administrative law . In his book " Is Administrative Law Unlawful ? " Philip Hamburger , Professor of Law at Columbia University posits that the centralization of power which deviates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain insularity brought upon by bureaucratic ineptitude . It is hard to disagree with this premise as the centralization of power would in turn lead to creative inertia and the causal illusion that , in a so-called democracy , the system runs smoothly and justly . Often , this centralization of power leads to an erosion of the fundamental implementation of the process of administrative law which is enactment ( by the legislature ) ; execution ( by the executive ) and adjudication ( by the courts ) . <p> Leaders should be wary of the dangers of creating subordinate bodies such as commissions composed of unqualified and self-serving individuals . The creation of commissions more often than not vests power in inept and inefficient entities comprised of political appointees with partisan views and vested personal interests . The process suffocates democracy and the rule of law , making sycophants of the executive and the judiciary . It is interesting to inquire how this blatant subterfuge and disingenuous practice can erode the foundations of administrative law . <p> P.P. Craig , in his book Administrative Law states : " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shape of administrative law . It should never be forgotten that it is the legislature which enacts the policies which are directly constitutive of the administrative state . It will be the legislature which chooses whether these policies should be imbued with , for example , a market oriented neo liberal philosophy or one which is more social democratic in its orientation . In this sense , the shape and nature of administrative law will be profoundly affected by the philosophy which underlies government policy . The courts also have a major influence on the nature of the subject . They will decide what particular constraints to impose on administrative action , and more generally on the overall purpose of judicial review . Administrative law , when viewed this way , is always a combination of what is going on in the political world , combined with the reactions of the judiciary " . <p> What commissions do , as Dean Pound said in 1920 , is eliminate the supremacy of the law . In fact , eliminate the law in its totality , giving power to the executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do as she pleases , whether to sack a president and CEO of a company owned by the government , or dispense with a high government official , without giving that person recourse to the law . <p> At common law , which is applicable in England , there lies a remedy in judicial intervention if a government department promulgates advice in a public document that contained directions or advice erroneous in law . In such an instance , as was pronounced by Lord Bridge , in the 1986 Gillick case , although in general such non-statutory advice can not be questioned by judicial review , the exception to this general rule lay in instances where such advice was inconsistent with the law , where the courts could intervene . The judiciary could also interpret the meaning of codes , circulars and other similar documents , and review the interpretation of such documents by any government entity . There is also the issue of legitimate expectation of the victim of an administrative decision , towards such a decision being consistent with applicable law , and the courts can go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The courts could also inquire as to whether a decision had relevancy , purpose , reasonableness and was not taken as a result of or corollary to an abuse of discretion . Historically , common law courts have reviewed and exerted control over discretion exercised by public bodies , tribunals and agencies with a view to preventing misuse or abuse of discretion . <p> The Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Regulations of Canada has stated : " " When Parliament confers a power to make regulations , the regulation-maker usually exercises this power by drafting the text of the regulation to be enacted . The regulation-maker may also decide that the contents of an existing document are what should be used in the regulation it intends to enact . One way to make the contents of such a document part of the text of the regulation would be to reproduce it word for word in the regulation . Alternatively , the regulation-maker can simply refer to the title of the document in the regulation . The contents of the document will then be said to be " incorporated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to write the words of the incorporated document into the regulation just as if it had actually been reproduced word for word . The incorporation by reference of an existing document is no more than a drafting technique , and a regulation-maker need not be granted any specific power in order to resort to this technique . This is referred to as " closed " or " static " incorporation by reference . <p> At the apex of judicial review are the courts which are the ultimate arbiters of the administration of justice in a democracy . In the 1803 seminal case of Marbury v. Madison in the United States , three basic principles of judicial review were upheld . They were : it is the duty of the courts to pronounce what the law is and to interpret it and inquire whether a law has violated the basic tenets of the Constitution of the country ; decisions of the Supreme Court are the final authority on the status and interpretation of the Constitution ; and decisions of the Supreme Court are the final word on the Constitution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the handing down of the Marbury decision ) in the case of Cooper v.

However close to home , my life is influenced by my mother who was an eternally positive entrepreneur , and increasingly now her brother Upali of Kandos fame who broke all myths and barriers to become an outstanding entrepreneur in Asia at a time that Sri Lanka faced intense economic challenges including global trade barriers during his time . It was inspiring for me to hear first hand during my visits to Malaysia that even in the present day , after over 35 years , the general public in Malaysia recall Upali 's achievements . <p> QHow do you relax ? <p> It 's ironic that working under tremendous time and results pressure is the most relaxing and pleasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on a fantastic holiday .

Nelson Mandela , Lee Kuan Yew are classic examples of such inspiration . Doing things differently carries the risk of ruffling feathers and raising controversial matters to the surface .

@@32011237 <h> China Is Saudi Arabia 's and Iran 's New Friend -- and That 's a Real Problem for Israel <p> Beijing is working on a strategic collaboration with Tehran and is supporting a nuclear program in Saudi Arabia , which Israel ca n't afford to keep ignoring <p> by Yossi Melman <p> The multiplicity of crises , from political to economic to coronavirus-related , is distracting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Benny Gantz from an important shift in the Middle East , which has major implications for Israel 's security . Namely : China 's moves in Iran and Saudi Arabia . <p> Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman <p> When Netanyahu and Gantz talk about Iran , they dwell on the Iranian-Syrian axis and insist that the international community , especially the United States , should escalate the sanctions against the Islamic Republic . But this policy to which they and the entire Israeli defense establishment have been adhering becomes ever less relevant as indications mount that China is stepping up its involvement in Iran and Saudi Arabia . This has been happening as the United States weakens and also because U.S. President Donald Trump does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East malaise , mainly because the U.S. does n't need Arab oil as badly as it used to , and because he is n't committed to maintaining an American military presence in the region . This is also glaringly evident in Russia 's re-engagement with Syria and recently with Libya as well , and its sale of weapons to Egypt and Saudi Arabia . <p> But China is n't strengthening only as a corollary of America 's declining global status . It also stems from China 's far-seeing strategy and long-term vision aimed to gain it the pole position as the world 's greatest power . <p> In June , Iran approved a draft agreement for a 25-year strategic collaboration with China on economic and security-related issues , worth about $600 billion ( $17 billion a year ) . Under the agreement , Iran will sell oil to the Chinese at a discount , in exchange for which it will receive priority for Chinese investments in initiatives involving banking , transportation , energy , communications and technology . Russia is also working on a similar strategic 20-year treaty with Iran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the Chinese-Iranian plan to form a joint commission for developing weapons and scientific collaborations , including in cyberwarfare , as part of a Chinese move to step up its intelligence and military presence in the entire Middle East , including in Israel . Further evidence of its aspirations is the military exercise it held in the Indian Ocean in late 2019 with the Russian and Iranian navies . <p> It bears stressing that it remains unclear whether the Iranian-Chinese agreement will be signed , because Beijing has hinted that it is not pleased with Iranian leaks about the treaty . <p> When it comes to Saudi Arabia , Israeli should be equally worried , since the developments we 're seeing are unprecedented . <p> Jerusalem and Riyadh share a common denominator in their opposition to the Iranian nuclear program , Iran 's aspirations for hegemony in the Middle East ( expanding into Yemen , Syria , Iraq and Lebanon ) and also in their hostility towards Hezbollah . <p> Saudi Arabia has long been anticipating that Israel will launch a serious attack against Iran and damage its nuclear program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Second Lebanon War in 2006 , when Saudi Arabia " allowed " Israel to wage a protracted campaign without trying to mobilize the Arab countries against it , precisely so that Israel could deal Hezbollah a mortal blow . When that did n't happen , Riyadh was keenly disappointed . <p> According to foreign reports , for years Saudi Arabia has been nurturing close ties with Israel in intelligence and technology , and in cybersecurity as well . These reports claim that for some three decades , Mossad chiefs have been meeting secretly with their Saudi counterparts and with other Saudi leaders . Israel neither denies nor confirms this . Saudi Arabi 's willingness -- or perhaps we should say their boldness -- in revealing a smidgen of these contacts was partly based on Israel 's image as a regional power and as the country with the strongest army in the Middle East . The Saudi desire to promote Israeli-Palestinian negotiations also bolstered ties between Riyadh and Jerusalem over the years . <p> But the absence of progress on the Palestinian front due to Netanyahu 's refusal to negotiate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as Israel 's domestic crises , have cracked Israel 's image . A Western intelligence source told me that he had heard his interlocutors -- senior Saudi intelligence officers -- expressing surprise at the feebleness Israel has demonstrated in recent years vis- ? -vis Hezbollah and Hamas . <p> " You have to decide which Israel you are , " said the source , citing the Saudis , " a strong Israel that defeats its enemies as in 1967 , or a country that is not only unable to defeat Hezbollah , but is also failing to defeat Hamas . " <p> This is the context in which we should therefore be seeing Saudi Arabia 's recent decision to accelerate its bid to acquire nuclear know-how and technology from China . Apparently Riyadh , under the leadership of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman , realized that if it wants to block Iran from developing nuclear weapons , its salvation wo n't come from Trump or Netanyahu ; and it may be signaling that it has also decided to embark on the nuclear road . <p> About a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a facility for extracting uranium yellowcake from the uranium ore mines in its territory , and that it built the facility with China 's help . Saudi Arabia stated years ago that if Iran develops nuclear weapons , it would too . About a year ago the brother of the Saudi crown prince , Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman , who also serves as the energy minister , said that his country wants to purchase knowhow in order to achieve control of all the components and stages of the nuclear process . In the past Saudi Arabia tried to purchase nuclear reactors for electricity generation , which would have also given it the knowhow , technology , equipment , materials and infrastructure for a potential military program . The United States was willing to accede to the request but conditioned it on a Saudi commitment not to build facilities for uranium enrichment . Riyadh refused . Israel maintained silence . <p> The Saudis know that if the U.S. does n't build the nuclear power reactors for them , Russia or China would be happy to do so . As its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arabia to want to diversify its energy sources and build nuclear reactors . The question is whether it will also build facilities to enrich uranium , and other sites to necessary to enhance the nuclear program . In that connection China is a familiar supplier for Saudi Arabia , having sold it long-range missiles in the past . Another optional supplier would be its ally Pakistan , which has nuclear weapons . <p> A battle over resources <p> China 's ability and willingness to engage in strategic cooperation with two enemies , at the same time , is the behavior of a superpower . For years it was widely assumed that the Chinese interest in playing on the global field ( on all the continents and in all the arenas ) originated in its desire to control the sources of natural resources and to ship them , by sea and land , to fuel its economy . This economic interest is slowly but surely being augmented by Beijing 's understanding that economic strength and global clout must be backed by military might . <p> Even if Israel knows and understands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having difficulty formulating a reaction . One is mental paralysis regarding Iran and Syria ; an inability to realize that things can change . That , for example , is why Israel and the United States are insisting that the embargo on weapons sales to Iran ( which expires in October ) should continue . <p> But it probably wo n't , based on the positions of China , Russia and the European Union . Israel would do well to accept the fact that even if the embargo is maintained , Chinese involvement in the region is changing the rules of the game and requires fresh thought . The Iranian presence in Syria may turn out to be a minor problem for Israel compared to the Chinese-Iranian challenge . <p> The other problem is fear of China 's anger and Israel 's reluctance to harm its ties with Saudi Arabia . Israel has been tiptoeing on eggshells as the Chinese and Americans exchange blows in their trade war , but at some point Israel will have to take a side , and will have to decide which is the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face of it , the answer is clear , and when the day comes , Israel will be forced to denounce China 's nuclear assistance to Saudi Arabia , because the program poses serious danger to its national security . Crown Prince bin Salman will be peeved , of course , but if Israel stays mum , it is likely to find itself facing yet more entitities -- not to mention Jihadis -- playing with nuclear toys . <h> Sri Lanka Guardian <p> Get all latest content delivered straight to your inbox . <h> Subscribe Us <h> Random Posts <p> 3/random/post-list <h> LATEST UPDATES <p> 3/feature/post-list <h> ABOUT US <p> The Sri Lanka Guardian is an online web portal founded in August 2007 by a group of concerned Sri Lankan citizens including journalists , activists , academics and retired civil servants.Sri Lanka Guardian has registered as an online newspaper in Government of Sri Lanka .

@@32011238 <h> India : The border challenge <p> The PLA has blemished the Modi Govt 's muscular image created in the wake of Uri and Balakot responses against Pakistan , which won it an overwhelming political mandate <p> by Ashok K Mehta <p> One 's blood boils watching the way India and its Army are being pushed around by the Chinese People 's Liberation Army ( PLA ) along the Line of Actual Control ( LAC ) . Roughing up soldiers , intruding/transgressing on the Indian side of the LAC at will and violating border protocols have become second nature to the PLA . And yet , many citizens keep harping that when it comes to joining the battle , Indians are six feet tall . The PLA has no experience to fight in high-altitude terrain ; whereas Indian soldiers have been deployed in Sikkim , Ladakh and Siachen for decades . China lacks the regimental system of the Indian infantry and is composed mostly of short-term conscripts compared to India 's wholly volunteer Army . The PLA has not fought a war since 1979 . Neither have the Indian troops since the skirmish they fought " on our side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mixed bag of Pakistani frontier militia and hardcore terrorists at Kargil . <p> Because the PLA has done a sort of Kargil in east Ladakh , loud thinking can be heard about launching a land-air offensive a la Kargil , confined to our side of the LAC to vacate aggression in Ladakh . This comparison has many holes : It likens LAC to LoC , which is delineated with the maps exchanged in 1972 between the two militaries . The LoC is violated regularly by infiltration , cross-border firing and is a hot border . Not a shot has been fired along the LAC since 1975 and a no-shooting protocol exists . The Indian Air Force ( IAF ) has not carried out any joint military exercises for air support of ground troops along the LAC . Border protocols debar the use of force in settling the boundary question , which includes the LAC . <p> And yet , rogue actions of the PLA have continued periodically like the intrusions at Sumdorongchu ( 1988 ) , Depsang ( 2013 ) , Chumar ( 2014 ) , Doklam ( 2017 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ km . They have all gone unpunished . Instead , PLA raw recruits managed to thrash outnumbered Indian soldiers near the Pangong lake on May 17/18 last year so badly that 72 soldiers had to be hospitalised . PLA helicopters chased away an Indian helicopter in the same area around the same time . In short , India has been at the receiving end of PLA depredations except possibly at Galwan . The mystery is , why have Indian troops never done a tit-for-tat counter intrusion ? <p> That the disengagement and de-escalation process has ended in utter failure was recognised by the Indian Ministry of Defence ( MoD ) on its website earlier this month but the admission was pulled down within 48 hours . Indian forces have been left with buffer zones at friction points where they have had to withdraw and dismantle their fortifications from the Indian side of the LAC . Worse , the PLA is not permitting these soldiers to exercise their patrolling rights upto established patrolling points , which when connected , roughly align with the Indian LAC . <p> Still worse is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discuss the 18-km deep massive intrusion made in Depsang , a repeat of the intrusion in April 2013 , from where the PLA withdrew after three months . Crowning the multiple intrusions is the PLA 's construction of infrastructure on the Indian side of the LAC . Violative of border patrols , PLA activities are nothing short of acts of war . <p> Not only has China unilaterally changed the status quo but it has also shifted the LAC several kilometres westwards , attempting to conform to its 1960 claim line . It has also annexed several hundred kilometres of Indian territory . Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's in-denial statement of June 19 -- " neither has anyone intruded across our border nor is anyone intruding " -- has become the great enabler of PLA intrusions . Taking down the belated acceptance of intrusions on the MoD website is supportive of Beijing 's actions . <p> China is rejoicing that Modi has kept the Wuhan spirit alive whereas it is an abysmal failure of summitry . By virtually condoning the Galwan clash , Modi seems to have done the reverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Thagla ridge . <p> The joy and excitement exuded by Modi and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh over the arrival of five Rafales reflected the dire and option-less situation at the LAC . Given the phenomenal spike in the COVID-19 pandemic in India , a debilitating decline in the economy and the military overstretched on two fronts , a Kargil-like response to multiple intrusions will lead to a war that India can not afford . <p> India 's continental strategy ( if there is one ) for border management has come unstuck because the PLA has changed the rules of engagement , both on the ground and at the negotiating table . Five rounds of military commander talks , four rounds of Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination ( WMCC ) dialogue and conversations between high ranking Special Representatives on border talks have hit a cul-de-sac . <p> With wholesale intrusions in early May , China delivered an initial fait accompli . This was followed by a Chinese-scripted DPP in July end that made cosmetic disengagement to ease tensions at friction points but was tantamount to quarantining Indian soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand , dug down like it did at Doklam after disengagement and nobly proclaimed that disengagement is completed . This new fait accompli has imposed on India a new status quo without a hint of restoring the May 5 situation . <p> The Modi Government can pretend it is business as usual : Take down belated acceptance of intrusions from the MoD website , talk tough the virtues of Rafales and most of all , use diversionary strategies to focus on its spectacular political achievements like the grand ceremony at the Ram temple on the same day it erased Article 370 at Jammu &amp; Kashmir a year ago . <p> In deference to Chinese sentiment , the new status of Ladakh has been played down . The setback at LAC has almost disappeared from TV and media , reflecting India 's acceptance of aggression by the PLA . The tragedy playing out along the LAC for 10 weeks , that was essentially concealed by the Government , is a reminder of India 's colossal intelligence and operational failures . <p> It has blemished the Modi Government 's tough muscular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Pakistan , which won it an overwhelming political mandate . The Chinese PLA has changed that perception . That , too , 60 years after the 1962 war when China gave India a dressing down and withdrew unilaterally , vacating areas it now covets : Tawang and East Ladakh . India 's failure to shape and maintain a deterrent has led to the loss of face . <p> Three days from now , on August 15 , Independence Day , Modi will recount his Government 's achievements , including the handling of the pandemic . How he will frame the situation along the LAC , where the Chinese PLA has altered status quo and annexed Indian territory , will be worth watching out for . <p> ( The writer , a retired Major General , was Commander IPKF South , Sri Lanka and founder member of the Defence Planning Staff , currently the Integrated Defence Staff . ) <h> Sri Lanka Guardian <p> Get all latest content delivered straight to your inbox . <h> Subscribe Us <h> Random Posts <p> 3/random/post-list <h> LATEST UPDATES <p> 3/feature/post-list <h> ABOUT US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founded in August 2007 by a group of concerned Sri Lankan citizens including journalists , activists , academics and retired civil servants.Sri Lanka Guardian has registered as an online newspaper in Government of Sri Lanka .

Liberal democracy can not exist without a national identity that defines what citizens hold in common with one another . <p> Given the de facto multiculturalism of contemporary democracies , that identity needs to be civic or creedal . That is , it needs to be based on liberal political ideas that are accessible to people of different cultural backgrounds rather than on fixed characteristics such as race , ethnicity , or religion . " -- Francis Fukuyama . <p> Human beings have a fundamental need to belong -- a need that their collective identities , be it racial , ethnic , religious , regional , or national , would often satisfy . Such affiliations , which psychologists call " social identities , " serve multiple psychological functions .

This caused the social identity of a group of Sri Lankan 's to be ignored based on contested scientific evidence thus scarring the psyche of Sri Lankan Muslims for generations to come . At times , identities provide a sense of purpose and meaning and a basis for esteem and regard that is larger than people 's individual selves . <p> Identities efficiently satisfy the human need for respect and dignity . <p> The concept of " identity , " builds on a universal aspect of the human psyche that Plato labelled " thymos " , the demand for respect for one 's inner dignity .

Francis Fukuyama argues that identity politics is eroding national unity in the United States and Europe , undermining the kind of civil discourse essential to the maintenance of liberal democracy . <p> I believe that much of modern Islamism is similarly driven by identity confusion among Muslims in modernising societies who feel neither Western nor traditional and see a particular form of politicised religion as a source of community and identity . <p> We saw this in the movement which led to the Easter Carnage of 2019 in Sri Lanka . The ideological , political and social infrastructure which gave rise to the Easter Carnage is still not only existing but thriving in Sri Lanka thanks to identity politics of the majority and minority Muslim Community . <p> The prime reason for this situation is the current Sri Lankan constitution which calls for proportional representation at a threshold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persists the identity politics and all that it leads to will continue to persist and thrive in Sri Lanka . Politicians to clergy and all in between will exploit this situation for their individual expectations at the cost of national issues . <p> I believe that identity , in the recent past , has begun to focus on the rise of right-wing nationalist populism or vice versa . This development threatens liberal democracy because populist leaders seek to use the legitimacy they gain from democratic elections to undermine liberal institutions such as courts , the media , and impartial bureaucracies which minorities rely on for a sense of equity and all citizens rely <p> on for fair-play . <p> The contemporary Middle East , like the Balkans before it , is an extreme example of out-of-control identity politics and what ultimately happens to countries that do not invest in integrative national identities .

I conclude by once again quoting Fukuyama who warns that ' fragmenting into segments based on ever-narrower identities , threatening the possibility of deliberation and collective action by society as a whole ' . <p> If we go done the current path of identity based politics we in Sri Lanka are most likely to fulfil this prophecy . <p> People will never stop thinking about themselves and their societies in identity terms .

@@32027240 <h> President reminds top politicians and officials -- you are servants of the people - EDITORIAL <p> In a policy statement yesterday to the newly elected Parliament where the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna ( SLPP ) has a majority of almost two-thirds , President Gotabaya Rajapaksa made what most independent analysts saw as a calm thirty-minute speech that was an example of being humble in victory but clear cut and concise in what he and his Government hoped to do in the coming months and years . Apparently on the President 's direction there was little pump and pageantry , no 21 gun-salute or guard of honour or military parade , though the President himself is a retired army officer . But for the first time in more than 70 years the President wore coat and tie as he sat on the Speaker 's chair for the ceremonial opening policy statement . The last to do this was Sri Lanka 's first Governor General Sir Oliver Ernest Goonetilleke popularly known as OEG . Though it is not an important factor , opposition critics could point out that it was also not in keeping with hallowed national cultural practices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike appointed William Gopallawa as the Governor General and he also wore the national dress . In 1972 , when a Republican Constitution was enacted and Ceylon became Sri Lanka , Mr. Gopallawa was appointed as the President but only with ceremonial powers . Then in 1978 , J.R . Jayewardene whose United National Party ( UNP ) won a record five-sixth majority in Parliament , implemented the Executive Presidential Constitution on February 4 , 1978 . Since then President Ranasinghe Premadasa , President D.B. Wijetunga , President Mahinda Rajapaksa and President Maithripala Sirisena also wore the national dress while President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga , who was the Executive President from 1994 to 2005 , obviously could not wear the national dress and wore a saree . In yesterday 's policy statement , President Gotabaya Rajapaksa said that since winning the November 2019 elections with a record of more than 6.9 million votes , one of his great achievements was the curbing of the Covid-19 pandemic in Sri Lanka while highly developed countries like the United States were badly hit with the virus leaving millions dead or afflicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do this by enforcing strict health regulations including a three-month curfew or lockdown , closed all schools , making it compulsory for people to wear masks in public , maintain a physical space distancing of at least one metre and regularly wash their hands with soap before entering places where there were crowds and when they returned home . Unfortunately , while the President made his policy statement in Parliament yesterday , many of the members were not wearing masks but kept them on the table . After the President 's policy statement there was the traditional tea party attended by hundreds of people . Few if any of them wore masks . Politicians are known or notorious for preaching what they do not practice and making broken promises . We hope this will not be the case again because Gotabaya Rajapaksa received a record majority in the November 2019 Presidential Election and his party also won a record majority in the August 5 General Elections .

Jayewardene won a five-sixth majority in Parliament , the Sri Lanka Freedom Party ( SLFP ) -- the root from which the SLPP was formed -- had only a few seats in Parliament and the Post of Opposition Leader went to the Tamil United Liberation Front 's ( TULF ) Appapillai Amirthalingam . Yesterday the devastated UNP had no member in Parliament because the party has still not reached consensus on the solitary national list seat it received .

@@32032240 <h> The Right to Commit Suicide <p> The fundamental legal question would be whether life could be treated as just another object or commodity or possession that we have which we can dispose of as though we own it . <p> by Ruwantissa Abeyratne <p> Writing from Montreal <p> We hold these truths to be self-evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights , that among these are Life , Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness . <p> Declaration of Independence of The United States <p> In these difficult times , when a lethal virus is killing hundreds of thousands after inflicting untold suffering , it is possible that the issue of suicide would enter the minds of those who are the worst victims of COVID- 19 . Even otherwise , suicide remains a way of the world where statistics released by The World Health Organization show that " close to 800 000 people die due to suicide every year , which is one person every 40 seconds . Suicide is a global phenomenon and occurs throughout the lifespan " . <p> Recently , the alleged suicide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life seemed antithetical to his taking his own life , saddened me and confused and intrigued me at the same time . In a suicide note purported to have been written by him to his brother , the deceased says that he had no reason to go on living for many reasons . He was not old in the general sense believed by many - that old age starts at 65 . As far as I know , he enjoyed every minute of his life , besides having a relentless and inquiring intellect which he shared with us through his brilliant journalism . <p> His death remains with many an enigma , prompting some to question whether it was suicide . This question apart , I would like to inquire whether one has a right to dispose of one 's life at will or whether it is a matter for intervention by the State . In other words , if one survives a suicide attempt , can one be prosecuted for an offence or crime ? At the least , would a rational , reasonable , right thinking society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Albert Camus who once wrote in his penetrating work Myth of Sisyphus : " There is only one really serious philosophical problem , and that is suicide " . He went on : " I see many people die because they judge that life is not worth living . I see others paradoxically getting killed for the ideas or illusions that give them a reason for living ( what is called a reason for living is also an excellent reason for dying ) . I therefore conclude that the meaning of life is the most urgent of questions " At face value , this philosophy seems at variance with the Declaration of Independence quoted above , which says that the right to life is an inalienable right endowed by the Creator which therefore seemingly implies that only the creator can take life away from a person and therefore suicide or indeed assisted suicide is abhorrent to moral and religious tenets . <p> Clearly , if one believes that life is an inalienable right bestowed by one 's creator , an attempt at suicide , whether successful or not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the moral aspect , many erudite persons have pronounced their own takes . For instance , in ancient philosophy Cicero said ; " When a man 's circumstances contain a preponderance of things in accordance with nature , it is appropriate for him to remain alive ; when he possesses or sees in prospect a majority of the contrary things , it is appropriate for him to depart from life .... Even for the foolish , who are also miserable , it is appropriate for them to remain alive if they possess a predominance of those things which we pronounce to be in accordance with nature " . <p> Aristotle seemingly thought more lucidly when he said that taking one 's own life to avoid poverty or desire or pain is unmanly . or rather cowardly . <p> From a Christian point of view , St. Augustin quotes the 5th Commandment " thou shall not kill " to mean that the fact that the Commandment does not say " thou shall not kill thy neighbor " as in other Commandments which refers to one 's neighbor , ipso facto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Added credibility is found in the dictum of St. Thomas Aquinas as quoted in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy : " Suicide is contrary to natural self-love , whose aim is to preserve us . Suicide injures the community of which an individual is a part . Suicide violates our duty to God because God has given us life as a gift and in taking our lives we violate His right to determine the duration of our earthly existence " . <p> Carl Becker , a scholar on Buddhism focuses on the basic tenet of Buddhism which is anchored on " Chethana " or state of mind : " There is nothing intrinsically wrong with taking one 's own life , if not done in hate , anger , or fear . Equanimity or preparedness of mind is the main issue . The important consideration here is not whether the body lives or dies , but whether the mind can remain at peace and in harmony with itself ... the early Buddhist texts include many cases of suicide that the Buddha himself accepted or condoned . ... suicide is never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which determines the rightness or wrongness of the suicide situation " . <p> In an article in the journal The Conversation the approach of the Jewish religion is aligned to Christian philosophy when it says : " In the Jewish tradition , the prohibition against suicide originated in Genesis 9:5 , which says , " And for your lifeblood I will require a reckoning . " This means that humans are accountable to God for the choices they make . From this perspective , life belongs to God and is not yours to take " . <p> Jeyaram V. in Hinduwebsite.com speaks of the social stigma attached to suicide when he says : " Hinduism does not approve suicide . Suicide in a family brings social stigma and bad reputation to the family members , and they may have to live with that for long . It also raises many questions about the reputation of the family members and their possible complicity . Hence , many suicides in Hindu families go unreported " . In another learned essay elsewhere it is stated that murdering one 's own body is considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances it is considered acceptable to end one 's life by fasting . This practice , known as prayopavesha , requires so much time and will power that there is no danger of acting on an impulse . It also allows time for the individual to settle all worldly affairs , to ponder life and to draw close to God . " <p> With regard to the Islamic faith , it is reported that " like other Abrahamic religions , Islam views suicide strictly as sinful and detrimental to one 's spiritual journey . However , human beings are said to be liable to committing mistakes , thus , God forgives the sins and wipes them out if the individual is truly sincere in repentance , true to the causes and determined in intention " . <p> Finally , from the legal perspective , many jurisdictions have written into legislation that attempted suicide is a punishable crime , seemingly on the basis that one does not have the right to do away with one 's life or dispose of it as one pleases as though life were a property owned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law at Fordham University School of Law has quoted a 16th Century judicial dictum : " It is an unnatural violation of the rules of self-preservation , because a " right " to suicide is the " apparent contradiction in a claim of right to destroy the life from which all rights flow . " <p> All this having been said , the fundamental legal question would be whether life could be treated as just another object or commodity or possession that we have which we can dispose of as though we own it . To treat it as such we should have the three basic rights attached to ownership : the right to use ; enjoy ; and dispose of it at will . One way to think of the issue would be to evaluate the inconvenience , harm or loss that those left behind might suffer by a suicide . The defense would inevitably be " just cause " . As to what just cause would be is left to the moral judgment of the person concerned .

@@32040236 <h> Other <p> The Federation of Information Technology Industry Sri Lanka ( FITIS ) who has been the country 's representative body for ICT industry , that includes , software , hardware , IT education training and communication , recently submitted a proposal to the Ministry of Finance on the strategic development of the ICT industry in the country . The main purpose behind this proposal was FITIS 's mission of having it presented at this year 's budget . FITIS believed it would play a key role in lending a hand to the development of the ICT sector in Sri Lanka . FITIS focused on key initiatives to be adopted to enhance the ICT sector that included , the IT literacy rate to be increased to 75% by the year 2016 , Internet penetration to be increased by the year 2016 , 80,000 new employment opportunities to be created by the year 2016 and the ICT industry to achieve $ 1 billion export revenue mark by year 2016 from its current level of $ 600 million . FITIS also recommended making Hambantota as the emerging ICT trading hub of South Asia with enhanced aviation network and business/ tourist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Hambantota . This will also create over 3,000 new employment opportunities in the ICT sector in addition to maximising tourism potential in Southern Sri Lanka . Another recommendation by FITIS was that the software sector be recognised officially as an industry and a professional service . They also suggested that the current unit rate be adjusted , making the industry more competitive and resulting in greater software exports from Sri Lanka . The Government endorsed some of these views by proposing to develop an ICT Zone at Hambantota as the emerging ICT Hub of South Asia , capitalising on the newly built infrastructure such as the port , airport , expressway and the railway network , by promoting investments in this zone . Another area outlined by FITIS was to encourage genuine importers to enter the ICT market in Sri Lanka by discouraging smuggling and illegal imports and Improving the National Readiness Index ( NRI ) which is currently at a lower level due to violation of Intellectual Property ( IP ) rights and piracy issues etc . Speaking of challenges faced by the industry , FITIS Hardware Chapter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some IT related products are subjected to 12% VAT , 5% PAL AND 2% NBT . This has resulted in confusion , imbalance in the tax structure and the absence of a fair pricing policy amongst the imports with some of them charging VAT on bill whilst some of them did not . " It has also led to the birth of a flourishing black market which controls the majority of the sales in the market . Since these imports are not counted in international and local statistics it does not show the local market growth . Instead there has been a negative impact as black market sales increase , while genuine imports have reduced . It has also resulted in unknowing consumer buys and numerous bad experiences . Therefore we suggested that such items should be exempt from these taxes . " We are therefore extremely encouraged that the Government proposed to support this initiative by correcting the various anomalies in taxation pertaining to IT related items . The new Revenue Protection Order would provide a better classification for IT and related products under a single tariff band with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on hardware and software . " FITIS Chairman Thamarajah Suresh commented : " FITIS has always played the role of being a negotiating body representing the industry with the Government and working towards formulating and maintaining codes of conduct to encourage high standards of performance . " We are immensely motivated that our proposals have been accepted by the Government , which we believe will greatly contribute towards creating the right kind of awareness of the essential role played by the Sri Lankan ICT industry . We fully support the Government 's vision and will do our part in joining in their initiatives to help enhance our ICT industry to bring much needed revenue generation . "

The rest would say that they think th space scientists and got Dr. George Land , a leading expert in evaluating creative performances of humans , at the time , to develop a test for the purpose . Later , Dr. Land conducted a study of 1,600 five-year olds using the same concept and found that 98% of the children scored in the ' highly creative/creative genius ' range . <p> When the same children were tested five years later only 30% of them scored in the ' creative genius ' range . By the age of 15 this percentage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 25 only 2% of them got to that category . According to those findings , one might even say that our future was in our children 's hands . This , together with some of the other answers people give in similar surveys conducted around the world , can be used as supporting evidence to reaffirm the saying : " We are all born geniuses but the process of living de-geniuses us " . <p> When we consider this process of " de-geniusing " humans from birth to adulthood , we certainly will have to analyse our system of education since most humans from ages 3 to 18 get their knowledge and training while they are processed through these systems all over the world . Studies such as this clearly show that by the time we finish school we are much less creative than we were , going in .

Creative power , or creativity , of human beings was associated with spirituality until the middle of the twentieth century . <p> The Oxford dictionary defines creativity as : the use of skill and imagination to produce something new or to produce art .

It is also important to notice that the definition says : " the use of skill and imagination .... " . The word ' imagination ' would perhaps make it easier to understand that we should be somewhat creative since we can imagine things , as long as we are not ' brain-dead ' . If you can remember some of your dreams you would not have any trouble accepting the strength of your imagination and hence creativity too . <p> Creativity <p> Research shows that creativity , which is at the highest level at the age of five , diminishes gradually through the process of living .

Blaming the Sinhala-Buddhists has been the only ideological trick they had to seduce their people into the path of brutal and futile violence . <p> For instance , Prabhakaran was nurtured , encouraged , supported , financed and defended at all times by the Tamil Vellala elite which retained their grip on power in the peninsula by demonising the Sinhala-Buddhists . Prabhakaran knew nothing but the hate politics fed to him by the Tamil theoreticians / propagandists who manufactured a fake history of Tamils which invariably ended in projecting the Sinhala-Buddhists as the permanent enemies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was encapsulated in the Vadukoddai Resolution which declared war on the Sinhala-Buddhist in 1976 . <p> In the current political context of the post-Gotabaya Presidential election , the choice before the Tamils is either to go back to the Vadukoddai Resolution and kick-start the road to Nandikadal again , or carve out a more realistic path for peaceful co-existence taking into consideration the lessons learnt in Nandikadal . It is , indeed , sad that Wigneswaran has chosen to ignore the new realities haunting the Northern landscape . He has reverted to the same-old , same-old hate politics . He made use of the occasion to address the extremists who are likely to follow him into the never-never land of elusive Eelam . He talks of the ' right of self-determination ' , ' the right to be recognised as a nation ' , ' hegemonic dominance ' of the majority , ' the 1983 pogrom ' , a claim to be ' the first indigenous inhabitants of this country ' , and , of course , ' the oldest living language of this world . ' <p> Take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being the oldest , boosts only the egos of the Tamils who have nothing else to crow about in Sri Lanka . Besides , it is a specious argument because if antiquity is a mark of superiority then the Sinhalese language , which the Tamils say came into being only in the fifth century , should be considered superior to the English language which blossomed into what it is today , only in the 15th-16th centuries under Geoffrey Chaucer and modernised by Shakespeare later . <p> Besides , the Tamils of Jaffna did not create the Tamil language which , indeed , is a cultural gem . The local Tamils brought it in their bag and baggage when they crossed the Palk Strait in the 12th-13th centuries . Tamil historians have openly admitted that the Jaffna Tamils were merely second-hand imitators of Tamil Nadu culture . No original masterpieces ever came out of Jaffna . On the contrary , the Sinhalese created and gifted to the world a whole new language rich enough to express the subtle nuances of the greatest philosophy of India , Buddhism . As opposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they have been the virtual founders of the great Tamil culture that flourished in South India . Simply because Arumuka Navalar and C . W. Thamotherampillai excavated the neglected Tamil classical texts from South India and printed them in Jaffna they assume that they have been the virtual founders , discoverers , and revivalists of Tamil language and culture . <p> Creative genius <p> The fact is Jaffna had not contributed anything substantial to the greatness of the Tamil language . So which community can claim to be superior to the other ? Is it those who are parroting a language borrowed from another land ? Or those who with their creative genius minted a new language ? <p> The Sinhala-Buddhists also gave the world a new civilisation and a new culture . In fact , the great aesthetic savant , Ananda Coomaraswamy , wrote a classic monograph on Medieval Sinhala Art . <p> Being a Tamil , would n't he have written an equally great monograph on Jaffna art if the Tamils had anything comparable to that of the Sinhalese ? So what is Wigneswaran crowing about ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came from his father 's loins when its origins go way back in time to the dim distant past in another land ? In comparison let 's take the case of the American and the Australian migrants who took the English language with them as they migrated into new lands . <p> They do not bask in the supremacy and the glory of English language created in Britain . They take pride in the creative power of their own people who produced a new culture of their own demonstrating their innate genius . Can Wigneswaran at least point to the genius of the Jaffna Tamils comparable to that of the English migrants domiciled in America or Australia ? He may not be familiar with these two cultures . Can he , therefore , tell us in what respects the Jaffna Tamil culture -- not that of Tamil Nadu -- is superior to that of the Sinhalese ? <p> Then he talked about ' the first indigenous inhabitants of this country . ' This is another symptom of the common Tamil malaise to imagine histories that never happened . Their political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could justify their current political agenda to create a separate state . Vadukoddai Resolution ( 1976 ) is a typical example of the Tamil mytho-maniacs concocting a political manifesto to sustain and pursue their unattainable ' aspirations . ' <p> Besides , conflicting theories question the validity of their self-serving history which eventually led to the Vadukoddai Declaration of war in 1976 . <p> Political violence depends on the extent to which it is possible to manufacture hate politics , extremism and myths . As the primary aim of the Vadukoddai Resolution was to provide a valid justification to claim proprietary rights over Sri Lankan territory they went overboard by declaring the myth that they were the first arrivals . <p> This claim also makes them believe that they are superior to all other migrants who came later . Let us for the sake of argument concede that they came first . They must then explain why the inferior Sinhalese who came later built a unique civilisation , culture and language that stand to their glory surpassing all activities of the superior Tamils . Besides , if they came earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strip in the sands of the North ? Is n't it because the Tamils began their settlements , according to Tamil historians , only in the 12-13th centuries ? <p> Each time the Tamils claim that they are superior to all others in the island , they are forced to explain why they played such an inferior role in the history of the nation . For instance , if the Tamils are so superior to the Sinhalese and the Tamils played such a pivotal role in the national history how did the inferior Sinhalese come out on top dominating every inch of the way in history to the 21st century , overcoming all challenges they faced , mostly from the Dravidians of the North ? <p> Take , for instance , the simple issue of demographics . If they came first they had the field wide open for them , with no opposition , to populate and leave their indelible stamp on every conceivable aspect in history . But they did n't . They had Paskaralingams , Mahalingams , Panchalingams , and a whole lot of lingams none of whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dominate the historical landscape . So how did the Tamils fail and why did the Sinhalese succeed ? Recorded history states categorically that the Sinhalese were exceptional because they outstripped the Tamils in their historic journey through the ages gone by . <p> Throughout the better part of history , the Tamils lived under the shadow of Sinhala rulers . They accepted Sinhala as the official language with which to communicate , from royalty down to the common trader in Chekkhu Street . This also leads to a serious question : Does history belong to those who make spurious claims to justify the politics of the day or to those who made history with their blood , sweat and tears down the ages ? <p> Perspectives <p> In one of Wigneswaran 's sober moments he says that " we ( should ) shed the false historical perspectives of the past " . True . Absolutely true . But he has a motive for saying this . He wants the world to accept his narrative of events rejecting the one that contradicts his version . As in any other conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants the world to ' shed the false historical perspective ' that contradicts his narrative . In other words , like all Tamil partisans marketing their one-sided story to the world he is making a strong bid to hide the subhuman history of Jaffna that humiliated , persecuted , oppressed , suppressed and even massacred their own people on a mass scale for centuries under fascist Vellalaism . He is deliberately falsifying the historical perspectives of his past because the truth will blast his political myths to bits . He would , for instance , find it very difficult to give another example of the ruling class/caste denying their own people the right to walk in God-given sunlight . These outcasts were allowed to come out only at night declaring loudly as they walked that the Turumbas -- the lowest of low castes -- are coming , purely to warn the Vellalas to close their doors and windows to maintain the purity of their eyes . <p> So when he says , " we should shed the false historical perspective of the past " he should begin from his end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He should first examine critically and objectively how his forefathers treated their own people before he accuses the Sinhalese of discriminating against the Tamils , or denying them their dignity and rights . What dignity did his ancestors give the low-castes when they refused to open the doors of the Vellala-owned temples to the low-caste Hindus to worship their common God/gods ? Or kept the front pews of the Church to the high castes and the last rows to the low-castes ? In America the Negroes were not allowed to sit in the front rows in buses but only in the back seats . In the Vellala fiefdom the low-castes were not allowed to sit on any seat , front or back . <p> They had to sit on the floor of the bus . This was institutionalised discrimination that dehumanised Wigneswaran 's own people . He refuses to examine the horripilating tortures , persecutions , oppression and agonies of his own history . As a former judge it is his moral duty to weigh the available evidence before passing judgment . He should begin by asking : Why did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to each other and walk with dignity and pride as children " of Tamil homeland ? " <p> The debacle at Nandikadal must open the eyes of the Tamils to recognise that the Tamil leaders have been ' congenital idiots ' ( Prof. David Kumar ) . With all the accumulated knowledge gathered from their misadventure on the road to Nandikadal they must , at least , at this late stage , accept responsibility for their folly . Blaming the Sinhalese is not going to take them to their unattainable Eelam . <p> They must be more pragmatic and admit that it is ' the false historical perspective of the past ' that led the Tamil leadership to the self-destructive Vadkoddai Resolution . They were arrogant and intransigent political animals who led their people to a humiliating and disastrous end in Nandikadal . The rhetoric recycled by Wigneswaran can lead only to the next Nandikadal . Is this what the Tamils want ? <p> Lucid moments <p> Quite rightly he says , in one of his lucid moments , that we should " learn from our mistakes of the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all communities would feel equal to each other and walk with dignity and pride as children of Mother Lanka " . But here he is pointing his finger , as usual , at the Sinhalese . In saying this he is in denial . He is lying through his teeth . He is the living example of Tamils and Sinhalese ' walk(ing) with dignity and pride as children of Mother Lanka . ' He was given a free education at Royal College , the best school run by the ' Sinhala state ' . He was also given a free education at Law College run by ' the Sinhala state ' . ( In Chennai he would have had to pay through his nose to qualify as a lawyer ) . <p> He practised as a lawyer in the courts of ' the Sinhala state ' and not in any of the pseudo courts in de facto state run by his Tamil hero , Velupillai Prabhakaran . He rose to the highest rank as judge in ' the Sinhala state ' where he could walk with dignity and pride as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the dictates of his Tamil Thalaivar . <p> Above all , his daughter is married to a Sinhalese . Would he ever have given his loving daughter to a Sinhalese if he knew that she would not ' feel equal to each other and walk with dignity and pride as children of Mother Lanka ? ' So why is he painting the Sinhalese as the evil demons when he has , all his life , thrived and walked with dignity and pride as a child of Mother Lanka ? Besides , should he not think compassionately about his own people , who had suffered enough due to the folly of their leaders , and ask what chances he has of taking his people beyond the next Nandikadal with his kind of logic and rhetoric ? Wigneswaran is typical of the derelict , rudderless Tamil leader wandering in no-man 's land in the post-Prabhakaran period . With Prabhakaran the Tamils had a centre to hold them together , however obnoxious he was to the civilised world horrified by his fascist violence . With Prabhakaran they had something to lean on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacuum and they are running around like chooks without heads . Finding a new path that would not lead them to another Nandikadal is the task for the Tamil leadership . Threatening the nation with another round of Vadukoddai violence is counter-productive . But the rhetoric unleashed by Wigneswaran and his fellow-Vadukoddian , Ponnambalam , on the first two days in the new Parliament expose not only their obsession with the failed politics of the immediate past but also the bankruptcy of the Tamil leadership stuck at the cross-roads without a compass . <p> To go back to regain their political leverage by militarising and weaponising their separatist politics they have to find another Prabhakaran . Neither the ground realities of the post-Nandikadal period nor the international support for Prabhakaranist terrorism is there for them to go that far . Clearly , they have to find a more viable alternative . Ponnambalam spoke arrogantly of his ' two state theory ' as if nothing has happened since his grandfather sparked off the first communal riots in 1939 with anti-Sinhala rhetoric in Nawalapitiya . <p> For what it is worth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tamils to realise that they can no longer float forever in the dark clouds that thundered and drenched them with the blood of their own people at Nandikadal.

The result of this innovation was 35,000 yards of recycled polyester from 36,000 PET bottles from our own oceans in 2019 , and producing the 2019 Sri Lanka Cricket World Cup jersey with this groundbreaking fabric <p> Creating sustainable products involves addressing the evolving needs of consumers with products that are good for them . Insulated conductive wire woven into the fabric offers active heat technology that allows users to control their own personal micro-climate in countries with cold winters <p> Just a few years ago , sustainability was a nice thing to do -- the " right thing " to do . Whether it was creating sustainable workplace practices or developing sustainable energy solutions , businesses embarked on these efforts believing that it made a positive impact on its people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is essential for survival . Be it an individual , a business , a country , or the world -- embracing sustainable ways of working and living is non-negotiable . With elevated carbon emissions , melting ice caps , rising sea levels , and increasing incidents of wildfires , the trajectory of our impact on the world shows that deliberate , urgent action is critical . <p> The role and responsibility of makers <p> As manufacturing businesses , we have a responsibility not only to integrate sustainability into our own operations , but also to leverage our unique position as a trusted partner to influence brands and suppliers to change the way clothing is made , distributed and sold . Our consumer base has evolved tremendously over the last few decades into an educated and aware audience who are increasingly conscious of the social and environmental factors that influence our world . <p> As the makers of products , we have the ability to impact the suppliers and the brands we work with by influencing the process of value conversion from raw material to product . In this conversion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including ourselves as the makers of the product , as well as the brands , the supply chain , and of course the consumers . <p> Unlocking sustainable innovation <p> While innovating sustainable products is increasingly becoming a strategic move on the part of brands and manufacturers , there are several enablers that are required to unlock the true potential of this effort . To begin with , it must be integrated into the nucleus of the organisation 's thinking and strategy . Sustainable product strategy and design must go hand in hand ; one can not be exclusive of the other . Secondly , strong policies are needed to ensure that sustainability is not considered an ad-hoc effort but something that is integral to the organisation . <p> Investments are another important piece of this effort . At times , the return on investments may seem risky , or may not be immediate . During such times , leaders should be able to take that leap of faith , taking a calculated risk in order to create the change that you believe in . <p> The right mix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The talent that you attract should have the drive to create the change that the business believes in . This involves equipping the right talent with the right skill set , and motivating them through a bold vision , goals and the right incentives . When reward mechanisms are linked to performance , employees are intrinsically motivated to drive that change . <p> The final piece of the puzzle is culture ; we must consider how we would create the culture of innovation , sustainability and positive change right from the point of attracting talent into the organisation . A sustainability driven culture offers potential employees something that goes beyond traditional value such as reward , compensation , and other benefits . <p> It offers employees a larger purpose to believe in and feel connected to through values that are important to them as individuals . A company may talk about sustainability , but if it is not able to resonate with what motivates its employees , then the authenticity of the connection between employer and employee is lost . <p> Innovation : Where do we fail ? How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key enablers in place , sustainable innovation is still an area where most of us have seen or experienced setbacks . Significant challenges and opportunities that manufacturers face in this area relate to stakeholder alignment , scalability , maintaining quality , affordability , and building brand equity . <p> Getting the values of all stakeholders to coincide is indeed a challenge in driving sustainable innovation from an idea to a finished product . From the makers , to the suppliers , and the customer brands , if the commitment from all partners do not align , it creates a mismatch between priorities and can lead to bottlenecks or ultimately the failure of projects . <p> Scale also plays an important role . Big brands have the power to influence the scale at which we can approach sustainable innovation . Scale can drive margins , volume , and consistency , giving brands the power to take a strategic , long-term view to invest in sustainable products , and bring manufacturers and suppliers along on the journey . <p> Another element is ensuring that sustainable products perform as well or better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparel industry where we produce body contact garments , if the quality , hand feel , and performance of a recycled material is not up to par with a normal material , the product will not meet customer expectations . <p> Millennials and Gen Z-ers make up the segment that drives sustainable products and purpose-driven brands , but they are not able to afford a premium price . Therefore , the success of sustainable products depends greatly on their ability to remain affordable and provide the best value to the driving segment . With other consumer segments , a premium may be afforded only if the product creates real value and can offer a tangible differentiator in the market . <p> Another key element of success is the ability to further influence the consumer appetite for sustainable products through authentic storytelling . As makers and brands , we can build brand equity through honest messaging . We have seen how emotional , authentic stories have influenced the world , and this inspires us to build emotional value for our brands by openly sharing stories about topics that we and our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vs. competition <p> In the past , ' innovation ' has always had an element of mystery and discretion , and the race to be first has been of utmost importance . Claiming the intellectual property of a certain innovation has been the priority to gain that competitive advantage . So what does this mean for innovating sustainable products ? Where is the balance between securing competitive advantage and openly sharing technologies for the greater good of the world ? <p> When a product comes to life , there is an expectation of commercial return on the investments made in terms of technology , time , effort , skills , and intellectual property . But these need not be obstacles to creating shared value and unlocking true potential . If collaborators and stakeholders have a common objective , it is possible to find a collaborative space , which does not contradict the commercial value that we have to create . <p> Open innovation platforms allow partners to work together with due understanding , where the creator could get benefits such as being recognised as the first mover or receiving exclusivity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goals can enable productive ways to collaborate and innovate together , while also promoting a healthy level of competition . <p> What does the future hold ? <p> In the apparel industry , we have seen several prominent brands making commitments on sustainability before COVID-19 overtook the world . With the subsequent downturn in the industry , it seemed unlikely that the same commitments would remain in place as brands struggled to stay above water . <p> However , the reality has been the opposite . The uncertainty caused by the pandemic coupled with the resurgence of social justice movements across the globe has shined a spotlight on brands that stand for something greater than fashion or profit . The consumer appetite for sustainable products has increased and the level of aggression with which customers are driving sustainability within the industry has picked up exponentially . We 've seen that mindsets can change within hours and days , and while investments do n't unlock at the same pace , the extended ecosystem of manufacturers , suppliers , and other partners must plan strategically to avoid falling behind the curve . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shift has motivated all stakeholders to move with equal aggression and collaborate to drive the change demanded by the consumers . While this increased appetite is critical to moving ahead , we must also ensure that policies and guidelines are established to sustain this momentum as well as the investments and commitments made by all parties . <p> In terms of global apparel exports , Sri Lanka remains at about 1% contribution -- which leaves us with 99% opportunity . While there is so much more for us to do in establishing ourselves as a key player with a clear differentiator , as an industry , we have been committed to creating positive change in terms of our operations , people practices , and product innovation . Focusing on sustainable products is yet another lever that gives us the opportunity to establish our role as a key influencer who can revolutionise the way clothes are made , sold and worn . <p> The writer is the Chief Executive Officer of MAS Intimates , and a Board Member of MAS Capital and MAS Innovation .

" Firstly , we all bear witness to the modernisation of the country 's technology . This is an extremely important factor . Secondly , multiple parties have set aside differences and come together in accepting the national challenges of our power sector , " he said . The key target of increasing renewable power generation to 70% of the country 's capacity by 2030 and accompanying sub-targets pose several challenges to the country , from fair pricing and supply to protecting the environment . <p> However , Alahapperuma added that the Power Ministry was open to working with various parties to face these challenges and reach the target set by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa . <p> Secretary to the Power Ministry Wasantha Perera also shared her thoughts at the event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which resulted in the withdrawal of 6% of power generation led to the total collapse of the system . <p> " The slight abrasion led to the withdrawal of approximately 40% of the generation and , unfortunately , cascaded to a complete collapse of the power system of the country .

The microgrid concept could add stability and reliability to this system . <p> While officials of the Power Ministry understandably discussed the importance of the project to the country 's power sector , officials of the Education Ministry focused on the opportunities for innovation provided by the project . <p> Secretary to the Education Ministry Prof. Kapila C.K .

While he also spoke about reliability and sustainability playing a key role in this aspect , Education Minister Prof. G.L. Peiris went into greater detail about these two points . <p> " What this country has lacked for a long time is central planning . We have had a situation of drastic changes of policy between changes of government , but in a matter such as the generation of power , there has to be continuity , a long term plan , and consistency of application , " he said , adding that this was a way to instil confidence in investors and accomplish objectives . <p> Prof. Peiris explained the need for innovative thinking , not only in the power sector but in terms of local production as a whole , as strict restrictions on imports have led to a dire need for local production . <p> He added that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , remittances from the Middle East , and export income .

It is imperative then to closely examine the proposed 20th Amendment before it is voted upon in the Parliament . The Executive Presidency has been the bone of the contention since it was created in 1978 . All the elected Presidents since 1994 vowed to abolish the Executive Presidency with powers vested in it by the 1978 Constitution and transfer power to the democratically elected Parliament , but none had the political will to do so for reasons not unknown to the people .

Therefore , let the entire membership of the parliament appoint an Independent Constitutional Council comprising a majority of men and women of proven integrity from the society who will take care of drafting a new Constitution which ensures transparent democracy , the rule of law and the equality of all citizens . It is our view that rules need not be changed due to the vagaries and inconsistencies of individual prayers but to identify and elect or appoint suitable persons who will abide by the rules to safeguard truth , justice and the well-being of the country . It is the bounden-duty of the democratically elected Parliament to create wholesome governing structures capable of moving this country forward . The drafters must beware to plug the loopholes that lead to multiple interpretations . Greater clarity is needed if the Constitution is to serve the citizenry .

For the first time , it noted that it is " important to comprehensively understand the causes of the increase in COVID and prevent its recurrence .

The move prompted a Police spokesperson to declare that a special operation is under way to identify people who left the Western Province . They are to be quarantined in the places where they went to . It was a case of locking the stable doors after the horses have bolted . It is also pertinent to note that the move evoked laughter since those who left have not violated any law . They have , however , ignored an appeal from the Government to stay indoors .

The intelligence agencies have had a major role in contact tracing and conducting background checks on victims besides other tasks . The Sunday Times learnt that a thorough check on Brandix operations was conducted by them . Their findings , reported to President Rajapaksa , were extremely damning . The care provided to workers who complained of fever , at the initial stage , by a medical practitioner was only Panadol . They had to get back to work . It was only when a large number turned up with complaints of fever , sore throat and breathing difficulties , did the practitioner realise there was something radically wrong . Brandix , on the other hand , continued to deny the accusations and launched its own media campaign to claim all was well . Yet , there are a number of questions that remain unanswered . <p> It is in this backdrop that Attorney General Dappula de Livera asked the acting Police Chief , Chandana Wickremeratne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause of the COVID-19 explosion there . He did draw criticism in some quarters on the propriety of his directive . However , he firmly stood his ground . When he realised that some members of the Colombo Crimes Division ( CCD ) to whom the task of investigating was assigned were afflicted by COVID-19 , he urged Wickremeratne to also detail other personnel from Police units for the investigation . The fact that these investigations will be under the close eye of the Attorney General is noteworthy . <p> SURGE HITS PARLIAMENT <p> The unexpected surge in the COVID-19 pandemic was cause for concern for Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena . On Wednesday morning , he chaired a meeting of party leaders represented in Parliament . His first task was to announce that he had placed his assent on the 20th Amendment . It was now part of the Sri Lankan Constitution . <p> There was a lengthy discussion on the sudden spread of COVID-19 . Speaker Abeywardena said that a police officer assigned to Parliament had contracted COVID-19 . This was found out when he was in his barracks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleague to the Peliyagoda fish market to obtain fish for their mess . A test on him proved negative . There was also the case of a member of the kitchen staff who had died reportedly from a heart attack . Nevertheless , he said , checks were being conducted to ascertain whether he had any symptoms of COVID-19 . The Speaker also referred to the Sunday Times staffer covering Parliament testing positive to COVID-19 . <p> Party leaders discussed ways and means of enhancing preventive measures . They decided that in view of the risks involved , Parliament should meet only for one day on November 3 . This was to debate the recently gazetted medical regulations . It will be debated for three hours . Thereafter , the Parliament will meet on November 12 to take up the Appropriation Bill for 2020 . There will be a debate on this day on the appropriation of funds by President for three months after the presidential election . Parliament will follow the practice followed by the House of Commons in the United Kingdom by asking MPs who planned to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , if there is a vote , by prior arrangement , all MPs will be told to be present . The move will see a lot of empty benches . <p> A knotty issue for the party leaders is the mandatory requirement that the budget , to be presented on November 17 , is debated thereafter for 26 days . Seven days of this , according to Standing Orders , are devoted to the second reading and the remaining 19 days to the Committee stage . The debate will begin on December 11 . Here again , MPs wanting to make speeches will be called upon to do so whilst others can stay away until voting day . A decision is yet to be made on the period though most were in favour of pruning down the 26 days . The matter is expected to be discussed further at another meeting . <p> In the light of government medical institutions being overstretched , the party leaders endorsed Speaker Abeywardena 's proposal to have Parliament staff and employees tested at private institutions . <p> Despite the slumping popularity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is because the main opposition Samagi Jana Balavegaya ( SJB ) is still bogged down with its internecine problems . It has not been able to ensure the required checks and balances so that the deficiencies in the measures to counter COVID-19 could be more streamlined . However , the United National Party ( UNP ) which no longer has representation in Parliament expressed " grave concern " over what it called the Government 's delayed response in combatting the fresh outbreak of the pandemic . A statement said : " Despite repeated warnings of a pending second wave from the World Health Organisation , the Government chose to propagate the idea that it had defeated the virus , without taking adequate steps to protect the citizens of the country from a resurgence . " <p> The statement warned that " the recent breakdown of coronavirus mass testing will severely impact the government 's efforts to control the spread of the virus . Currently it takes over five days for the Government PCR tests to return the results . This delay has an impact on both the health and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the country . The unavailability of a testing machine will only further delay the results of the PCR tests being conducted in the country . It was the responsibility of the Government to have ensured adequate testing facilities were installed around the country to prevent delays . There is also concern regarding a pending shortage of hospital beds and ventilators . The Government must make all efforts to increase the capacity at the hospitals to accommodate patients from this second wave . The UNP urges the government to give full priority to the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak and uphold its duty of ensuring the health and safety of the citizens of the country . " <p> On the other hand , it would be incumbent upon government leaders to immediately examine the areas where there are fault lines and rectify them . One such instance is the widening credibility gap between the public and the Government . This calls for a change in the Government 's communications strategy . It has created more doubt and suspicion in the public mind than awareness .

Sections within the Government spoke in different voices about the visit whilst some opposition parties speculated that the Millennium Corporation Challenge compact ( MCC ) deal was to be signed . He was originally to have visited Sri Lanka on June 27 last year but planned protests , particularly by Wimal Weerawansa 's National Freedom Front ( NFF ) , then in the opposition , put paid to it . However , US officials then attributed the cancellation to " scheduling problems . " <p> The Sunday Times learnt that there was no specific discussion on the MCC , ACSA ( Acquisition and Cross Servicing Agreement ) and SOFA ( Status of Forces Agreement ) . Pompeo during his talks had referred to pending arrangements with the United States and declared that it was up to the Government to take decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministers , after talks with Pompeo , that he would not under any circumstances sign the MCC agreement.He has explained that it would be he government 's official position . <p> Upon arrival at the Bandaranaike International Airport , Pompeo wrote in the VIP visitors ' book , " I look forward to strengthening our partnership on security , economic growth , and democratic governance . Let 's work together for a free and open Indo-Pacific . " After an overnight stay at the Taj Samudra , he got down to his schedule . One was a meeting with President Gotabaya Rajapaksa . Prime Minister , Mahinda Rajapaksa , was scheduled to take part and official sources said he had confirmed it . However , he did not turn up and had explained the reasons . It is not immediately clear whether it was due to personal or other urgent commitments . The other was a meeting with Foreign Minister Dinesh Gunawardena . Thereafter , the duo met the media . <p> What Pompeo discussed both with President Rajapaksa and Foreign Minister Gunawardena mostly remains secret . However , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side made . First to highlights of official extracts of remarks made both by Pompeo and Gunawardena . <p> Mike Pompeo : " My overall message in both engagements was very clear : The United States seeks to strengthen our partnership with democratic , peaceful , prosperous , and fully sovereign Sri Lanka . Our new embassy , for instance , is nearing completion . It is a sign of our commitment to the country and to the people of Sri Lanka , and we of course spend a good deal of time talking about our cooperation in defeating the pandemic that came from Wuhan , China . <p> " We talked about this a great deal . We talked about our economic relationship , great American companies that are here today . Brands like Coke and Oracle and IBM are here certifying -- or excuse me , creating high-quality jobs . These American companies are the most reliable partners on the planet . They are accountable to the law , they are transparent , they are assets to the communities in which they operate . <p> " And as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consistently will attract even more American investment . Those principles are deeply consistent with Sri Lanka 's history , its heritage as the oldest democracy in Asia . <p> " We also had a wide-ranging discussion on our security cooperation which helps keep some of the world 's most vital sea lanes open , as the minister recognised , in addition to our joint training . Indeed , a strong , sovereign Sri Lanka is a powerful and strategic partner for the United States on the world stage . It can be a beacon for a free and open Indo-Pacific . Look , that is quite a contrast to what China seeks . We see from bad deals , violations of sovereignty and lawlessness on land and sea , that the Chinese Communist Party is a predator , and the United States comes in a different way . We come as a friend and as a partner . <p> " In his victory speech last year , President Rajapaksa stated that he is the president of all citizens , not of only those who voted for him . And as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counting on those words to hold true . We fully expect that Sri Lanka will fulfil its pledges to take meaningful , concrete steps to promote accountability , justice , and reconciliation . " <p> Dinesh Gunawardena : " As a sovereign , free , independent nation , Sri Lanka 's foreign policy will remain neutral , non-aligned , and friendly . Conscious of the opportunities and responsibilities that come with our strategic location , we see the importance of maintaining the freedom of navigation in our seas and airspace , also protecting sea lines of communication and the undersea cables . <p> " We believe all countries should adhere to and respect international law , including the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea . We share views on the potential multifaceted maritime cooperation with Sri Lanka is keen to progress . Secretary Pompeo 's visit and the discussions have further enhanced our warm and friendly relations . " <p> MODERATOR : We will now open the floor for questions from the media , and we request the local media to present their question.MODERATOR : Okay . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with VOA . <p> QUESTION : Why have you chosen to visit Sri Lanka at a time when the United States is going for elections ? Is the purpose of your visit to move Sri Lanka towards an Alliance against China ? The US is offset reaching influence by signing agreements like MCC , SOFA through the quad group in Sri Lanka . And also , you have imposed sanctions against present Army Commander one of our war heroes in our country Lieutenant General Shavendra Silva from entering the U.S.A , based on unverified information . What is the current status of that and did the government of Sri Lanka request you to reconsider the imposition of the travel ban on Lieutenant General Shavendra Silva in terms of Geneva resolution ? <p> A -- Mike Pompeo -- " In relation to the third question , it is a legal process in the United States ; we will always continue to review it . We want to make sure to get it technically , factually , and legally right . We will continue to do that . First question about timing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussed I was scheduled to come here previously that is because of world cause I was not able to make the stop here . Final question was about what we are trying to accomplish here . We want the people of Sri Lanka to have sovereignty , we want them to be successful , and we want to see sustainable development . We think the United States is a friend and partner who offers exactly that , we want that . We would like to share visions as democratic nations . <p> " We know these democracies have shared vision , free and open shipping lanes , the capacity to trade and travel wherever they want to go . These are visions that People of Sri Lanka share with the people of the United States . My visit today was to talk about these things to figure out good ways to continue to build and develop our relationships . The American private sector companies will see the opportunity and come and invest . Train Sri Lankans and build-up those communities too , those are the kinds of that America offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Chinese have a very different vision ; we want to make sure that the people of Sri Lanka have that capacity to execute their sovereign rights to remain to have the freedom to hold elections like the ones that you all held . Those are things that democracy works on together , those are the visions we share . That 's why I was excited to make it here today . " <p> QUESTION : " Thank you very much for giving this opportunity . My name is Chavika Gunasekara and I am representing ( inaudible ) News in Sri Lanka . <p> " My question is to you , Secretary of State , Mr. Pompeo : Why have you chosen to visit Sri Lanka at a time when the U.S. is going in for elections ? Is the purpose of your visit to move Sri Lanka towards an alliance against China ? I mean , is U.S. attempting to offset Beijing 's influence by signing new agreements like MCC , SOFA , through the Quad group in Sri Lanka ? <p> " And also , you all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the war heroes in our country , Lieutenant General Shavendra Silva , -- from entering United States of America based on independently unverified information . What is the current status on that ? And did the Government of Sri Lanka request you to reconsider the imposition of travel ban on Lieutenant General Shavendra Silva in terms of the Geneva resolution ? <p> SECRETARY POMPEO : " All right . Thank you . I think there were three questions there . The last one , look , it is a legal process in the United States . We will always continue to review it . We want to make sure we get it both technically , factually , and legally right . We will continue to do that . " ( The Sunday Times learnt the same position was taken up by Secretary Pompeo when the matter was raised during President Rajapaksa 's talks . Diplomatic sources said hence the travel ban to US by Lt Gen. Silva and his family will remain . ) <p> " I think your first question was about timing . The Foreign Minister reminded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here previously and events around the world caused me not to be able to make that stop here . This was a time when I was able to make it . <p> " Your final question was about what we are trying to accomplish here . We want the people of Sri Lanka to have sovereignty and independence . We want them to be successful . We want sustainable development for them . We think the United States , as a friend and partner , offers just exactly that , and we want that . Democratic nations always do , right ? We know that these democracies have a shared vision for free and open shipping lanes , the capacity to trade , for people to travel wherever they want to go . <p> " These are visions that the people of Sri Lanka share with the people of the United States . And so my visit today was to talk about those things , to figure out good ways that we can continue to build and develop our relationship so that American private sector companies will see the opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and build up those communities too . These are the kind of things that America offers . There is a different vision . The Chinese have a very different vision . <p> " We want to make sure that the people of Sri Lanka have the capacity to execute their sovereign rights to remain independent , to have the freedom to hold elections just like the ones that you all have held . Those are the things that democracies work on together . Those are the vision that we share . " <p> MODERATOR : Okay . And from the U.S. media , we go to Nike Ching with VOA . <p> QUESTION : Good day , Mr. Foreign Minister . Colombo is indeed a beautiful place , glad to be here . If I may ask , this is the first time in many years a U.S. secretary of state visits Sri Lanka . Do you welcome more U.S. presence in the region ? Is the ( inaudible ) U.S.-Sri Lanka relationship an irritant to Sri Lanka 's relationship with China ? <p> Dinesh Gunawardena : " Sri Lanka-US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , we are very happy that the Secretary of State thought to spend the anniversary with us . We have come forward with years of cooperation ; we also look forward to going to the future too . Sri Lanka is a neutral , nonaligned country committed to peace . On those principles we hope to continue with our relations with the United states and other countries . " <p> As Minister Dinesh Gunawardena says , the talks with Secretary Pompeo , both by the President and him , were both " frank , friendly and cordial . " However , in essence , the stark reality is simply two-fold . As is officially known now , it was to warn Sri Lanka about China . He accused the Communist Party of China of being a " predator " and warned that Sri Lanka was falling into a Chinese " debt trap . " <p> To Sri Lanka , though couched in harmonious diplomatic parlance , that the warning was on the issue of human rights was clear , when Pompeo called for leaving behind sectarianism and wished for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soundbite sought to cover the wider segment of the human rights canvas . His observation that they fully expect Sri Lanka to take meaningful , concrete steps to promote accountability , justice and reconciliation , has resonance in the United Nations Human Rights Council Geneva resolution ( 30/1 ) on Sri Lanka , initially spearheaded by the US in 2015 . <p> As is clear , the two warnings were unsolicited and gratuitous . <p> Pompeo further prescribed that Sri Lanka has also to do its part on the rule of law . Pompeo seemed to have seized Sri Lanka 's wish for enhanced US investment in a similar prescriptive manner by observing that attracting the current investments in this country come with good governance and transparency in policy . He was subtle in his rhetoric whilst stating that the choices are for the government of Sri Lanka to make . Does it mean coming on board MCC and SOFA ( Status of Forces Agreement ) or face the machinations of Geneva for Sri Lanka ? <p> All praise should go to President Gotabaya Rajapaksa for setting the record right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught in a debt trap .

During the two big elections , both held less than a year ago , minority communities seemed to be the enemies of the ' pohottuwa ' chaps who said that they wanted to make Paradise a great Sinhala nation once again . <p> The masses were fooled because the election results reflected that . The majority overwhelmingly voted for the ' pohottuwa ' at both elections and the other communities voted against them .

It was inserted into the 20th Amendment in Parliament despite the Minister 's categorical assurance to Opposition parliamentarians that , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would be brought to the Bill at committee stage . <p> However that may be , the 20th Amendment is a fait accompli . Questions have been asked by opposition parliamentarians as to whether this last minute inclusion of the amendment of Article 119 and Article 137 of the Constitution may lead to ' packing ' the Court with friendly appointments in order to minimise the possibility of potentially adverse court rulings . This allegation will only be proved or disproved as the case may be in the future . Speculation at this point is hardly advisable . <p> However , the concern thus raised should compel the President and his Government to be fully conscious of this fact when making appointments to the superior courts of record in pursuance of that amendment . That duty is all the more severe given that presidential power in making judicial appointments has now returned to the largely unfettered state of the 1978 Constitution , unlike under the 19th Amendment to the Constitution where the Constitutional Council acted as an intervening influence . <p> The one distinguishing factor is that the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in force . Even so , it is difficult if not impossible to envisage situations where presidential appointments may be constitutionally challenged for suitability . On the face of it , the proposal to increase judges of the superior courts had been pending for some time . Even under the previous Government , it had been announced that the number of judges of the Supreme Court will be increased to fifteen given the backlog of cases prevalent in the Court though no further steps were taken in this regard . <p> True , the problem of laws delays is an entrenched and detested part of the legal process . This is a problem that has been acknowledged by the judges themselves for decades . The " chronic delay and frustration " in a typical civil litigation was succinctly summed up by a onetime President of the Court of Appeal when , after analysing the case flow statistics , he pointed out that the system reflects " excessive judicial passivity in an adversarial , undisciplined legal procedure with limited availability of versatile alternatives to a protracted trial ... where the institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see address of Justice Ameer Ismail at the ceremonial sitting on his assumption as President , Court of Appeal , The Daily News , Tuesday , August 25 , 1998 ) <p> However , does increasing the number of judges of the superior courts suffice to address this problem ? The failure of courts to perform is not limited to appellate court judges . Instead , it is an endemic problem arising from the lowest levels of the court system to the highest , affecting the criminal justice system as much as civil litigation . There is little need to appoint further committees to look into why this is so . At least where delays in the criminal justice system is concerned , what remains one of the best reports of its kind , is the 2004 Report of a Committee Appointed to Recommend Amendments to the Practice and Procedure in Investigations and Courts . That Report must be taken out of whatever drawer that it is languishing and its recommendations implemented . <p> This Committee identified the absence of police officers at stages of the trial as key reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommendations propose the introduction of administrative measures requiring police officers to attend court on a compulsory basis , pointing out that police officers ' obtain leave and abstaining from court sighting inappropriate grounds ' which results in unnecessary disruption of court proceedings . It advocates strict magisterial supervision in investigations to be prescribed by statute and recommends that defence lawyers be allowed access to all statements recorded during the course of police investigations . <p> In regard to the judicial handling of the caseload , the Committee observed the breaks in the continuity of trials in the High Courts were a key factor for the delay and suggests that the names of judges who are appointed to the Court of Appeal are gazzetted and that they be required to conclude all partly heard cases in which the prosecution has concluded its case . Consequently , the ensuring of cases before the High Courts to be heard on a day-to-day basis is recommended as a matter of priority . <p> But even with the best of intentions , addressing laws delays alone will not be enough to address public confidence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judiciary is important . Regional and global standards on judicial accountability must be given heed to and the transparency of bodies such as the Judicial Service Commission ( JSC ) must be ensured . Codes of Ethics applicable to judicial officers and strictly enforced thereto dictate that while it is the role of judges to decide on disputes before them fairly and to deliver their judgments in accordance with the law and the evidence presented before them , judicial decorum must be of the highest importance . These are of the highest importance in Sri Lanka where our judiciary has been subjected to extreme turbulence . <p> Such reminders are more important than ever now , as the Constitution itself is returned to the 1978 constitutional ethos of ' one man , one power . Transparent systems of judicial discipline , whether of the subordinate courts or at the higher courts are yet outstanding . The political nature of the impeachment process applicable to judges of the higher courts is of historical record . We have seen all too well , the unfortunate consequences of subjecting judicial accountability to parliamentary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and conferences on the Rule of Law and the independence of the judiciary replete with the usual pontifications by Ministers and their acolytes .

This is another outcome of wrong policymaking by the country 's political authorities <p> Making coconuts disappear from retail outlets <p> Fresh coconuts have disappeared from most of the retail outlets in the country by last week . In some places , they are available but sold through the backdoor as if the traders are dealing in contraband . Worse , they are sold at prices ranging from Rs. 100 to 120 per nut . That is close to double the price set by the Government for average sized coconuts . <p> But the customers are treated to a double jeopardy here . Apart from the high prices , they get partly mature coconuts plucked before they reach full maturity . Hence , they do not get value for money because the cream content in those coconuts is much less . <p> Since almost all the coconuts have been harvested before the due time , there wo n't be coconuts to be harvested at least for another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the dismay of housewives who use coconut cream abundantly in local curries . <p> Overreaction to price increases <p> What has happened to the coconut market in the country ? This is another outcome of wrong policymaking by the country 's political authorities . When coconut prices started going up due to the short supply , the Government overreacted by imposing a set of controlled prices on coconuts based on their sizes . According to some Government authorities who made the announcement , the objective was to protect the consumers who were going to be exploited by the opportunistic middlemen in the market . <p> In the first few weeks , fresh coconuts were available at the controlled prices at Government-run retail shops like the Lak Sathosa and major supermarkets . When the supply dried out soon , coconuts in those places too disappeared . At that stage , the consumers were served only by small grocery shops but at prices above the controlled price . <p> When the authorities started threatening to sue them , coconuts on the front side of the shops quickly disappeared . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to known customers . Even then , after treating them to a barrage of excuses that they too get them from the distributors at the same prices . <p> Cultivating coconuts without going for scientific methods <p> For centuries , coconut had been a tree of multiple use or in Sinhala , Kapruka , in Sri Lanka . Its main product , fresh coconuts , provided the cream for curries without which the local cuisine was tasteless . The edible oil it produced too was used as the base for many indigenous medicines . Yet , coconut was grown only in home-gardens without much care or tending . <p> When Dutch Governor Van de Graaf tried to persuade the local inhabitants to use scientific farming to improve the yields of both paddy and coconuts , he was not received very kindly by them . This changed to some extent in the British period when Sri Lanka 's newly-rich locals chose to invest their surplus earnings in commercial coconut plantations in Gampaha , Puttalam and Kurunegala Districts . However , they were absentee landlords who visited the coconut plantations very infrequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not receive the due attention from its owners . <p> Coconut , the political weapon <p> Coconut was such an essential ingredient in local cuisine that its price increases caused much anger among housewives . Then , this was used as a political weapon by Opposition parties to attack the Government in power . Thus , to arouse the wrath of voters against the Government , politicians of all hues used to bring ' half a coconut ' to political rallies and tell the people that that is what their Government has delivered to them . As a result , those in Government get nervous when coconut prices start rising in the market mainly due to short supplies . <p> In the past , consumers were appeased by importing coconuts from abroad . But partly due to disruption to international trade emanating from the COVID-19 pandemic and partly due to lack of foreign exchange to import coconuts , in the present price hike , the Government decided to impose price controls rather than importing coconuts from abroad . <p> But this should not have happened since the Coconut Research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the year that coconut output was to fall drastically in 2020 . In fact , CRI 's prognostication had been fairly accurate since , in the first eight months of 2020 , coconut output has declined by about 12% . Hence , had the Government listened to CRI at the beginning of the year , it would have averted the present fiasco in the coconut market . <p> Coconut is the main calorie source <p> As mentioned earlier , rice and curry are Sri Lanka 's staple diet and curries are cooked with an exuberant use of coconut cream extracted from scraped fresh coconuts . <p> Accordingly , about 65 to 70% of the country 's coconut production is used for household consumption . With this high consumption , the per head consumption of coconuts in fresh nut form has been very high at about 90 to 110 nuts per annum throughout the post-independence period . This has remained at this high level , despite the adverse publicity given to coconut fats since 1970s as a potential cause for heart diseases on account of the high saturated fat content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the daily calorie requirement of a typical Sri Lankan is obtained through the consumption of coconut fats , much higher than the calories obtained by consuming fish , meat and milk amounting only to a very small share of 5% . <p> A coconut index might show a marginal decline in people 's prosperity since independence <p> Hence , with increase in population , the demand for fresh coconuts for household consumption too has increased , while the production had remained almost static around 2,800 million nuts in recent periods . The result was the gradual increase in the price of coconut in the market offering a powerful political weapon for all opposition parties to attack the governments in power . <p> In 1948 , the price of a coconut was just a little lower than 10 cents . In 2020 , it has gone up to Rs. 120 , recording a staggering increase of some 120,000% in coconut prices in the post-independence period . It is pertinent to note that with the per capita income in 1950 , a Sri Lankan could have bought 5,350 coconuts . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capita income in 2020 , he could buy only 5,200 coconuts . Thus , in terms of coconut index , the prosperity of Sri Lankans has marginally declined . <p> Global change in coconut consumption <p> During the last 70-year period , there has been a tremendous change in the global coconut industry but not in Sri Lanka . <p> Malaysia , which was a major coconut producer in the 1950s , made a strategic change in its policy in 1970s when it foresaw an imminent change in the global consumption pattern in edible plant fats . <p> This occurred when the US farmers switched to edible oil plant cultivation like soy beans , sun flowers , corns and peanuts after their cotton farms were hit by the polyester revolution of 1970s . Almost simultaneously with this development , the world became more conscious of ' healthy hearts ' and it was claimed that coconuts contained a high quantity of saturated fats that contributed to elevate blood cholesterol levels raising the risk of heart disease . As a result , consumer preferences began to shift , logically or illogically , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Sri Lanka has killed the palm oil industry <p> When this development was taking place in the major coconut consuming countries , Malaysia decided to convert its old coconut plantations to palm oil plantations . It was driven by the fact that palm oil had an inflexible demand because it was not only an edible oil , but also an industrial oil . Today , Malaysia is the largest supplier of palm oil to the world market , sending its palm oil in tankers like the crude oil tankers , while coconut oil exporters are still using barrels to export their product . <p> Sri Lanka too started producing palm oil in a small way in early 1990s . The industry began to grow with new investments in palm oil plantations and associated factories to extract oil . However , due to the objections made by some groups against palm oil plantations , the present Government has decided to kill the palm oil industry altogether . With that short-sighted strategy , Sri Lanka has lost another chance to diversify its agriculture on modern lines . <p> New research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the research done in the Philippines , Indonesia and Thailand to raise the yield of their coconut plantations so that the higher productivity would lower the average costs enabling the coconut sector to survive in a fiercely competitive market . <p> Sri Lanka just managed to raise its yield level from 4,000 nuts per hectare in the 1950s to 7,000 nuts per hectare in the early 2000s . But today , it has declined to 6,000 nuts per hectare . With proper and regular manuring and irrigation , supported by improved plant materials , a coconut tree today can produce a little more than 100 nuts a year . <p> In Sri Lanka , fertiliser application has been the lowest priority of coconut cultivators . Since it takes about three years for manuring to produce good results , fertiliser applied today will bring in a better output only after three years . As such , Sri Lanka produces about 40 nuts per tree . But its competitors have moved in the opposite direction . They have increased their yields manifold in the last few decades . <p> For instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; recently it unveiled a new coconut variety that could produce 15,000 nuts per hectare . Even India , which ventured into coconut cultivation recently , has maintained a yield level , on average , of 8200 nuts per hectare with Tamil Nadu state reaching a record level of 13,000 nuts and Andhra Pradesh 14,000 nuts per hectare . Thailand has upgraded itself to producing 11,000 nuts per hectare , while Indonesia has reached a level of 15,000 nuts per hectare . <p> The Latin American countries have been the real winners in this race . From a very low yield level five decades ago , they have surpassed even the Andhra Pradesh State in India . Given this situation , Sri Lanka appears to be fighting a losing war with respect to yield improvement in coconut industry . <p> Dwarf coconuts to maximise yield and address labour issues <p> The third development is the breeding of the dwarf coconut tree to address the issue of labour shortage and late flowering of trees . The plucking of coconuts from dwarf trees is easier than plucking from traditional tall trees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the traditional tall trees take about five years for flowering , but the dwarf trees take only three-and-a-half years . <p> These changes made in the cultivation practices and policies by other coconut producing countries have enabled them to compete effectively with rival edible oils that had captured the global edible oil markets . <p> Sri Lanka has been a laggard in this area . <p> Sri Lanka 's past interventions in the coconut industry <p> To the credit of Sri Lanka , the country has in fact spent a vast amount of resources for the development of the coconut sector since independence . These measures include the establishment of the Coconut Research Institute or CRI as early as 1951 , introduction of fertiliser subsidy schemes , free distribution of newly developed planting material , introduction of coconut to new regions of the country and the establishment of the Coconut Development Authority in 1971 for the promotion and regulation of the coconut sector . The most recent intervention by the Government in the coconut sector has been the new loan scheme , titled Kapruka Ayojana Scheme , to help coconut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> There is a basic shortcoming in all these measures . They are all activities carried out in isolation without considering the developments taking place in other coconut producing countries or the global market for edible oils . <p> In the current context , development initiatives undertaken by governments are targeted to attain a single objective : management of governmental activities for attaining development results or MfDR that strives to create the intended impact in the economy or the sector . Government initiatives are praised not based on the activities they have completed but based on the impact they have created . <p> An important factor which the coconut sector should take into account is the impact of climate changes on the sector 's long-term development . <p> Two researchers attached to the International Water Management Institute in Sri Lanka , namely , Nishadi Eriyagama and Vladimir Smakhtin , in a paper presented to the National Conference on Water , Food Security and Climate Change in Sri Lanka in 2009 , have reviewed the available evidence on the subject and concluded that " the science community in Sri Lanka has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already changed " . According to the evidence quoted , during 1961-90 , Sri Lanka 's mean air temperature has increased by 0.016 ? C per year and the mean annual rainfall has decreased by 144 mm ( or 7% ) compared to the period 1931-60 . <p> The two researchers have projected that by 2100 , the country 's mean temperature will rise between 2.5 ? C and 2.9 ? C over the mean temperature in the baseline period 1961-90 and there will be changes in the quantity and spatial distribution of rainfall as well . Quoting a study done by T.S.G Peiris and others in 2004 , the two researchers have suggested that these climate changes would reduce coconut yields significantly making Sri Lanka 's coconut production by 2040 insufficient to meet the country 's domestic demand . The study by Peiris and others has also suggested that the increased temperature will increase the incidence of pest and other diseases requiring growers to spend more money to control such epidemics . <p> This is bad news for Sri Lanka 's coconut industry which at present depends wholly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avert calamities in the coconut sector <p> These projections are long-term projections and , therefore , subject to many counter developments that would produce results completely different from what the scientists under reference have come up with . Hence , the much-feared warming of the air temperature or the reduction of the rainfall may not even take place . <p> Yet , it is advisable for Sri Lanka to be ready for this eventual calamity by diverting its research potential for the development of crop varieties that has a better chance of survival in increased temperatures and reduced rainfall conditions . It is reported that India has already moved into research in this area , not necessarily to be better prepared for increased temperature , but in a bid to introduce coconut cultivation to relatively arid areas of the country . <p> Sri Lanka stands to gain if it teams up with agronomists and scientists in the rest of the world in this enterprise . <p> ( The writer , a former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka , can be reached at waw1949@gmail.com. )

@@32316232 <h> Youth Observer <h> Harnessing power of serendipity <p> I have always been fascinated by the word ' serendipity ' not because ' Serendip ' is a former name for Sri Lanka . If you delve deep into the meaning of serendipity , you will realise that it is the occurrence and development of events by chance in a happy or beneficial way . The word was coined ( in 1754 ) by Horace Walpole and was suggested by ' The Three Princes of Serendip , ' the title of a fairytale in which the heroes were always making discoveries by accident and sagacity , of things they were not in quest of . A synonym for serendipity is luck , but it lacks the real depth of the meaning . If a beggar finds a diamond while rummaging a heap of garbage for something to eat , it is a clear example of serendipity . What is important to note is that serendipity can happen anywhere , any time . <p> Maureen Fallon who had devoted a major part of her life to the Gyuto monks , representing their monastery in Australia and organising annual tours for Tibetan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A local filmmaker -- Mark Gould -- who was looking for a test audience for his documentary film ' Tibet , Murder in the Snow , ' saw them . While conversing with Gould , Fallon told him that she was looking for a treatment for a stomach ailment that has troubled the Tibetan monks . Later Fallon and Gould travelled to Tibet with a medical team to treat the Guyto monks . The treatment had the desired effect and it proved to be an incident of serendipity . <p> Human life has been drastically changed by chance happenings . If English physicist Isaac Newton had never sat under an apple tree , he would not have discovered the Theory of Gravity . There were many other scientists who had discovered many things by chance . For instance , Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin when he contaminated an experiment . Even the invention of the microwave oven and Velcro 's x-rays has been credited to serendipity . While searching for double stars , William Herschel accidentally discovered the planet Uranus . Christopher Columbus who was looking for a new trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Apart from such major discoveries , most of us have had strokes of good luck . While working as a liaison officer in a government department I did not have much work except answering a few telephone calls and collecting some statistics . To while away the time I used to write feature articles to a national newspaper . I may have contributed a large number of features and most of them were published . One day I received a note from the editor asking me to meet him . Thinking that I had made a blunder , I met him with some trepidation . He looked at me asked , " Do you like to join us as a sub editor ? " It was an offer I had never expected from a newspaper editor . After giving one month 's notice to my employer , I joined the newspaper world not knowing where I would end up . That was a major event of serendipity in my life . <p> I remember a similar event that took place in Australia . Amanda Brotchie was writing an episode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She wanted to cast Matt Preston as a detective but he was working for a rival TV channel . One day she went to a caf ? where she met Preston quite by accident . When she told him about the role he said he was available between commitments . That was a moment of serendipity for Amanda . <p> Sometimes , the moment of serendipity will come after a long time . A Princeton chemist Osamu Shimomura discovered green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) in jellyfish in 1961 . He had been doing experiments for several months to understand what made jellyfish glow . As he made no progress , he threw away the chemical solution into the laboratory sink . He was surprised to see a bright blue flash coming out of it . The sea water had reactivated the bioluminescence . Shimomura won the prestigious Nobel Prize for Chemistry for his discovery of GFP . <p> Chance meeting <p> Although a chance meeting with a stranger or a telephone call from someone in authority will bring you surprises , do not be fooled by unscrupulous people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big lottery prize . They will ask you to make an advance payment to send the prize money . They are not moments of serendipity at all . <p> It is strange but true that some people are more open to serendipity than others . They find themselves in situations where something unexpected always happen . Sometimes you may pick a lottery ticket lying on the road . When you check the results you come to know that you have won a big prize . That is a case of pure serendipity because you have won a prize without buying a sweep ticket . <p> Sometimes people ask whether it is possible to make serendipity happen . Dr Stephann Makri of University College , London says , " The key is to recognise it . " He has been researching for a long time to determine the significance of serendipity as a natural phenomenon . This kind of research can not be done in a laboratory . <p> Therefore , his research was confined to a series of interviews . He had met several people who have had unexpected events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Cross fertilisation ' <p> Some big companies in the West have been trying to harness the power of serendipity through a technique called ' Cross fertilisation . ' Accordingly , all the employees including the top executives are required to walk through a communal space . This is supposed to be an effective way to promote interaction among all the employees . However , in most of our companies lower and middle grade employees never see their bosses . As a young man I worked in a big company for three years but I never met the chairman or any other top executives . <p> Consumer Electronic giant Apple and Google Corporation are streets as far as interpersonal relationships are concerned . <p> At Google Corporation employees spend at least 20 per cent of their work time on new projects . This has boosted the efficiency of the workers . According to Marki , " People are starting to realise that serendipity can set people free , it can help to make them more creative and more agile and less stressed . " <p> Unlike others , scientists in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say most of the scientific discoveries are due to serendipity . In fact , a United States and a Canadian team are publishing the ' Journal of Serendipitous and Unexpected Results .

Its website quotes the late US science fiction author and Bio-chemistry Professor Isaac Asimov : " The most exciting phrase to hear in science , the one that heralds new discoveries , is not ' Eureka ! ' but that 's funny ... " <p> Avoid routine <p> Most of us miss moments of serendipity as we follow a certain routine . We take the same route to reach our office . We see the same old faces in buses and trains . We speak to the same people every day .

@@32359230 <h> A cave temple of ancient origin <p> Buddama , a sleepy hamlet situated in Siyabalanduwa in the Moneragala district 16 km from Moneragala and 6 km from Siyabalanduwa has much historical and religious importance . Archaeological evidence proves that this temple has 600 year-old murals and ancient paintings in the cave . <p> The Buddama Rajamaha Vihara in Siyabalanduwa is my last destination in my journey to Moneragala . My attraction for the Viharais its wall paintings that appeared in a government news magazine published by the Government Information Department called ' Ceylon Today ' in the late 1960s during the Gal Oya Development Project . <p> The photograph was taken by a staff photographer of the Information Department and appeared on the cover of the magazine . Seeing this cover photograph , I had a cherished desire to visit this temple and headed towards the Buddama temple during my recent visit to Moneragala . <p> Rock-cut cave temple <p> On the green hills of Buddama is a rock-cut cave temple that dates back to 3rd century BC . The area was also known as Mahavedi Rata , and was the home of the vanishing Veddha tribe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Buja while hunting with bow and arrow had come across a recumbent Buddha statue sheltered in a rock cave . <p> He promptly reported this to the Rate Mahattaya . It was thereafter that this ancient site was known to civilisation , and since it was found by the Veddha called Buja , it was named Bujjama which later became Buddama . <p> The wooded hamlet of Buddama nestling in all its serenity in the lush jungle vegetation and the magnificent Uva/Wellassa hills in its background in the wilds of Wellassa area consisted of many farming families . <p> The Uva-Wellassa villages are famous for their juicy oranges , and so is Buddama where the trees are laden with the luscious fruit.The Buddama temple has a rock cave with drip-ledges , oval in shape . Rising from the foreground of the temple premises is the first cave you encounter . Here , under the drip-ledges are some inscriptions , some of the letters of which have been obliterated . These inscriptions were of Brahmi characters . Lying at the foot of the Buddama Hela overlooking the cave temple is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the rock many years ago , resulting in a split . That part of the rock with the inscriptions is thus buried in the soil . <p> The entrance to the rock cave temple is now modernised with a tiled roof and a lime washed wall . Although most of the rock cave is still intact , its original built-in walls had been altered some time back . <p> The walls on three sides of the cave were made of mud and stone , and the original texture still preserved . Inside the cave temple is a serene recumbent statue of the Buddha in perfect appearance which too has been touched up . The cave ceiling and walls adorn some Kandyan period murals in the form of lotus petals and circular discs with lines drawn across which too have been very much altered in recent times . <p> The length of the recumbent Buddha is about 30 feet . There are also two seated Buddha statues made of clay and stone with the pedestals well preserved . <p> We found two wooden moulds , one of a seated Buddha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cave are adorned with paintings depicting a painting of the Buddha . <p> Early settlements <p> Uva Viharavansa , a chronical on the historic temples in the Uva Province describes places of Buddhist worship in Buddama even before the advent of Buddhism in Sri Lanka . It was one of the early settlements in the country . The chronical says that Robert Knox who spent many years in the country as a prisoner of the Kandyan Kingdom visited the Buddama Rajamaha Viharaya . <p> It is said that the Buddama Hela of the temple comprising more than 20 caves had been a vocational training centre for local craftsmen before it became a monastery , after the advent of Buddhism during the Anuradhapura period . An ancient Velipeella ( black painted board strewn with sand ) used in ancient times to practise writing letters , had been located in between two rocks which formed a cave . History has it that Ven . Nape Buddarakkitha Thera , a resident Bhikkhu of the Buddama Rajamaha Vihara , was one of the leaders of the 1818 riots against British rule . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ archaeological remains of the temple including the statues and the murals have been left to the mercy of the elements.Treasure hunters have caused extensive damage to the ancient murals and recumbent Buddha statues . <p> Officials of the Department of Archaeology have restored the main Buddha statue touching up damaged spots in the statue . However , the historic temple is in danger of being destroyed due to neglect . <p> Ancient grandeur is seen at this lesser known historic temple at Buddama , located amid the lush greenery in the remote countryside . <p> On our way back , we visited the fascinating Inginimitiya reservoir near Buddama which gives much beauty to the area , and was one of the tanks renovated during the Mahaweli development program in 1980 to help the farming community in the area .

They are also required to devise innovative business strategies to provide seamless services to customers using technological infrastructures during this extremely challenging period . <p> This is a time financial institution are expected to revisit their institutional purposes . This is a time financial systemic resilience and market integrity need to be safeguarded by the players in the system without frequent directions from regulators . The pandemic has taught us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society and environment are closely interconnected elements of a one large fabric . Therefore , every stakeholder needs to understand the mutually-reinforcing possibilities for each other . <p> In the context of rapidly-evolving challenges , imposing regulations applicable to every transaction , every market innovation and every business scenario will have practical difficulties . This will increase the regulatory burden and the pressure to promote a culture of compliance with the letter of law on the part of financial institutions . <p> Eventually , taking business decisions during crisis periods in compliance with applicable rules and regulations will be in the hands of Boards of Directors ( BODs ) and Key Management Personnel ( KMP ) of such institutions . Their fitness and propriety to hold such positions should , therefore , be a foremost requirement which needs to be emphasised in any given circumstance . It assumes even greater importance in times of crisis . <p> No amount of regulations will ensure that public deposits are safe unless the decisions pertaining to management of such money are taken by individuals who are honest , well-qualified and experienced acting with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also the quality and competence of individuals that have a huge impact on effective governance in financial firms . <p> This article sheds light on the significance of efficient enforcement of regulations applicable to fitness and propriety of BODs and KMP of financial institutions in order to have robust risk governance structures during a crisis like the Covid-19 outbreak . <p> The Director of Bank Supervision of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka ( CBSL ) is required to assess the fitness and propriety of the BOD/KMP to be appointed to licensed banks in terms of the criteria stipulated under the Banking Act No.30 of 1988 of Sri Lanka . The suitability assessment of BOD/KMPs of licensed finance companies is carried out in terms of stipulations in the Finance Business Act No.42 of 2011 of Sri Lanka . <p> These persons are required to disclose their educational and professional qualifications , experiences in the financial services sector , and other information pertaining to conflicts of interests , if any , by way of affidavits in accordance with the directions issued under the said laws . <p> Since there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is important to enforce rigorous fitness and propriety criteria without any compromise . Providing accurate and timely information is also equally important to ensure an effective suitability assessment exercise . Furnishing inaccurate information is an offence punishable under the aforementioned laws . <p> International best practice <p> In terms of the guidelines issued by the Basel Committee , BODs of banks should comprise individuals with a balance of skills , diversity and expertise who collectively possess the necessary qualifications commensurate with the size , complexity and risk profile of the bank . Modern management places a high premium on cognitive diversity associated with factors , such as gender and background . <p> It needs to be reiterated , however , that irrespective of the size of a financial entity , integrity , criminal and civil records need to be examined in appointing BOD/KMPs . Technical knowledge and experience may be varied according to the business scope , risk appetite and corporate structure of a firm . However , honesty and integrity are essential characteristics for every person at every financial institution . <p> Senior managers and certification regime -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Certification Regime ' of the UK , individuals intending to carry on certain specified senior management functions at UK banks are required to obtain prior approval from the Prudential Regulatory Authority ( PRA ) or the Financial Conduct Authority ( FCA ) , as applicable . <p> The approval of the regulators is given only if they are satisfied that the candidate is a fit and proper person to carry out the senior management function for which the approval is sought . A person 's honesty , integrity , competence , capability and reputation as well as financial soundness are considered in this exercise . <p> PRA and FCA also expect banks to carry out extensive referencing and due diligence prior to recruiting a person by checking the relevant person 's suitability for the post , criminal records and other required qualifications . PRA and FCA are empowered to interview prospective candidates performing senior management functions at banks prior to approving their fitness and propriety . <p> Although CBSL does not conduct such interviews during the process of fitness and propriety assessment , it is emphasised that relevant nominations for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nomination Committee ' of the relevant bank/finance company . What is of paramount importance in carrying out this regulatory exercise by the CBSL is its independence to decide the fitness and propriety of a person . The regulator should be able to conduct the assessment free from political or any other interference . In the event decisions pertaining to fitness and propriety assessment are subject to such influences , guaranteeing suitable appointments for financial institutions becomes difficult . <p> Eventually the integrity of the financial system and the safety of public funds will be at risk as persons who are not fit and proper end up performing managerial functions at financial institutions . This should be applicable to state owned institutions as well . It is important to ensure suitable persons are nominated for state owned banks by political authorities to enable the regulator to grant the required approvals through independent assessments . <p> Senior managers ' accountability regime <p> In terms of this scheme , applications for approval for individuals to perform a senior management function need to be submitted along with a statement of responsibilities assigned to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' responsibilities map ' describing the firm 's governance and management arrangements . <p> When a specific responsibility map is available , supervisors and regulators can identify the wrongdoers in the event of a violation of applicable rules and regulations . It will improve genuine accountability in financial firms by removing ambiguous bureaucratic structures with unclear lines of responsibility . This mechanism will lead to increased duty of responsibility as well . <p> During the statutory examinations , supervisors can bring a claim of misconduct specifically against the responsible person . It will also help pierce the corporate veil to create an effective deterrence effect against non-compliances and misconduct . Conducting investigations into regulatory breaches is also less difficult when there is a ' specific responsibility map ' of a financial entity . <p> This should not be mistaken as regulatory intervention in business decisions in a manner of micromanaging . What is emphasised under this accountability regime is the requirement to ensure compliance with internal controls as well as regulatory parameters when business decisions are taken by the responsible individual . Having a precise responsibilities map is advantageous not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a financial firm . <p> In terms of the rules and regulations issued under existing Banking Act of Sri Lanka , there is a requirement to assess the fitness and propriety of continuing BOD/KMPs . This assessment can be executed effectively if specific responsibility maps are available . The provisions of section 51 of the Finance Business Act No.42 of 2011 of Sri Lanka provide for taking action against unlawful gain/ undue losses incurred by an employee of a licensed finance company . Identifying such misconduct will also be easier using the accountability statements . <p> According to Megan Butler , when we talk about being fit and proper ... we are not merely talking about financial decision making but also in terms of culture ... we do not compartmentalise what makes people fit and proper . Making fitness and propriety assessments in a very holistic manner is , therefore , of paramount importance in fostering a sound compliance culture in financial firms in Sri Lanka as well . <p> Suitability assessment in the European Union <p> In granting approvals for appointments of BOD of banks in the EU , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and propriety of relevant persons in terms of five main criteria i.e. experience , reputation , conflict of interest and independence of mind , time commitment and collective suitability . Clean criminal record , history of fiscal or administrative irregularities , pending legal proceedings as well as the adequacy of diversity of the board are also taken into account by the EU . <p> It would be prudent to introduce these requirements to the Sri Lankan regulatory regime as well . According to the suitability guidelines issued by the European Banking Authority , member states of the EU are required to ensure that board members of their financial institutions be of sufficiently good repute and possess sufficient knowledge , skills and experience at all times to perform their duties . <p> Exchange of information within sectors <p> It is important to establish a mechanism to exchange information between regulators in assessing the suitability of BOD/KMP of financial institutions through a harmonised approach . Inter regulatory coordination will have to be given priority in modern day financial regulatory agendas . A person who has been disqualified by one regulatory authority should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system . Maintaining a comprehensive database of disqualified persons will be very vital for the purpose of exchanging information . <p> The global financial crisis , as well as the failures in domestic financial institutions in Sri Lanka , have revealed that poor governance structures and misconduct of employees were among the root causes of crises . Fitness and propriety assessment should , therefore , be given a prominent place in regulatory frameworks and carried out in an unbiased independent manner with a view to ensuring improved risk oversight and resilience of financial institutions . <p> Providing induction and training to BOD/KMPs for proper organisational behaviours <p> Financial institutions should be required to establish appropriate training policies to educate newly appointed , as well as continuing BOD/KMPs , about evolving financial market structures , fintech , cybersecurity and other technological advances as well as human resources and corporate governance policies . Enhancing their knowledge and skills to cope with crisis situations like the current pandemic is a very important element of sustainability agendas . Appropriate training will empower BOD/KMP to lead by example to find a novel institutional purpose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world is experiencing at present . <p> As former Governor of the Bank of England , Mark Carney , stated ' inclusive capitalism ' should be embedded in the novel institutional purposes of financial institutions . Right minded competent people are needed for the financial services industry to achieve such goals . Customised training programs commensurate with the needs of each financial firm should be organised to inculcate a broad and practical knowledge in the minds of their employees . <p> Behavioural perspectives and suitability assessments <p> The typical , habitual behaviours and mindsets that characterise a particular organisation are treated as the ' culture of a firm ' according to the definition put forward by the FCA . Behaviours of BOD/KMPs are based on their mindsets . Since the regulators are unable to check the attitudes in people 's heads , it is important at least to ensure that people with sound qualities are appointed and they are well trained to cultivate ethical behaviours in financial institutions . Although paper qualifications can not give a hundred percent guarantee on integrity and honesty of a person such requirements help in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market theory and neoliberalism , which downgraded regulatory intervention , failed to deliver desired outcomes during the Global Financial Crisis .

Outcome was that neo-classical regulatory paradigm 's failure to deliver a safe and sound financial system . Therefore , post global financial crisis regulatory reforms are informed of the fact that regulation is important to have efficient market resource allocation or coordination in an economy . <p> We can consider the fitness and propriety requirement as one of such regulatory components . When the most suitable persons are handling management affairs of financial institutions , they are more likely to be guided by appropriate regulations focused on safeguarding the rights of all stakeholders and systemic resilience . It can be argued that prescriptive regulations will help in addressing issues emanating from behavioural aspects of managers . <p> Regulatory frameworks can mitigate adverse impacts on risk governance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who act in a self-serving manner . The rationale behind the suitability assessment is to ensure that qualified persons are engaged in implementing business decisions of financial entities without creating detrimental effects which undermine systemic stability . <p> During the current pandemic induced crisis , it is very important that financial institutions focus on addressing social inequality which is on the rise due to the consequences of the twin health and economic crises . It is vital to have mechanisms to allocate resources in a more productive manner to advance the economic welfare of vulnerable groups . <p> Rewritten responsibilities of BOD/KMPs till we come out of the woods <p> Suitability assessment of BOD/KMPs of financial institutions needs to be emphasised as an integral part of the risk management system of such entities . Individual suitability assessments need to be aimed at ensuring BOD/KMP have the right mix of hard and soft skills to promote effective governance systems .

Priority should also be attached to emergency succession planning and business continuity plans while guarding against the health risk for employees . Working from home plans and remote access to systems need to be executed along with robust plans for mitigating cybersecurity threats . <p> The crisis has strengthened the compulsions for BODs/KMP to shift from a shareholder-centric model to a responsible corporate citizen model . This requires a very delicate balancing exercise in the face of looming uncertainty .

The virus has changed the way we live for many months . It should have opened up our minds too and that is what makes a winner at the end . We have to ensure that it will not extract a heavy toll from us and that we come out stronger -- Pic by Shehan Gunasekara <p> Leapfrogging is a favourite action word we usually use to indicate the desire to move ahead with little bit of speed and jump disregarding the normal to get ahead of the curve , etc . Most of the time in our minds hearing the word may conjure up something big being planned or expected . These days there is no normal situation but only plenty of issues in a highly dynamic setting . <p> While the virus is displaying the power of the exponential , being a step ahead is complicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and perhaps more between the practitioners could be quite testing . Within the dynamics of this situation and its management so much understanding and awareness has to be present . <p> The knowledge and experience required as we move on with the second wave is significantly different from the first wave and the virus too had mutated with time . Of course the situation perhaps was made complicated by what we did not do between the first and the second . This is where the attitude and outlook can not be like frogs in the well if one is to succeed ! There is a responsibility by many in ensuring that we move ahead instead of getting stuck in a state of complacency or bickering . Old answers are definitely not solutions to the current crop of problems . <p> COVID-19 is seriously challenging all of us <p> COVID-19 is seriously challenging all of us . We may not indicate all the data and one good reason for that situation is we do not know all the data and what you do not know you can not tell ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be coming from a wish list . A fact that we can not ignore is the necessity of taking decisions with long term in mind yet managing the short term well . <p> Across the world COVID-19 is playing havoc and many surely are seriously suffering . However the approach in resolving issues is definitely going to separate winners and losers on a global platform , of course aided and abetted by the virus . As we write we have two candidate vaccines having demonstrated over 90% efficacy . One is by a well-established company and the other a start-up from a University . For the moment the better data though marginally has come from the start up . Coming this far within this timeframe is actually a success considering the typical vaccine development time scales mooted at the initial stages of the pandemic . A third generating vaccine development mechanism has been used utilising advanced technology . There , however , a challenge still awaits of scaling up production and logistics of getting the vaccine to the billions . <p> Another observation is the parallel development of factories with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are also a novelty and not the usual manner of development . These steps have dramatically cut down on the established times for vaccine development . Of course some say the head start for the COVID-19 vaccine was actually given by the work coming from the SARS era . <p> Another development , the Russian vaccine , even went on to name their vaccine as Sputnik as a reminder to the world on their technological prowess . In innovation literature we have the term Sputnik moment -- a reminder to one nation to act fast in the face of strides made by another . This was the situation that developed in the space race between Soviet Union and United States . <p> Sri Lanka must understand the Sputnik moment <p> Sri Lanka too must understand the Sputnik moment . As I indicated in the last column while the country has suffered a precipitous drop in the global innovation ranking the neighbour India has climbed up to be in the top 50 . China is well up on the ladder . The use of science and technology has been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did a crash course in S&amp;T engagement and the growth acceleration has been remarkable . While many were seeing a serious drop in economic performance of China due to COVID-19 it has demonstrated to be one country with decent growth numbers at present . Many others are tottering having to display embarrassingly negative economic numbers . We ourselves have not released immediate figures and postponed communications to the year-end . Hong Kong is showing how they are running the system with technology and discipline coupled together . <p> Across many countries the second wave management is showing distinct differences from the first . Some countries are of course buoyed by the fact that they are leaders in the race for the vaccine . Of course some methods deployed in management definitely invades on privacy and releases so much data of oneself to the outside . The virus has accelerated some segments of technologies to dominance . Zoom , another startup , has accelerated to have a value almost twice the GDP of Sri Lanka . Zoom is almost becoming the synonym for a virtual meeting ! <p> Science and tech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and education are still critical issues for us . For some the technology has aided well . However for many the benefits of technology are still outside their reach . There is a need to understand and plan early to ensure that the vaccine becoming available at some point in future becoming accessible to the critical group of personnel quickly . WHO may support but the infrastructure needs have to be set up from within . <p> We know that the two most promising candidate vaccines do require a cold chain facility with quite a low temperature -- an infrastructure that we do not have . The Oxford University vaccine , which has been developed with the classical development pathway , does give us a chance with the existing facilities . <p> A country that has shown strength starting much later -- Vietnam -- developed antigen testing at an early stage of COVID-19 . There is a serious need to consider why within our economy and system such developments are not possible . We also have to reflect why only controversy usually surrounds whenever something different is happening or mooted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not science that gets discussed or lead the situation in our country but polarised exchanges . <p> This crisis is requesting us to understand the Sputnik moment . Many economies are simply moving past us . We can not leapfrog by tinkering on old principles of economics . Paul Romer , the most recent Nobel Prize winner on economics , has been credited with his theory of endogenous economic growth from technology innovations . He has followed his theory from the 1987 Nobel economics laureate Robert Solow who won his prize for espousing the role of technology developed with R&amp;D investments for making United States for what it is . <p> These concepts , which are finding place in many minds outside , are quite visible for having no effect in local minds . In the economic parlance the usual way of looking at leapfrogging was to enable small and incremental innovations . What was considered was if an organisation continues to engage in such that such effort would be sufficient to keep the organisation ahead of its competitors . However this is not right today . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innovation is almost always around the corner . Over decades this possibility has been shown . Also over the same decades the divergence power of technology too had been amply demonstrated and that is why we have situations like climate change on us . Therein lies the importance of opening up and understanding from all available opportunities and ensuring that your actions are well thought of and evidence based . <p> The economy in moving forward needs investments in areas that we have been shy for most of the time . Our expenditure on R&amp;D as a percentage of GDP has been falling since independence . Our investments to ensure that ideas reach market had been almost invisible . We have worked quite hard to ensure that outside ideas reach our market ! We must understand the strong need for the manufacturing sector to grow . Fortunately the Budget presented has articulated that . This is a vital sector that needs to come out of the state of doldrums that it is in . <p> Leapfrog and emerge stronger <p> Leapfrogging required here is the quick action in ensuring that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is rapidly reversed through the adoption of modern systems without going through any intermediate steps . Easier said than done but we have to ask ourselves a question -- is there another way ? I am sure the answer from Paul would be NO ! <p> It is instructive to observe in a critical situation how industry responded in USA . President Franklin Roosevelt gave pre-WWII American industry a request to produce more than 10 times the rate than ever done before . The request was 10 times and President 's comment upon getting the feedback of can not do was that the American industry would find a way ... and they did and set new benchmarks in the process . This drive , the response is needed today within our system too . <p> As a vaccine is about to hit the skin the world may be yearning for normalcy .

They often do not last long and also run the risk of being obsolete even before the completion of the construction -- Pic by Shehan Gunasekara <p> Among many factors affecting the development of the country adversely , one factor that has been constantly overlooked by both politicians and economists alike is the lack of wealth preservation and accumulation in the country . What is this wealth accumulation ? <p> Have a deep look out of your window , and inquire as to how many constructions will last beyond next 50 years . It is very likely that almost all the buildings , except a few , will have to be demolished and rebuilt again in few decades . A handful of buildings in major cities might just stand the test of time for several more decades , but the situation in rural areas is hopeless . What does this mean , and why it matters ? The wealth accumulation is woven to a healthy and growing economy as much as the gravity is woven to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses . This is the process of generating wealth . From the perspective of economics , they trap a large part of their wealth in buildings . If the buildings that they build do not last beyond a few decades or have to be renovated substantially , their wealth and material legacy will completely vanish in a few decades . <p> The buildings may have to be demolished for reasons of structural unsafety or simply that they are not fit for the current purpose . The next generation has to build again for their needs at a significantly higher cost . There is no wealth accumulation in this process . We can explain this further using an example . <p> Think about a hypothetical scenario where your parents have built a house spending their entire wealth and passed it to you . However , you consider that it is not fit for your purpose . If you build a new house at the same location after demolishing the tired house , you will not only erase your parent 's legacy , but also destroy the wealth of the nation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build a new house elsewhere , you could preserve the wealth . If the first house is not for your purpose , you can simply sell it . As long as it is intact and can be used by some other family , no significant wealth destruction occurs . This sentiment is straightforwardly valid to Government constructions as well . <p> What is the role of the Government in this process to preserve the wealth of the nation ? The wealth generation is done by the citizenry , but the duty of care obligation for wealth **25;36;TOOLONG exclusively falls upon the Government . The wealth **25;63;TOOLONG is however something much more than building to last . <p> Among many things to do , certainly what the Government should not do is to use any heavy-handed approaches like prohibiting people from demolishing houses and forcing them to live in old dilapidated houses . That is absolutely not helpful for a free society . The Government should instead use more graceful approaches such as introducing minimal standard for private constructions , making timeless architecture easily available to people , making buying and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and property repurposing . <p> Currently , Government constructions are also in dismal condition . They often do not last long and also run the risk of being obsolete even before the completion of the construction . The planning process should be thorough and ambitious , and more importantly include a funding mechanism for the maintenance of these constructions . If need be , a statutory framework should be formulated tto fund the maintenance of key constructions . There are several key areas where the attention is urgently needed . <p> Sri Lanka has now become a remittance economy . Since 2005 , people who seek foreign employment have exponentially increased , and majority of them are women from rural areas . As of 2019 , Sri Lanka has been receiving personal remittance over $ 7 billion per year from these employees . <p> The obligations of the Government should extend beyond just giving rupees for migrant workers ' foreign currencies , and should include duty of care obligations such as introducing wealth **25;90;TOOLONG methods for these migrant workers .

The Government should do more to make sure that these luxury apartments last long for many generations to come in order to witness the true benefit of these foreign investments . <p> Currently , Lakvijaya coal power plant generates 18% of the country 's energy burning 2.25 million tons of coal per year . Burning four to eight tons of coal produces one ton of coal ash , of which about 39% is fly ash . The air-borne ash particulates from the plant have been monitored even in Colombo .

@@32380233 <h> Classified <h> Other <h> Working from home : Weird or wired ? <p> Many employees around the world have replaced their commute to work with electronic links to their workplace . Telecommuting to work is trending upward <p> The second wave of COVID-19 is hitting us much harder than we anticipated . With a high alert level , working from home has again become the dire reality . Some around the globe have been doing it now for so many months . Technically speaking , it is the trend known as telecommuting . The time has come to revisit it and to reflect on it , with effectiveness in mind . <p> From commuting to telecommuting <p> It was Sir Arthur C. Clarke who wisely said , " Do not commute but communicate " . When the number of vehicles is on the rise and the roads remain same , the obvious realty is increasing congestion on the way to work . Commuting has thus become a hassle for many in both private and public sectors alike . A tendency towards a better way to work has become a dire need with the planetary pandemic that we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as working outside the conventional workplace and communicating with it by way of telecommunications or computer-based technology . It constitutes an early form of ' virtual ' work , which has inspired research disciplines ranging from transportation and urban planning to ethics , law , sociology and organisational studies . Amongst several forms of ' work-at-home ' , I would use the term ' telecommuting ' to refer to work carried out at home during regular office hours by employees of organisations . <p> Many employees around the world have replaced their commute to work with electronic links to their workplace . Telecommuting to work is trending upward . Although this is an innovative way to complete work , there are significant risks experienced by both the organisation and the employee who is engaged in telecommuting . When a telecommuting experience is unsuccessful there may be a tendency to conclude that the situation was not conducive to telecommuting . This type of conclusion would tell only a part of the story . An important issue pertains to the suitability of an individual for a telecommuting experience . Thus , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues that will contribute to the suitability of the telecommuting experience for both individual and organisation . <p> Contributing factors <p> Certain factors in the last few decades have led toward the reliance on and adoption of telecommunication in the workplace . Many factors contribute to the background , implementation , and advantages of companies executing telecommunication . One such factor contributing to telecommunication is cost reduction . Organisations can save money by reducing the amount of work space and other work environment enhancers in its offices . Campbell ( 2007 ) makes the point that less money is spent on workstations , maintenance , utility bills , common office space , and insurance . <p> Organisations may also implement telecommunication in order to retain ' geographical freedom ' in the ever-changing work environment . Some companies do not have a static geographical base . Instead they rely solely on telecommunication , and mostly engage in internet-based businesses . Companies can maintain an employee pool worldwide with employees in many time zones , and each person can work at hours convenient for them . Younger generations are more inclined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their desire for autonomy in the workplace . Such organisations who encourage telecommuting have more potential to succeed in the event of a natural disaster , terrorist attack , or epidemic . <p> As we obviously see now , there may be advantages to telecommuting during the traditional height of flu season , not to mention winter blizzards and weather calamities , some experts are advising that businesses prepare for the worst by planning to allow employees to telecommute . Furthermore , in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks of 9/11 in the USA , pre-established telework practices at American Express helped ensure that the business could continue functioning . By decentralising the workforce , companies can still maintain operational readiness under almost any situation . <p> Individual benefits <p> In addition to corporate advantages and savings , the individual employee can also benefit from telecommuting . Organisations who support telecommuting to their employees offer the employees ' fiscal savings on the individual employee 's work-related costs , such as work clothing , transportation , lunches out , child care , and other various costs associated with working outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from work can be nearly eliminated with the use of telecommuting thus producing a happier , more efficient worker . <p> Telecommuting also offers employees greater opportunity to balance work and personal life . With flexible schedules and mobile technology , employees are no longer tied down to one specific location during the work day in order to accomplish their responsibilities . The increased scheduling flexibility gives the employee the opportunity to provide more care to their family ; an absolute necessity for single parents taking care of their children . <p> Employees also save time by eliminating the commute to and from work . These hours can be used for personal pursuits or as additional hours in the work week , thus creating more efficiency and job satisfaction among employees . With increased trust towards employees , companies can expect to gain a return of trust towards company from telecommuting employees . <p> Telecommuting is also offered as an employee benefit for companies wishing to retain employees who are either unsatisfied with their work environment or who are looking for another job . Hence , the advantages of telecommuting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are plenty . Money , moral , efficiency , crisis-reaction , and time are all major factors of implementing telecommuting to the company and individual work-related schedules . <p> Critical success factors for telecommuting <p> A clear look at an institution and its individuals will provide a gross yardstick for considering the potential for the implementation of telecommuting . Two most important factors can be identified , in this context . They are the institutional and individual capacity ( IC ) for telecommuting , and the amenability of the work to telecommuting ( WA ) . Amenability is usually referred to as the flexible nature of work which allows it to be handled by employees in optional ways . Based on the ongoing research work by Professor Michel Buckley of University of Oklahoma and myself , few scenarios can be proposed . Figure 1 shows us four such different scenarios that can occur in this context . <p> It must be stated that this is mostly an initial evaluation and there could be myriad other factors which influence this decision . <p> Industry scenarios <p> Based on the typology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let us look at typical Sri Lankan situations , specially amidst COVID-19 second wave . <p> Scenario 1 : Telecommuting Misfit ( IC -- low , WA -- low ) <p> Nandana is a production supervisor in a manufacturing plant . His work involves physically interacting with the factory operatives . He explored the possibility of working from home , by watching the factory floor through CCTV footage accessible online but was not so realistic . This could be the case with many other industry sectors where physical presence of employees on a daily basis is the norm . <p> Scenario 2 : Work Constraints ( IC -- high , WA -- low ) <p> Nirmana is a creative writer in an advertising firm in Colombo . His company is flexible in allowing him to work from home . However , he has to visit clients and needs to attend regular meetings in others ' offices . Hence , there is a challenge for him to fully resort to telecommuting . A similar case may prevail with many other firms where customers still expect physical interactions . <p> Scenario 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high ) <p> Nevinda is an entrepreneurial CEO of a trading organisation based in Galle . He has a dozen of marketing executives who used to work in a large office . With the dismal performance of last year , he is under pressure from the board of directors for more stringent cost control . However , he has financial issues in dealing with infrastructure requirements such as computer availability with internet connectivity for his employees . Thus , even though the team is very much willing , the support for telecommuting does not exist here . This is also not very uncommon in many other areas , with the increasing computer literacy rate . Shortcomings in the necessary infrastructure can hinder the cost-effective utilisation of available talent . <p> Scenario 4 : Telecommuting Fit ( IC -- high , WA -- high ) <p> Nayantha is a systems analyst and enjoys working late night in Kandy . He need not go to office , thanks to the flexible arrangement offered by his firm . With the internet connectivity , he shares his programs with the office and is available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in different locations and there is no need to be physically present at meetings in the office . He uses web2 tools to be in touch with his clients and colleagues . This position is very much amenable to telecommuting . <p> We can find a variety of such opportunities in Sri Lanka . ICT industry can be stated as the forerunner in this approach . With an able set of software developers and having projects that have components that can be handled in a flexible manner , telecommuting becomes possible . Yet , the effectiveness of such a practice relies on several job and family-related factors . <p> It is worthwhile pondering as to which of the above scenarios is more relevant to one 's workplace , with associated internal and external aspects . <p> Way forward <p> Working from home will play an important role in the future world of work . It has its associated challenges and constraints . Maintaining a work-family harmony with increased telecommuting is another vital aspect that needs a separate detailed discussion . As the above typology clearly showed us , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of specific tasks that can be handled through telecommuting , as well as ensuring the availability of necessary infrastructure are critical steps in this direction .

However , this has created several challenges such as allowing access to centralised ERP , ensure secure authentication and access and network connectivity issues . <p> Few also highlighted that ensuring employee engagement and productivity in a virtual working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Changing nature of competition <p> Competition in the digital age is entirely different from what companies have seen before , due to the rise of start-ups and unconventional players entering and trying to grab the market share from incumbents . <p> Even though true disruption is yet to be seen in Sri Lanka , bank and insurance CIOs have acknowledged the entry of telecom companies in financial services domain can be a key competitive threat unlike they have experienced before . <p> However , there were four specific technologies that were highlighted by all our participants ; <p> Cloud -- Cloud transformation was identified as a key priority and many companies who had already invested in comprehensive ERP systems are now planning to transition in to Cloud based ERP systems , driven by the increasing flexibility and cost efficiencies it promises to generate . <p> Mobile -- Due to growing smart phone penetration in the country , many corporates are attempting to deliver exceptional mobile experiences to their consumers . This range from m-commerce , targeted mobile advertising , mobile wallets and touchless airport kiosks that can be accessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Process Automation has been widely used by many of the participants to automate certain manufacturing processes in factory environments , from Apparel to FMCG and personal care . Also , some companies have employed RPA to transform their back-office operations . <p> Analytics -- Analytics is another key priority for many Sri Lankan corporates . Both analytics and big data analytics are used by companies to analyse and predict consumer behaviours . <p> Even though other emerging technologies such as IoT , AI/ML , Blockchain are being used by some of the companies , they are still at very early or experimental stages . <p> Opportunities arising from the trends ; digital leaders see five key digital transformation opportunities in Sri Lanka that companies can capitalise on ; <p> Personalisation and differentiation <p> Availability of big data and advanced analytical capabilities ( augmented by AI/ML ) offer Sri Lankan companies the ability to deliver personalised offerings to their customers while also supporting in differentiating their value proposition from their competitors . <p> A CIO of a diversified conglomerate shared that integrated data has the ability to offer the group a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data via multiple industries like banking , insurance and retail . <p> Digital channels <p> Many Sri Lankan companies have started offering an omni-channel experience to their customers via a hybrid of physical and digital channels . <p> As stated by few CIOs , this is especially important in banking and financial services . Opening and operating a new physical branch is involved with significant overheads which will increase bank 's cost to income ratio . As digital finance disruptors like telcos and start-ups can operate cost effectively in a much larger scale , banks need to develop digital channels to reach mass scale of customers . This is evident via the proliferation of mobile apps , wallets and other smart consumer touch points over the last two years . <p> Digital Marcom and engagement <p> Many CIOs have identified that the advancements of digital marketing have presented many new opportunities for Sri Lankan companies . This include reaching out to customers via multiple internet and social media channels , ability to run hypertargeted personalised campaigns and engage with customers and prospects via rich content . <p> However as highlighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sri Lanka when it comes to Digital Marcom . This includes skill gaps in comprehending digital marcom analytics and lack of tools that can support Sinhala and Tamil content . <p> Reinvent business models <p> Digital technologies have enabled companies to reinvent their business models through new sources of value creation , revenue generation and the use of wide eco-systems . <p> For example , in the media and telecom domains Over-the-top ( OTT ) technology that enables content providers such as Netflix have bypassed cable TV providers to bring content to users . However , as a response to this , cable TV companies/Telcos have started collaborating with them . <p> Also , a few digital leaders have highlighted cross-industry collaboration between companies in domains like banking , insurance , technology and telecom to offer joint solutions and creating value across the entire eco-system . <p> The global pandemic has made the world further unpredictable and uncertain . To navigate through these difficult times , the digital leaders emphasised that Sri Lankan companies should be agile and nimble in the way they conduct their business . <p> As shared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth of e-commerce , unpredictable demand and disruptions in the supply chain , factories have to run at optimal levels in order to cater to the customer demand . <p> Technology and telecom companies in Sri Lanka have been running agile at scale programs even before the pandemic and had converted traditional waterfall projects in to agile sprints , which has already generated tangible business results . <p> Challenges <p> Despite the many benefits that digital technologies offer , many inherent challenges exist in their implementation . The following three key challenges were observed across all responses ; <p> Culture and change management <p> This was unanimously viewed as the biggest challenge for digital transformation <p> Most of the aging staff members are comfortable in the old ways of doing things and have the attitude of " if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it . " <p> All the respondents have highlighted the importance of leadership in driving digital transformation initiatives . Many believe the leadership should come from the Board and CEO level . <p> Other important point that was emphasised is the engagement of business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a cross-functional approach and should not be perceived as just an ' IT project ' . If business users are not engaged , resistance to be expected . <p> However , it was also highlighted that COVID-19 has helped for staff and especially for management to understand the importance of digital transformation and had solved many cultural issues . <p> Investment and ROI -- big investment , how to convince , payback periods can be long , spent lot of money on legacy systems <p> Implementation of digital initiatives require almost all the time high level of investment in hardware infrastructure , software , networks and skills . <p> As per the respondents , most companies have invested significantly on basic infrastructure such as ERP systems . For some of the investments the ROI may not be visible immediately and can take a longer payback period than expected . <p> Therefore , some of the digital leaders are finding it difficult to convince boards on new investment . Which is also amplified by the prevailing pandemic situation and freeze on investments and recruitment by many Sri Lankan corporates . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greater understanding of leadership on the importance of digital , IT investments are the only exceptions to otherwise organisation wide investment and recruitment freeze . <p> Data and analytics <p> While data and analytics is a great opportunity for Sri Lankan corporates , it also presents numerous challenges . <p> Many digital leaders aspire to make their organisations data driven and implementing initiatives to have integrated data platforms to enable that . However , they encounter resistance from both customers and other supply chain and channel partners who are reluctant to share data . <p> Even in the data that they capture , they face challenges in terms of quality and reliability of data as it can affect the data driven decision making . <p> Also , given the surge in cybercrimes , companies have to adapt to state-of-the-art cyber security solutions in order to protect data privacy . This was especially highlighted by the banking industry as they are prone to be attacked by cybercriminals due the nature of information they hold . <p> Initiatives and future priorities <p> It was observed that regardless of the size , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very diverse spectrum . Some companies are in the initial stages of exploration and getting started while others have started their journey years ago and being constantly learning and re-inventing themselves . <p> Regardless of where they are currently in the digital transformation journey , following four were identified as key priorities and initiatives for the next 1.5-2 years ; <p> Developing a digital strategy and road map <p> Most digitally advanced Sri Lankan companies and groups have already developed a holistic digital strategy and a road map for their organisation , which guide their digital transformation journey . <p> This is not merely a technology plan , rather covers a broad spectrum of areas such as business scope and strategy , vision , mission , goals and objectives , organisational structure and staff , technology systems , processes , performance management , risk , compliance and governance . For an example , see ' MTI 's Financial Services Digital Transformation Model ' . <p> As per some of the respondents , they have developed this for a longer term like three years , but each quarter or so they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Data analytics <p> Most of the organisations that were covered as part of this study aspire to become a data driven organisation by the next two years . <p> However , the approach taken by them can be different . While one company has centralised their data analytics unit , serving multiple business units and functions , another company has decentralised and placed data analytics teams at each BU and function . <p> Most of the companies are investing in data infrastructure such as data warehouses , CRMs , data lakes , mass data management systems and analytics and visualisation tools . <p> Also , many respondents shared that they have started investing in data analytics skills , both by hiring data scientists , analysts and engineers and training existing business users . <p> Skills development and awareness <p> Another major initiative almost all the companies are driving is increasing organisation wide awareness on the importance of digital transformation and upskilling of all staff members . <p> Many have identified this as a major imperative to address staff resistance and reluctance to change . <p> Several initiatives are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training and coaching both in hard and soft skills , appointing digital evangelists to promote digital adoption within the culture and implementing digital KPIs linked to incentives . <p> Experimental projects ( new tech AI , IOT , 4.0 ) <p> As per the digital leaders , many organisations have started experimenting on emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence , IoT , Industry 4.0 and Blockchain . <p> Few CIOs shared that they are actively collaborating with start-ups , tech vendors and partners to develop Minimum Viable Products ( MVP ) to address customer pain points , by incorporating these technologies . <p> Some of these MVPs include AI Chat Bots for customer service , IOT based predictive maintenance of machinery in a factory environment , AI based risk assessments etc . <p> As highlighted by a few CIOs , the advantage of this approach is companies can test the hypothesis and solution with minimal investment and can scale the solution if it is a success . <p> Digital technologies and trends are transforming and disrupting the organisations . No industry or organisation is immune from this transformation .

@@32416230 <h> Collective responsibility to reduce greenhouse gas emissions <p> Cyclone Burevi which last week hit the Eastern coast of Sri Lanka leaving a trail of damaged houses and thousands of homeless persons has shifted national focus to the impacts caused on human beings especially on their health and quality of life . In their latest studies , weather experts believe the occurrence of such severe weather patterns shifting from extreme heat to extreme cold , from floods to droughts has surged in recent years and is mainly caused by human activities . <p> The Sunday Observer asked Family Physician , Ministry of Health , Dr Ramya L. Premaratne who has made an in-depth study of this subject to give us more insights into how and what causes extreme weather changes , and why it is necessary that we reduce greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 at the latest . <p> Excerpts : <p> Q. Over the past several years rising temperatures have posed a threat to the environment and wildlife , raising public concern . What are the main factors that contribute to this surge in global warming ? <p> A. There are several greenhouse gases responsible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ways . Greenhouse gas is a gas that absorbs and traps heat in the atmosphere and warms the planet . Types of Greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide , methane , nitrous oxide and industrial gases such as hydroflurocarbons , sulphur hexafluoride and nitrogen trifluoride . These gases mostly come from the combustion of fossil fuels in cars , factories , and power plants . The gas responsible for the most warming is carbon dioxide . Other contributors include methane released from landfills , petroleum industries and agriculture , nitrous oxide from fertilisers , gases used for refrigeration and industrial processes ; and the loss of forests that would release stored CO2 . Excess greenhouse gases can cause Earth 's atmosphere to absorb more and more heat , causing it to warm up . <p> Q. What is the rate of increase in land and ocean temperatures ? What has caused this spike ? <p> A. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of US ( NOAA ) , 2019 Global Climate Summary , the combined land and ocean temperature has increased at an average rate of 0.07 ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; however , the average rate of increase since 1981 ( 0.18 ? C / 0.32 ? F ) is more than twice as great according to the latest report dated August 14 , 2020 . <p> Causative factors vary , from human activity which has increased atmospheric CO2 concentration by 47% since the Industrial Revolution began . This is the most important long-lived climate change . Deforestation and burning fossil fuels is also a cause . Another reason is emission of nitrous oxide , another powerful greenhouse gas produced by soil cultivation practices , especially from the use of commercial and organic fertilisers , fossil fuel combustion , nitric acid production , and biomass burning . <p> Q. What is the impact of rising temperatures on humans ? <p> A. Rising temperatures create climate change that result in prolonged droughts and unseasonal floods . Physical and mental health problems can occur due to extremes in weather and temperature , increased pollution and environmental toxins . <p> World Health Organization ( WHO ) , researchers predict that certain effects of climate change will contribute to an increase of about 250,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as : heat stress , malnutrition , diarrhoea and malaria . Rising temperatures can also cause a wide range of severe health problems . All these factors can impact human health , including increased risk of infections , respiratory problems from smoke exposure , malnutrition and death . Prolonged exposure to extreme heat can also cause , heat strokes , muscle cramps and worsen existing living conditions of the poor . Natural disasters caused by extreme weather events can have drastic adverse effects on children and older adults in poor and marginalised communities . <p> Q. Effects on the elderly and the young ? <p> A. Heat stress from an increase in average temperatures can cause an increase in illness and death , particularly among the young , the elderly , the frail , and the ill , especially in large urban areas . Climate change will exacerbate an already large urban heat effect that exists in many large cities . Heat related mortality could be the largest direct health threat from global climate change including , extreme high temperature , light winds , high humidity , and intense solar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have not mentioned ? <p> A. Skin cancer , cataract , and immune suppression . Ozone depletion can have both direct and indirect effects on ecological systems and human health . The most important direct human health effect would be an increase in skin cancers , especially , in fair-skinned populations . <p> These natural hazards can cause direct loss of life or injury and affect health indirectly through loss of shelter ; population displacement ; contamination of water supplies ; loss of food production ( leading to hunger and malnutrition ) ; increased risk of infectious disease epidemics ( including diarrhoea and respiratory diseases ) ; and damage to infrastructure for provision of health . Increased temperatures also tend to expand the geographical range of malaria transmission . <p> In addition , due to depleted agriculture , live stock and fisheries industries from climate change , the food chain could affect the Food Production chain and thereby lead to a decline in nutritional health . It could affect the supply and quality of fresh water . Climate change may aggravate lack of access to clean and abundant drinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanitation . At present the WHO estimates more than one billion people worldwide to be without access to safe drinking water , and approximately 1.7 million premature deaths every year due to lack of safe drinking water and sanitation . <p> Q. What about diarrhoeal diseases due to shortage of water supply ? <p> A. Changes in surface water quality and quantity are likely to affect the incidence of diarrhoeal diseases . This group of diseases includes conditions caused by bacteria such as cholera and typhoid as well as parasitic diseases such as amoebiasis , giardiasis and cryptosporidium . Infections with cholera and typhoid bacteria are dependent on the concentration of the pathogens in water or food . Higher temperatures , changes in precipitation and climate variability would alter the geographical range and seasonality of transmission of many vector borne diseases . <p> Q. Can infectious diseases such as dengue and malaria also spike due to extreme climate changes ? <p> A. Heavy rainfall tends to overflow containers and can thus discourage vector breeding , while extended drought conditions have in some cases led to higher vector abundance due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind each play a role in determining the distribution and incidence of malaria . These factors govern the distribution , prevalence , rate of development , life span , and feeding frequency of the Anopheles mosquitoes . Temperature also plays a fundamental role in the rate of multiplication of the parasite in the mosquito . <p> Q. Anaemia ? Recent reports show many Lankans suffering from anaemia and malnutrition . <p> A. Yes . Anaemia caused by malnutrition is a major public health problem contributing to maternal and child morbidity and mortality . The cause for anaemia is iron deficiency due to lack of nutritious food intake by people . Usually this happens because of a decrease in food supply or the quality of food , and impacts mostly marginalised communities . <p> Q. Increased temperatures have also been linked to asthma and other respiratory problems . Do you agree ? <p> A. Yes . Since the respiratory surfaces are the primary route by which air pollutants enter the body , the activation of thermoregulatory responses at pulmonary level during prolonged heat exposure may augment the total intake of airborne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volumes . Temperature may also influence the interaction between allergens and air pollution in producing adverse respiratory effects since air pollution-related damage to the respiratory epithelium increases airway permeability stimulating allergen-induced responses and absorption of pollutants . Extreme heat could also lead to deaths due to cardiopulmonary causes . <p> Q. As Sri Lanka is in the midst of a Covid-19 outbreak , fears have been raised that the current extreme weather changes can increase the risk of people being exposed to this disease . Your comments ? <p> A. I do not think there is any direct connection between global warming and fast spreading of Covid-19 . <p> The reasons for spreading of Covid-19 are mainly due to the three Cs : <p> Crowded places with many people close to each other <p> Close-contact settings , especially where people have conversations close to each other <p> Confined and enclosed spaces with poor ventilation . <p> The risk of Covid-19 spreading is higher in places where these ' 3Cs ' overlap . <p> Q. Safe waste disposal of contaminated gloves , e-waste , face masks etc has been repeatedly emphasised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this . Is this good ? <p> A. This will regulate the disposal of medically and clinically hazardous waste . According to the interim guidelines prepared by the Health Ministry , waste and potentially contaminated items such as face masks , masks , gloves , handkerchiefs , tissues , sanitary pads , diapers , and other materials contaminated by body fluids should be collected in a leak-proof yellow colour HDPE ( minimum thickness of 25 microns or 100 gauge ) or LDPE ( minimum thickness of 55 microns or 250 gauge ) polythene bag . If a yellow bag is not available , a yellow colour plastic strip or a piece of cloth must be attached or tied enabling identification of the special waste bag from a distance . All waste containers/bags should be kept in a secure place outside the reach of children and animals until discharge or disposal . <p> Q. Lighting of fireworks is traditionally practised during festive seasons . However , this practice has been discouraged . With the upcoming festive season do you think this is a step in the right direction ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to be discouraged because it is beneficial health wise and would also reduce global warming . First , from the point of view of health , lighting of fireworks has to be discouraged because it emits hazardous air pollutants to the atmosphere . Fireworks cause extensive air pollution in a short amount of time , leaving metal particles , dangerous toxins , harmful chemicals and smoke in the air for hours and days . <p> Some of the toxins never fully decompose or disintegrate , but rather hang around in the environment , poisoning all they come into contact with . Exposure to fine particles , like those found in smoke and haze , is linked to negative health implications , such as coughing , wheezing , shortness of breath , asthma attacks and even heart attacks , according to the EPA . People at greatest risk are those with heart or lung disease , older adults and children . Secondly , it reduces excessive heat sent into the air . <p> Q. Have you a message with regard to reducing the negative impacts of global warming , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As human beings we share a collective responsibility to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 at the latest . We can do this by reducing vehicular emissions , stop burning of fires outside , using less firewood for cooking and using less heat raising devices inside our homes .

R Ashwin and Wriddhiman Saha were looked upon by their team to extend their stand and get India close to 300 . However , Ashwin fell first nicking Pat Cummins ' delivery in the first over of the day without adding to his overnight score . Saha , off the first ball he faced in the day , chased a wide one from Mitchell Starc to nick behind as well , thus kick-starting the collapse . A wildly swinging Umesh and less than comfortable Shami provided no resistance in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stark contrast with nightwatchman Jasprit Bumrah seeing out eleven balls and remaining unbeaten after Prithvi Shaw was bowled for the second time in the match to ensure that India 's advantage did not get dented any further . <h> Danushka Gunathilaka run out -- a bone of contention <p> Run outs over the years have played their part to decorate our beautiful game . There have been some famous ones ; Allan Donald being run out in Birmingham to deny South Africa a place in the 1999 World Cup final and Sir Don Bradman being left stranded on 299 after his batting partner -- Australia 's last man " Pud " Thurlow was run out in a Test match against South Africa in Adelaide in 1932 are just a few . The Lanka Premier League saw some high profile run outs as well . <p> Dambulla Viikings were knocked out in the semis by eventual champions Jaffna Stallions after their skipper Dasun Shanka attempted a cheeky single to short third man . Then in the final , the tournament 's highest run getter Danushka Gunathilaka was run out making several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the umpires could have done anything more to reinstate the batsman . <p> It has been a debate that has been widely discussed in cricket circles mainly because Galle Gladiators run chase was derailed soon after Gunathilaka 's departure and eventually it was an easy win for Jaffna Stallions . <p> The incident happened in the second over of the innings . Suranga Lakmal was bowling round the wicket to the left-handed batsman and he appealed for leg before wicket after Gunathilaka missed a flick shot to a full delivery . Lakmal had his back turned to the batsman as he was appealing and he had crossed onto the other side of the pitch -- the lane in which Gunathilaka was running . The batsman was running blind as well looking at the ball and the two collided . <p> Jaffna Stallions skipper Thisara Perera was cool as a cucumber . He collected the ball , sprinted to the non-striker 's end and threw the stumps down before Gunathilaka made it . <p> What happened was an unfortunate incident and there is no law in cricket where a batsman could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funny game they say . <p> It certainly was no obstruction . Lakmal simply did n't see Gunathilaka and vice-versa . <p> However , had Gunathilaka stood his ground after he collided with Lakmal and still if Perera had taken the bails off and appealed , then the umpires could have asked the question from the fielding side 's captain if he wanted to go ahead with the appeal . In most cases , captains withdraw their appeals . Thisara Perera would have probably done the same . <p> But the problem was Gunathilaka attempted to complete the run and therefore the umpires had Hobson 's Choice . Both on-field umpires -- Ruchira Palliyaguru and Kumar Dharmasena are International Cricket Council umpires and they are well equipped to deal with situations like these . <p> It was a shame that Gunathilaka had to go that way . Boy , what a tournament he had . His 476 runs came at an average of 60 and Strike Rate of 145 . No other batsman even managed to reach the 300 run mark in the competition . He is certainly going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ODIs as well in time to come . If only he can stay out of trouble , we are going to hear a lot more of Gunathilaka 's exploits soon . 
@@32436235 <h> LUMINOUS LIVES <p> Given his highly educated and widely travelled background it seems fitting that Dr. Rajiva Wijesinha should write a book on the lives of Sri Lankan ' Luminaries ' who have touched his life socially , politically and professionally . They are not in any way biographical records . They are intensely personal stories and have been based on the author 's intimate knowledge of his subjects . <p> The book can be read on many levels . Just reading for pleasure of course . But one realises that there is a sharply observant eye on the life of the ' luminaries ' he has chosen to honour . In many cases the reader might wonder if Rajiva has been a little too candid but herein lies its interest . Intimate tales that have never been heard before abound . One is fascinated to the end and hopes , of course , that no offence is taken . It is certainly not meant . <p> We have pictures painted with clear and deft brushstrokes . It helps that I personally knew many of Rajiva 's subjects . Diana Captain for instance . Also Yolande Abeywira , Neville Kanakaratne , Alfreda de Silva , Colvin de Silva , and several others in one way or another . All of them are personally important to the author ( and to ' Lakmahal ' ) yet while there is a great deal of warmth in the telling a certain detachment is sometimes felt . Not so in the last chapter on Lyn Weerasekera where Rajiva unstintingly gives praise . <p> It seems almost pre-ordained that Rajiva and I became friends . The first time I ever heard about him was when a character from his book , Civil Servant Cadiravel Mylvaganam , said to me one day , <p> " You are a Scrabble enthusiast are you not. ? " <p> " Just won a small tournament , " I boasted . <p> " Well you wo n't win so easily against this young genius I know , " said Myla naming Muktha Wijesinhe 's 10-year-old son who was apparently defeating anyone who dared challenge him . This was Rajiva . <p> It was many years before I actually met him and I certainly never played Scrabble with him , but when I DID get to know Rajiva I realized that Myla 's assessment of a young pre-teenaged ' genius ' had stood the test of time . It is an honour to write this review for the book of a true academic . <p> Rajiva 's choice of characters is particularly interesting . He writes affectionately and admiringly of Ena de Silva and this strikes a reminiscent chord in the minds of those like me who admired the artistic work and social commitment of this beguilingly beautiful woman . <p> It is not possible to comment on each person he portrays with such feeling and affection , although I was particularly moved by the chapter on Felix Dias Bandaranaike whom I never knew too well and always looked upon as being a trifle overbearing . But a politician who always smiles up at his wife who is sitting in the Gallery before making a speech , becomes lovable . Rajiva makes him lovable . <p> The brilliant Ministers Lalith , Gamini and Lakshman are a fascinating albeit doomed political trio . Richard de Zoysa , such an extraordinarily multifaceted personality , with a life tragically and needlessly cut short is another luminary . The reader weeps for the destroyed talent of Sri Lanka 's great sons . <p> Not many are aware of Rajiva 's close ties and work with the British Council . I personally know of this because he got together a group of teachers and Principals to help him write and publish books by the Council that would easily understandable by University students to whom English was a second language . I was one of this group which included Nirmali Wickremesinghe , Nirmali Hettiaratchi and others who were happy to be working with each other under Rajiva 's inspired vision . He approached his work with infectious enthusiasm . <p> " What fun this all is , " he would tell us if we showed signs of wilting . It actually was . <p> His affection and appreciation of the fine quality of men sent out by The British Council ( Rex Barker and Bill McAlpine ) followed by his disappointment with subsequent unedifying personal made Rajiva give up his close connections there . <p> Rajiva is a ' Politician ; ' -- not a Paliamentary table thumper of the ' House ' -- a variety so popular in Sri Lanka- but a knowledgeable member of the former Liberal Party and an academically motivated critic with an intimate personal knowledge of politicians and contemporary politics . His family relationship to political figures and their friendship with the kingmakers and other VIPs of the time , have given him a front row seat in viewing them in person . He makes full use of this personal knowledge of the ' Luminaries ' in his book . <p> Coming as he does from one of Colombo 's elite and affluent families , I was somewhat surprised to read his remarks that he off and on found himself short of funds . " How come ? " I asked him . " After all you only had to ask your parents ? " Rajiva is sometimes an exponent of the understatement . <p> His friends encompass Colombo 's litterati and glitterati as the widely ranging ' Luminaries ' of Lakmahal will show but I can not end without commenting on the two ' Luminaries ' he has left out -- his own mother and father , Sam and Muktha Wijesinha -- both famous in their own right . He tells me , however , that he could never have done justice to these two people -- his exceptionally popular and wonderful parents . He has left it to me to make up for his omission . Let me add their names to his list of Luminaries and say that in the minds of many readers THEY should have headed it . <p> One tends to re-read sections of this book and this takes time . The variety of characters discussed in its pages are going to give readers unexpected views of well known personalities . All this adds up to a thorough enjoyment of Rajiva 's account of ' Luminous Lives ' . It is a totally riveting read . <h> What will we do when locusts come ? <p> The Bible warns that the end of the world , or the apocalypse , will be heralded by fires , floods and locusts . <p> Locusts are a group of short-horned grasshoppers that migrate long distances in swarms , crossing over many countries . They devour leaves , flowers , fruits , seeds , bark , and destroy plants by their sheer weight as they descend on them in massive numbers . <p> The desert locust is regarded as the most destructive pest in the world . Adult locust swarms can fly up to 150 km a day with the wind and adult insects can consume roughly their own weight in fresh food per day . <p> The rains in Iran and Yemen were heavy last year , and millions of insects were born and flew , from these countries , over Saudi Arabia , landing in the eastern region of Pakistan in February , destroying the crops of cotton , wheat and maize . Their flying army was so large and so rapacious that Pakistan declared a national emergency . Crops were sprayed from the air and the armed forces and district administrations pressed into service . From there they came into India : Gujarat , Rajasthan and Punjab . <p> At the same time locusts were decimating crops , trees and pastureland in East Africa . A 2,400 square kilometre swarm of 360 billion insects was measured in Kenya in January , large enough to consume as much food in a single day as 85 million people . Somalia declared a national emergency . The UN warned that the locust attack on Ethiopia , Kenya and Somalia would result in a humanitarian crisis -- meaning that everyone in the country would again have to be fed by world aid . 14 countries were affected . While UN 's Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) has described the 2019-2020 locus attack as the worst in Kenya in 70 years , they are expecting it to be worse in 2021 and every year after that . <p> Dozens of countries have been hit . Sardinia , a little Italian island has had its worst disaster in 60 years . The crop of 2019-20 is almost all gone and what the island is left with are carpets of locusts : the reason is the unseasonal rains of 2018 . Bolivia in Latin America has declared a state of emergency in response to a locust plague that is destroying crops of corn , sorghum , beans and pastures . <p> The outbreak in India started in mid-2019 . The locusts came for the rapeseed and cumin crops . We claimed that we had brought them under control , but then we claim success in every field all the time . The truth was that thousands of acres ( over 360,000 in Rajasthan alone ) were decimated . They came in waves again in December to February , the worst attack we have ever had . Fields of mustard , cumin and wheat were devastated in the two states . <p> In India , the extended monsoon provided a favourable environment for the locusts to multiply . Each locust lays about 150 eggs in moist soil . Experts are expecting a huge increase when the next generation hatches in June . A million locusts can eat the food of 35,000 people in one day . When they destroy the pastureland , the animals grown for meat and milk also starve . For countries and tribes that depend on livestock , the effect is as devastating . In a few hours a farm growing vegetables and grain becomes a desert . <p> Why are the locusts thriving ? About 93% of the heat generated from global warming has been absorbed by the oceans , and , according to the Journal of Climate , the western part of the Indian Ocean has heated faster than any other part of the tropical oceans . Called the Indian Ocean Dipole ( IOD ) , the waters closest to Africa are warmer than those near Australia . The warm moist air blowing westwards brings rain to East Africa and drought to Australia . Australia is now ravaged with fires and dust storms , while countries such as Kenya , Somalia and Ethiopia have moved from droughts to floods , and this wetness is hospitable to desert locusts . It increases the amount of vegetation that swarms feed on and moistens the soil , improving breeding conditions for locusts , which avoid laying eggs in dry soil . <p> Are any scientists in India working on a sustainable way to get rid of them when they come ? Unchecked locust plagues will take years to control and at a cost of hundreds of crores , threaten hunger , particularly in regions struggling with food security . <p> Who can fight a plague of locusts ? How do you chase them away ? With torches of fire ? Shooting in the air , waving sticks , banging cans and running around ? Small planes spraying pesticide ? I think not . You may drive the locusts away but the crop is poisoned . The government of India deploys teams to control locust swarms , which spray deadly organophosphate chemicals in small , concentrated doses . This will continue to kill people long after the locusts have been killed . <p> India has a locust department in the agriculture ministry of each state . But , since the last locust attack was a small one in 1993 , the department is flabbier and idler than most . What have the officials of this department done in the last 25 years ? They have been on international jaunts to discuss the potential danger of locust invasions . What did they do when an invasion really happened ? Leave it to the farmers to bang utensils to scare them away . <p> Oh , yes ... spray the most poisonous chemicals known to man -- and , of course , blame Pakistan saying it failed to conduct control operations successfully . <p> There have to be some sensible ways to protect this country . <p> All locust-affected countries transmit data about attacks to the FAO , which analyses the data and weather patterns and provides forecasts for locust attacks up to six weeks in advance to each country . So there is time for the country to take precautions . <p> What can the government and farmers do when the locusts come again ? <p> Here are two solutions from Padma Shri awardee Chintala Venkata Reddy , an organic farmer from Telangana : <p> 1 . Spraying a concoction of linseed oil , edible soda/sodium bicarbonate and extracts of garlic , cumin and orange . This mixture has no side effects on crops . <p> 2 . Take 30-40 kg of sub-soil , from four feet below the earth , and dissolve it in 200 litres of water and allowing it to rest for 10-20 minutes . The sieved water should be then filtered and sprayed on the crops . This will make all the vegetation inedible for locusts . This sand-water can be sprayed with a normal spray pump . After the locust threat is over , spraying the crop with plain water will remove the sand layer from the leaves . <p> 3 . Chris Adriaansen , director of the , Australian Plague Locust Commission , has suggested a biological agent , based on a naturally occurring fungus in 1976 . It is based on the spores of the metarhizium fungus . Once sprayed onto locusts it attaches and germinates , stopping the insects from feeding and reproducing . <p> Green Muscle is a bio-pesticide developed by the International Institute for Tropical Agriculture 's biological control centre in Benin . It contains spores of the naturally occurring fungus Metarhizium anisopliae var. acridum , which destroys the locust 's tissues from the inside . The fungus has no effect on other life forms . <p> 4 . Locusts are attracted to green colours . Covering crops with mesh of a different colour might help smaller farmers . <p> 5 . Research at the International Centre for Insect Physiology and Ecology ( ICIPE ) , in Nairobi , has identified and synthesized a specific locust pheromone , or chemical signal , that can be used against young locusts . <p> 6 . A team of German researchers , headed by Frithjof Voss , have devised an electrical grid powered by a portable generator , run by a 12-volt solar cell powered battery , to frighten off locusts . At the heart of the grid is a four-meter long by half-a-meter high net which is dragged manually across the field . Vibrations created by the wire net frighten off the insects , and those which come too close are immediately electrocuted . This technology is much safer for the environment than pesticides . There is only a one-time cost with the initial purchase of the equipment . The grid can be used by individual farmers , who can install it across their fields whenever necessary . <p> 7 . The first and most important activity is to locate and destroy the locusts ' eggs in an organised manner , by ploughing , harrowing and digging . Digging 2 ' x 2 ' trenches around egg-laid areas will help entrap the nymphs , which are the flightless young of the locusts . As they move out after hatching , they are buried . Another is to keep ducks to control locust infestations . Each duck can eat as many as 200 locusts per day . <p> Since we receive information well in time about locust swarms -- unlike demonetization and lockdowns -- it is possible to take action , like arranging for noise , placing 50-foot high traps in the way of the swarm , or scattering the swarms by flying airplanes through them . <p> No one in the Indian government is still taking climate change seriously . There is only lip service at conferences by politicians and bureaucrats , plus a few attempts at solar energy generation . That 's it . But our methane production has increased -- more cattle being grown for milk and meat and export . More coal is being used for electricity , more rice production . Methane is 24 times more dangerous than carbon dioxide . <p> Extreme weather events , such as heat waves , droughts , cyclones and floods , are set to become stronger without sharp cuts to greenhouse gas emissions . So the skies will blacken and the locusts will come . <p> The Bible warns that the end of the world , or the apocalypse , will be heralded by fires , floods and locusts . <h> A Tribute to Sir Ivor Jennings <p> Today , 19th of December 2020 , marks the 55th anniversary of the passing away of Sir Ivor Jennings , the founder Vice Chancellor of the University of Ceylon and thereby the University system in Sri Lanka and this article is written to commemorate his memory . <p> " The man who put Peradeniya on the map of the academic world " is how the distinguished Sri Lankan Bibliographer , H.A.I. ( Ian ) Goonetilleke described Sir Ivor Jennings in the concluding lines of the Introduction he wrote to Sir Ivor 's autobiography The Road to Peradeniya , when it was published posthumously in 2005 . Formerly Peradeniya was known to students of history as the home of one Konappu Bandara who , as the 18th cen . Chronicle Rajavaliya records , by his superb military skills and adroit political maneouvers , overcame the formidable hostilities of both Sitawaka Rajasinghe and the Portuguese and ascended the throne of Senkadagaka Pura as Wimala Dhararmasuriya , to found the dynasty which was to rule till 1815 . Our story which gives Peradeniya its present recognition as the site of the largest and most prestigious university in the island , may not be as dramatic as that of the founding of the last Sinhala dynasty . But the energy , steadfastness of resolve and the vision of one single individual stands out in this narration of the founding of the first national university in the island . <p> University College <p> Patriots in colonial Sri Lanka had been agitating for some time for the establishment of a university . Starting with Calcutta and Madras ( as they were known then ) in 1857 , India obtained , by the year 1900 , several universities in various parts of the British Raj . In Sri Lanka the agitation was finally mobilized in 1906 into The Ceylon University Association which held public meetings and published a journal . Their representations were met in positive terms by some British authorities such as the Governor Sir Robert Chalmers ( 1913-16 ) . There was a general consensus that the island should first get a " university college " affiliated to a British university . After the delays caused by the First World War , the Ceylon University College was opened on 1st January 1921 as an affiliate of the University of London . There were " Arts " and " Science " subjects taught there in this College with their curricula being obtained from London . Most of the teachers were expatriates ( except those in the " Oriental " subjects ) . The subjects taught were English , Latin and Greek , European History with Economics , Western Philosophy , Mathematics , Sanskrit , Pali , Sinhalese , Tamil , Chemistry , Botany and Physics . The students sat for the London examinations which culminated in obtaining a London B.A. or B.Sc .. As could be expected the medium of teaching was English , even Sanskrit , Pali , Sinhala and Tamil being taught in that medium . Furthermore , Sanskrit , Pali and Sinhala were grouped in one department of study , which was eventually called Indo-Aryan . That department and Tamil did not get Professorships and were placed under ' lecturers in charge ' . It is noteworthy that the aspirations of those who agitated for a Ceylon University were far from being fulfilled by this arrangement . Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam had expressed the hope that in the university they expected to establish " our youth will learn to use their mother tongue with accuracy and ease ( and also learn ) to appreciate the beauties of their classical languages and literatures and to realize that they are inheritors of a great past stretching back to 24 centuries ( " A Plea for a Ceylon University " , Journal of the Ceylon University Association , vol . I No.1 , 1906 ) . As placed on record by one of the students of the College in the 1930 's , it had " a colonialist culture and imperialistic atmosphere " ( Ediriweera Sarchcnandra , Pin Ethi Sarasavi Waramak Denne , 1985 , p. 52 ) . Perhaps one reason for that kind of atmosphere to prevail was the attitude of the Principal , Robert Marrs , " rabid imperialist " ( ugra adhirajyavadiyek ) according to Sarachcnadra ( op. cit. p. 73 ) , who held that post for twenty years of its twenty one year existence . William Ivor Jennings , was appointed the second Principal of the University College in 1941 and his assignment was to establish " The University of Ceylon " . Originally when his appointment came , Jennings was not aware that in fact he had two jobs to do . One was the creation of a university in Colombo and the second was moving it to a new campus which was still to be built in Peradeniya ( Peradeniya : The Founding of a University ed . ( A.T.Alwisvol.I , p.237 ) . <p> William Ivor Jennings ( 1903-65 ) , former lecturer in the prestigious London School of Economics , Reader in the University of London , who had taught at the University of Leeds and University of Cambridge , in the University of British Columbia ( Canada ) and in several universities in the US , who had earned the B.A. ; Ll.B . ; M.A. and the Ll.D . He held the high academic reputation of being the author of The Law and the Constitution(1933) , Cabinet Government ( 1936 ) and The Parliament ( 1939 ) which according to Goonetilleke had become " classics in the field . " When he arrived in Colombo in March 1941 he was just 38 , an age in which it was possible to engage in hard work . He says about his job : <p> " It had not been a ' nine to four job ' . Quite often it had been not only nine to four p.m. but also four to nine p.m. and even four to nine a.m . " ( The Road to Peradeniya p. 191 ) <p> Such was the work load of the founder Vice Chancellor . <p> The " founding of a University " proved to be a massive job . As Ian Goonetilleke observes in his Introduction to Sir Ivor 's other posthumous publication The Kandy Road , it was a matter of " building from scratch by the banks of ... the river ( Mahaveli ) an academic grove in the true sense of the term " This unenviable task began in Thurstan Road , where he assumed duties on March 24th , 1941 . When he stepped into the " CUC , he found that it did not have " a university atmosphere . " The College was a " government department controlled by a Principal , who was responsible to the Executive Committee of Education ... a body of seven politicians " ( The Road to Peradeniya , p.111 ) .. In creating the university , Jennings had two tasks to accomplish . One , which he believed in fervently was university autonomy and academic freedom . The other , which also he believed in with equal intensity was establishing good university standards , specifically in the award of Degrees . <p> University Autono <p> my <p> The University Commission of 1927 , chaired by Sir Walter Buchanan-Riddell ( the Chairman of the UGC of Great Britain ) had proposed that the university to be established should be " unitary , autonomous and residential " . This as the normal British practice . But before coming to Sri Lanka , Jennings had been warned that no politician would like being deprived of the powers of control they had been enjoying . " The Ceylonese politicians were unusually difficult , " he was told ( op. cit. p112 ) There is one such incident on record . A member of the Executive Committee had proposed that there should be " more control over the university by the government , " to which Jennings responded with " The proposal to place the university under political control is abhorrent to anyone who has taught in a university " ( Quoted in Amal Jayawardene . " Jennings on University Education , " in R. A. L. H.Gunawardena , ed . More Open than Usual ) . Jennings seems to have been fully aware of the possibilities when the Ceylon University Ordinance no. 20 of 1942 was placed before the State Council In March 1942 . The danger of tampering with it was in the Committee stage after the Second Reading . Jennings records in his autobiography how he sat in the seat assigned to officers watching the proceedings . " I had fought serious limitations , " he wrote " with the knowledge -- which I did not share ... - that if any serious limitations on autonomy were inserted , I should send in my resignation " ( RP , p118 ) . <p> What Jennings meant by " University autonomy " needs explanation . It was not a simple arrangement where the powers so far wielded by " seven politicians " being vested in one University officer , i.e. the Vice Chancellor . Specifically those powers were divided into two areas , administrative and academic . Academic activities would be under the control of the Senate which would basically consist of senior academics and administrative activities will be under the purview of the Council , which will consist of the Deans of Faculties and members drawn from the public . The Vice Chancellor will preside at meetings of the Senate and Council and therefore will have considerable power and influence on all activities of the University but he is constrained from using absolute powers . Thus the principles governing University activities are liberal and democratic . During his office as Vice Chancellor Jennings had to face occasions when autonomy and academic freedom were put on test . For example , in the aftermath of the Hartal of 1953 Prime Minister Sir John Kotelawala writing to Jennings , expressed his concern about the growth of " Communism " and asked for advice on how to control its spread in the University . Kotelawala was suggesting a kind of political control over student and staff activities in the university . Jennings wrote back : " political control of a university is most undesirable ... There are inherent dangers in a political control .... The first step of any dictatorship is to ' purge the universities ' because they are the bastions of freedom . Ought not a Democratic Government uphold and strengthen those bastions ? " ( Q. in Amal Jayawardene , op. cit . ) . Furthermore , with his wide experience in the study of politics he warned the Prime Minister that " If political control was introduced by this Government it would in due course be exercised by this Government 's successors . " ( op cit . ) <p> National Culture <p> A lot of people refer to Sir Ivor as " the man who called this country a cultural desert . " There is controversy as to whether he said so at all . He has denied it . ( RP , p. 190 ) Jennings as we all know was no coward and he had no need to please anybody . <p> He has stated that " The story that I described Ceylon as a ' cultural desert ' is historically as accurate as the story of Alfred and the burnt cakes or a good many of the stories in the Mahavamsa . " ( Q. by Ian Goonetilleke in the Introduction to The Kandy Road ) . In my view what should concerns us at presentis not what Jennings is supposed to have said butwhat he has done in the University concerning the national cultural heritage . Firstly , I refer to a letter Jennings wrote on 12 August 1941 addressed to the Minister of Education and the Executive Committee on Education who at the time could decide on the structure of the new university that was to be established .. The topic was " Chair of Sanskrit " . Proposing that " a Professor of Sanskrit at this stage would necessarily be a non-Ceylonese ... a scholar of great repute and ripe experience who could not only develop Sanskrit studies in the island but also train a Ceylonese to succeed him " ( Peradeniya : The Founding of a University , vol.5 , pp. 303 -4 ) These sentiments indicate his genuine concern for the development of Sanskrit studies in the new university . In the same letter he speaks of how such a scholar would " add a great impetus to the study of Oriental subjects ... and bring kudos ... not only in Ceylon but outside " . This letter indicates Jennings ' policy in recruitments to Professorships in the university he was building . We should have the best possible because , as we know from experience , the academic reputation of a Professor would affect the Department 's standing and , future recruitments will depend on his/her good judgment . As an aside , I am tempted to mention an anecdote concerning Lord Milner , the Viceroy of India who is alleged to have made a statement about some " shoddy universities " in that country , becoming so , due in a large measure , to " wrong recruitments . " This was a finding of The Curzon Committee which examined the low standards of those universities and Jennings would not have been unaware of it . <p> Oriental Studies <p> A more important and far reaching proposal of Jennings in the letter of 12 August was about " the need for a Faculty of Oriental Studies . " This was a magnificent move as far as the " Oriental subjects " Sinhala , Pali , Sanskrit and Tamil , were concerned . Thereby these subjects got a developmental boost that we should not fail to appreciate . This is particularly true with regard to the two national languages Sinhala and Tamil as will be described below . They had been rather neglected or relegated to " second class status " in the University College . With his wide experience in university affairs Jennings pointed to " the lack of sufficient powers for the effective teaching of Oriental subjects " and hence proposed the creation of a separate Faculty where they would have independence to develop on their own . No doubt he saw that with the privileged position enjoyed by English and Social Science subjects such as History and Economics the " Oriental " subjects would again receive " step-motherly " treatment in a common Faculty of Arts . When the faculty of Oriental Studies was established in 1942 , it was accorded primacy of status in the faculty hierarchy . <p> A little known fact about the creation of separate Departments of Sinhala , Pali Sanskrit and Tamil needs mention here . The seniormost academic in the field of Oriental Studies , Dr. G.P.Malalasekera while expressing his happiness that " Orientalia " would be receiving its due place in the proposed university added that " if someone with courage and vision had done this when the University College was inaugurated , the position of ' Oriental ' Studies in the country would be very much different from what it now is " . As for the composition of the new Faculty Dr. Malalasekera proposed that it should " start with two Departments , viz. the Department of Indo-Aryan Studies and the Department of Dravidian Studies . " Next , in this letter dated 24 September 1941 , he deals at length with three main topics : suggesting Dr. Kanapathipillai 's name as the most suitable to head the Department of Dravidian Studies , the possibility of getting a Sanskritist of high reputation from one of the good Indian universities and , suggesting that he ( Malalasekera ) be sent to India on a study tour to get a close look at how the Indian universities are coping with problems of development so that such examples could be adopted in our university ( PFU , vol 5 , pp309 -311 ) It needs mention that none of these proposals were adopted . <p> Sinhalese , Tamil , Pali and Sanskrit were instituted as separate Departments of Study within the Faculty of Oriental Studies in the new University . To this was added a Department of Arabic . For the Chair of Sanskrit Dr. Betty Heimann ( Ph.D . Halle ) who had been teaching at the School of Oriental and African Studies was selected . She had a great international reputation not only as a Sanskritist but also as an authority on Indian Philosophy . Being advanced in age she worked as Professor of Sanskrit only for five years , but when she retired in 1949 , by her energy , skill and diligence she had increased the number of students in the Sanskrit Special Degree class from 5 to 27 ( Ratna Handurukande , " Orientalia in the University , " Sri Lanka Journal of Humanities , , 1994 ) . For the Chair of Tamil , Swami Vipulananda ( B.Sc . Lond ; Pundit of Madurai Tamil Sangam ) who had been the Professor of Tamil at Annamalai University in South India and as a scholar highly recognized for his creative and critical writings and for his translations , was selected . For the Chair of Sinhala , again a scholar , teaching at SOAS , London at the time , M.D.Ratnasuriya ( B.A. ; Ph.D . Lond ) was invited . The Chair of Pali of course was assigned to G.P.Malalasekera ( B.A. ; M.A. ; Ph.D. ; D.Litt . Lond ) . Furthermore , according to a decision taken by Jennings the Sinhalese Etymological Dictionary Project was also placed under the Dept. of Sinhalese , the Dictionary staff becoming part of the Faculty . <p> We referred to the steps taken by Sir Ivor to appoint the best possible academics to head the Departments of Study in the Faculty of Oriental Studies . Similar care was taken with regard to professorial appointments in other Faculties as well . Thus we find the American Bryce Ryan in Sociology , the Indian D.B.Das Gupta in Economics and so on . All these steps were part and parcel of the grand design to establish a good university which could stand on par with the best universities in the world . " You may rest assured , " Jennings said in his farewell address to the country broadcast over Radio Ceylon on 20 Jan . 1955 , " that as far as examination standards are concerned a graduate of the University of Ceylon is as good as a graduate of any western university " ( PFU , pvol . I , p.236 ) How was this achieved ? Writes Emeritus Professor G.H. Pieris , " In the Arts disciplines ... while not adopting a rigorous schedule of formal classroom work , laid stress on student initiative , especially in he use of the library . It was stringent in the award of ' class ' degrees . It also followed several other quality safeguards such as the continuing employment of expatriate teaching staff , caution in the recruitment of new staff and obtaining the services of reputed foreign academicians -- generally British -- for moderation of examination question papers and the second marking of answer scripts . English remained the only medium of instruction " ( G.H. Pieris , " The Faculties of Arts and Oriental Studies at Peradeniya , " in K.M de Silva and G.H.Pieris ed . The University System of Sri Lanka , pp.110-29 ) <p> Efflorescence <p> Going back to the " cultural desert " remark , Goonetilleke records that Jennings thought of " Thurstan Road as an oasis " He was eagerly awaiting the transfer to Peradeniya where " the desert would blossom like the rose " ( KR , Intro . Xxiii ) . As we all know it did indeed . ( Let us leave aside the " cultural desert " part . ) . Being empowered to " develop " in a separate Faculty , Sinhalese , Tamil , Pali and Sanskrit studies expanded their academic vistas . I think the most momentous development was in the Department of Sinhalese . In Peradeniya , it had come under a new Professor and Head of Department , D.E.Hettiarachchi ( B.A. ; Ph.D . Lond ; M.A. ; Ph.D . Calcutta ) The study of modern Sinhala literature was added to the curriculum of the Department enlisting the services of Ediriweera Sarachcnadra , a scholar who had been making pioneering studies on modern Sinhala literature , getting him transferred from the Department of Pali . This proved to be the most appropriate choice . For , Sarachcandra by his critical writings , not only guided the course of new developments in the art of the novel , short story and poetry , but also became " the father of modern Sinhala drama " in the years to come , producing the monumental ' Maname ' in 1956 . His research interests were wide and varied . In 1952 he brought out the book The Sinhalese Folk Play , described by the Times of London , Literary Supplement as " the most interesting , indeed unique , account of the many phases of drama in Ceylon ... is so wide in scope that it must surely interest all who wish to trace the development of dramatic forms " ( Q. in J.B.Disanayaka , " Sarachchandra the trail-blazer " , The Birth Centenary of Sarachcandra , Ministry of Cultural Affairs , 2014 ) Apart from literature the Department expanded its academic concerns to various branches of Socio-cultural Studies as for example in the research done by M.B.Ariyapala and P.E.Fernando . In the ' fifties young scholars were trained in various foreign universities in new areas of research : M.W. Sugathapala De Silva ( structural linguistics ) Hemapala Wijayawardhana ( Sanskrit aesthetics ) Ariya Rajakaruna ( Theatre and Cinema ) . <p> Similar expansion of vistas was noted in the Department of Tamil as well . The first Professor of Tamil Swami Vipulananda had a very progressive outlook which set the tone for Tamil scholarship in Sri Lanka taking an independent course of development which was in marked contrast to the traditionalism which characterized Tamil studies in Tamilnadu . Vipulananda is on record as being the " first Tamil Professor to recognize the spoken Tamil dialects " ( M.A.Nuhuman , " The University of Peradeniya and the Development of Tamil Literary Criticism " in R.A.L.H.Gunawardene ed , pp.185-98 ) Among the other academics , it is noted that venturing into newer fields of research had been inaugurated by K.Kanapathipillai who wrote his doctoral dissertation on the Tamil Inscriptions of Sri Lanka . In the late ' forties and the fifties ' several others took his lead in pursuing linguistic studies . For example , A Velupillai who worked on Tamil Inscriptions , S.Thanajayarajasinham who studied the Tamil documents during the Dutch period and A.Shanmugadas who made a linguistic study of the Jaffna Tamil dialect . The more striking departure from the South Indian tradition was noted in the field of literary criticism . In South India , traditionalism was so strong in the academia that in the early days " modern literature and literary criticism were excluded from the curriculum in ... the universities and Colleges . " ( Nuhuman ) In Sri Lanka , on the other hand , the study of modern literature was undertaken because of the progressive attitudes of the first Professor and his juniors , notably Dr. K.Kanapathipilla , who took the revolutionary step of writing plays in the colloquial dialect . The progressive Tamil academics in Sri Lanka forged ahead and it was later recognized that as far as in the field of literary criticism , Sri Lanka was ahead of Tamilnadu ( Nuhuman , op. cit . ) . The outstanding scholar in the field of literary history and literary criticism in Tamil was V.Chelvanayagam who approached literature in a social , political and historical perspective . His pioneering studies had not been superseded . ( Nuhuman , op.cit . ) <p> In illustrating the great impetus received by the academic departments in the Oriental Studies during the early years of the Peradeniya period I have described only the case of the two modern languages , Sinhala and Tamil . Similar expansion in academic vistas could be seen in the case of the two classical language departments Pali and Sanskrit . The point that has to be made is that these two national languages were able to expand their academic vistas because of the recognition they received in the University of Ceylon . The pre-eminent position enjoyed by the Humanities studies in the University of the 1950 ' and " 60 's is best summed up by the Geographer Prof. G.H.Pieris , " in the Faculties of Arts and Oriental Studies ... academic disciplines concerned with historical , linguistic and aesthetic occupied centre stage while the so-called social sciences Economics , Sociology geography etc ...... maintaining a relatively low profile " ( Pieris , op.cit . ) <p> Historical Heritage <p> Talking of the country 's cultural heritage , Jennings in 1950 , pays a tribute to the work done by Bell , Codrington John Still and Paranavitana ( RP , p168 ) . He mentions that the University had taken the necessary steps to make that knowledge available to the undergraduates and graduates . But he saw that a lot more had to be done . With his vision for a University Museum where our history could be studied more intimately , he was hoping that the facility would eventually be provided in Peradeniya . He was engaged in a " battle " to get that established and the Archives ( then in Nuwara Eliya ) shifted there so that the whole complex would be a " convenient centre for research scholars " Ibid ) . We know that these things did not happen . But his vision for the study of our national heritage should be appreciated . Much more significant , as far as vision becoming reality is concerned , was Jenning 's proposal in the Senate that the University should undertake the job of writing " a comprehensive History of Ceylon " . ( The Preface to pt. 1 , vol.I by Sir Nicholas Attygalle , Chairman Editorial Board ) . People who have watched the progress of this massive project are aware of the trials and tribulations through which it went until it was completed in 1995 . But what needs mention is that it was again Sir Ivor Jennings who took the initiative in launching the project . <p> We mentioned earlier about the Museum . It was in fact a museum cum art gallery he had in mind . Sir Ivor established The Arts Council of the university to sponsor artistic activities which he thought was an essential part of education , " the training of the emotions " as he saw it . One of the first acts of the Arts Council was an Exhibition of paintings by George Keyt , a denizen of Kandy who had achieved international fame . From the proceeds of the exhibition Sir Ivor bought the painting titled " The Offering " by Keyt which was to be the first item in a collection which would form the exhibits of the envisaged Art Gallery . Jennings is said to have established the " Peradeniya Fund " vested in the Vice Chancellor " intended to enhance the beauty of the University Park and its environs " . ( H.A.I.G . , Intro . KR p.xiv ) and he had hoped that contributions " would flow in like the Great Sandy River " . In 1953 its balance was Rs. 50 . " perhaps the author 's own initial contribution " . And in 1956 it stood at Rs. 146.49 and the university authorities decided to close down the Fund and remit the balance to the General Fund ( Ibid . ) In the last pages of his autobiography Jennings wrote about the various Endowments the University had received during the first eight years . He added in the end " the endowment nearest my heart , however , is the Peradeniya Fund which caused this book to be written " . The proceeds from the sale of the book , The Road to Peradeniya was to go to that fund . It was his hope that the proceeds of the Fund would enable the University not only to enhance the physical beauty of the University Park but also to purchase works of art to be exhibited in the Museum cum art gallery that was to come up . The following are the last words in the autobiography : " By writing this book I have made a small contribution . History will say that it was small indeed . But at least my name will appear among the thousands of benefactors listed in the Calendar of the year 2950 " ( RP , pp201 -2 ) . There is no need to comment on the above facts . <p> Integrity <p> The education of the two daughters of the Jennings family , Claire and Shirley was disrupted due to the war and their father 's departure to Ceylon in 1941 . When the family got together finally in Ceylon , Shirley was educated in South India and later in Melbourne in Australia where she married a lecturer in the university . Claire 's education was haphazard . She worked as a journalist in Colombo and in 1952 , asked her father whether she could join the university of Ceylon . His immediate retort was " you are not intelligent enough . " When they went back to England , years later , Claire passed the necessary exams and entered the university of Cambridge , graduating six before her father passed away . This story communicated to Ian Goonatilleke by Claire appears in his introduction to RP ( p.xiii ) . <p> In coming to the end of this tribute , I would like to quote Ian Goonatilleke again . <p> " The very title of his autobiography , the cast of its content and the fact that he made no attempt to extend its coverage into his later illustrious years may well be regarded as further pointers to his single-minded resolve to place Peradeniya on the academic map of the world- the shining peak he had set himself to scale " ( intro too KR , p.xxii ) <p> To conclude , I would like to place on record the salutary steps taken by the present Vice Chancellor , Prof. Upul B. Dissanayake to erect a bronze statue of Sir Ivor Jennings in a prominent place on the campus . Future generations of university students who have never heard of this great academic will at least get a fleeting impression of him and hopefully be inspired to discover more about the founder Vice Chancellor of the university . <h> Towards a new realism , or why American interventionism fails <p> In hindsight the interventionists got it wrong : they relied too much on the middle-classes , the civil societies , and the potential for permanent democracy in the countries they intervened in . After four years of entertaining doubts about interventionism , Condoleezza Rice argued , " A rising middle class also creates new centres of social power for political movements . " Today the middle-class in the Third World continues to grow and civil society continues to flourish . Yet democracy , apart from a roller-coaster ride of regime change which never seems to end and always produces electoral backlashes against it , has not . How come ? <p> Charles Krauthammer called the US a " commercial republic . " If it is a commercial republic , it probably is the only one operating in a political system run by an oligarchy , maintained by an upper middle-class , tolerated by a lower middle-class , and suffered by a working class . In this it surpasses not only Athens , but also the European Powers . <p> What Clinton humanitarians and Bush realists failed to realise was that the rest of the world , barring Western Europe and South-East Asia , does not fit this description : we not only are averse to democracy maintained by a middle-class , we also do n't buy it . Joe Biden may write that " the world does not organize itself " and that for 70 years the US " played a leading role in ... animating the institutions that guide relations among nations . " Yet 70 years have ended in the present . Now is not 70 years back . Now is now . The world does not let one country , let alone one superpower , organise everything . The world does not wait . <p> In trying to intervene and imposing democracy , America hence strove to create an order in its image . " We 'll win hearts and minds " , ran the refrain when US forces pulled down Saddam Hussein 's statue in Firdos Square in April 2003 . On the eve of the invasion a Congresswoman went on television and declared , " We 'll go in there , take out Saddam , destroy his army with clean surgical strikes , and everyone will think it 's great . " A year earlier , Dick Cheney made his case for regime change quoting Washington 's favourite Arab expert Fouad Ajami , who apparently believed Iraq would " erupt in joy in the same way the throngs in Kabul greeted the Americans . " But then the throngs did n't greet the Americans in Kabul . They were n't going to do so in Basra . What resulted from these interventions was an aberration . <p> US foreign policy has always been guided by national interest . Only once did it enjoy the status of a sole superpower , and that was between 1991 and 2001 . Two camps surveying the world came up with two conclusions about the role of the US in the world order then : the end of history theorists and the clash of civilisations theorists . <p> The fall of the Soviet Union , which was less the work of Reagan Republicans and Thatcherite Conservatives than of Brezhnev 's entrenchment of the Nomenklatura and its contradictions with a supposedly egalitarian Communist state , was followed by **27;842;TOOLONG uprisings outside the West . Yet in the aftermath of Soviet collapse , the US gained supremacy . There was no one to challenge it . Not even Islamic fundamentalism . <p> The reaction in America was , as Charles Krauthammer put it , first of confusion , then of awe . Even so not all political pundits felt or believed that America should take over the rule of the world : the isolationists , or the paleoconservatives as they were to be called later , wanted out . But then this was not the time of the paleoconservatives : that would come a quarter century later with the Tea Party Movement , Steve Bannon , and Donald Trump . <p> In the meantime , civilisation-states propped up their struggle for regional hegemony with one another : Japanese and Chinese in East Asia , Buddhists and Hindus ( or rather Sinhalese and Tamils : the clash of civilisations theorists always get it wrong with South Asia ) in Sri Lanka . Yet in the absence of a counterweight , the US attempted to carpet the world with the kind of order it had wanted to impose for over half a century . What resulted was the suppression of nationalism on the one hand and the frothing of nationalist tensions on the other . <p> Accompanying all this was a shift to the neoliberal right by political parties associated with the left or the left-of-centre : the Democrats in the US , the Labourites in the UK , the Congress in India , and of course the SLFP in Sri Lanka . Underlying them was one simple , undeniable fact : for the first time since the beginning of it all , a disparity of power put one country at the helm of the world . " There is no comparison , " Paul Kennedy famously observed . <p> I 've observed that American foreign policy has always been driven by national interest . It has also been driven by the need to promote national interest . Yet with Bill Clinton 's presidency there came an impasse : a dove on the Vietnam War who rejected Reagan 's neoconservatism yet embraced his promise of free markets , how was he to reconcile his anti-conservatism with the imperative to exert US strength abroad ? The Clinton administration did this by looking at the world through a new lens : liberal interventionism . <p> On four occasions under Clinton , liberal interventionism resorted to military action : Somalia , Haiti , Bosnia , and Kosovo . How did Cold War doves turn into humanitarian hawks there ? Simple , Krauthammer argued : they saw in these countries a cause for intervention " devoid of raw national interest . " In other words these were propelled by a call to promote US interests , but those interests were n't national interests . They were more values than interests : they used the force of moral suasion , rather than the threat of war , to intervene . <p> The issue here was that while liberal interventionism operated on the premise of multilateral action , it did n't need multilateralism to act . The truth was that US administrations , regardless of whoever was in power , could have gone there and bombed the living daylights out of an entire civilisation without requiring a by-your-leave from the UN or the EU . Reagan did n't inform Margaret Thatcher of his intention to invade Grenada even at the tail-end of the Cold War , so why should Joe Biden defend the Chemical Weapons Convention on the grounds of the " moral suasion of the entire international community " ? <p> Liberal interventionism , then as now , works best when one superpower rules them all . It does not work when two or more rising powers challenge the hegemony of the one superpower . It does not work when multilateral institutions are used by these rising powers to pre-empt the choices that the superpower has to make to impose its will upon us all . Thus it was perfectly suited to 1990s , when Somalia , Bosnia , Haiti , and Kosovo could happen with consensus . It was ill-suited to the end of the 1990s and the 2000s , when tensions between civilisation-states no longer made " moral suasion " good enough grounds for US intervention . <p> What could a viable alternative be ? Certainly not Kissingerian realism . Even realists had long abandoned Kissinger 's axioms about the irrelevance of morality in relations between nations . The world was too dangerous a place to try that out : unlike earlier , when nuclear powers banded themselves into either of the two main camps ( Communist and capitalist , aligned and non-aligned ) , now they were left to their own devices . Indeed , the flip-side to US power over the world after the Cold War was the " nationalisation " of the nuclear programme : India and Pakistan now would use the bomb not in the backdrop of detente between the US and the USSR , but in the backdrop of clashes between Hindus and Muslims . Amorality was no longer a card on the table because no one dealt that card any more : while nation-states were guided by the force of authority , there was now a moral aspect to that authority . <p> Iraq would have wanted to bomb Israel to preserve its power , but it also would have wanted to do so because of Arab tensions with a Jewish settlement in their territory . <p> In other words , what worked for the world before 1939 -- Wilsonian idealism -- and the world before 1991 -- Kissingerian realism -- would not work for the world after 1991 . Underlying this disjuncture between idealism and realism was another crucial one : between neoliberalism and neoconservatism . The two would meet in the Reagan presidency . <p> Under Reagan neoconservatism reared its head ( mainly but not only ) on the foreign policy front , and neoliberalism reared its head ( mainly but not only ) on the domestic economic front , promoting counterinsurgency in Latin America while cutting down the welfare state and also empowering the Christian Right and ballooning defence spending . It was a potpourri , and its relevance to post-Cold War US foreign policy lies in the fact that despite differences between the two , both tended to justify action with ideal : neoliberalism with its belief in free markets against government intervention , and neoconservatism with its championing of a traditional American order against internal threats and external enemies . <p> The neoconservatives found their home in the Bush II presidency . For a while , they grappled with what doctrine they could invoke to justify action . Then 9/11 happened . To validate US interventions in West Asia , the Bush troupe -- Cheney , Rumsfeld , Wolfowitz , and Perle -- all resorted to what Charles Krauthammer called " democratic realism . " It strove to balance the concerns of liberal interventionism with the imperatives of realism ; in other words , " We will support democracy everywhere , but we will commit blood and treasure only in places where there is strategic necessity -- meaning , places central to the larger war against the existential enemy , the enemy that poses a global mortal threat to freedom . " <p> To say that democratic realism squared the circle would be putting it mildly : in one stroke it assuaged the concerns of liberal interventionists , who did n't want to impose order without a humanitarian rationale for it , while alienating the isolationists , who did n't want the US to get involved in any order imposing project , period . What it did was to substitute values for power as the overriding principle of national interest , thereby distancing itself from the **32;871;TOOLONG school of international relations thought . <p> Francis Fukuyama criticised this new realism on the basis that it was aimed at a threat far removed from Soviet Communism . <p> To that Krauthammer retorted : " So what ? " Islamists may not have had the means of " actualising their vision " , as Fukuyama claimed it did n't , yet as Krauthammer observed , borrowing an analogy from Nazi Germany , Hitler did not have the means of actualising his goal of overrunning Europe when he marched into the Rhineland either . The argument was convincing , and it won over mild neoconservatives in the Bush II presidency . You see it crop up in Condoleezza Rice 's article , quoted above : she envisions an " American realism for a new world " , a fusion of power and principle . Instead of imposing our will upon them , she contends , an international order " that reflects our values " would be " the best guarantee of our enduring national interest . " <p> How prophetic those words were -- not . 12 years later , we 're gorging on the leftovers of the Trump presidency , which in the popular consciousness of Republicans got the United States out of Iraq and Afghanistan , reduced its military obligations in Europe , steered the country from **27;905;TOOLONG and democratic realists to America First , and got the job done in the economy . Were it not for the " China virus " , his supporters declare , Trump would have easily won , a point confirmed in less than expected Democratic victories even in states where they were expected to lead by wide margins . <p> If , for a brief moment at least , the paleoconservatives had their day in the US , it was because democratic realism , which combined the humanitarian ideals of the Clinton presidency with the neoconservatism of the Bush presidency , ended up promoting a variant of interventionism which could not really go or think beyond recreating the world in America 's image . In that sense one can say it differed in degree and not in substance from the Wilsonian idealism and the Kissingerian realism which it eschewed . Coming in the wake of the " unipolar moment " in human history , it could not survive China 's rise and Russia 's shift to the East , or the coming up of regional powers , unless it evolved a strategy of engagement with them . <p> America 's belief in messianism must end , not because it is n't a superpower , but because it 's not the only major power . Therein lies the key difference between the bipolarity of the Cold War , the unipolarity of the 1990s , the nonpolarity of the early 2000s , and the multipolarity of now : this is a world which pits the US and China on a collision course with each other , with regional players siding with either side . Interventionism by the US , no matter how pure the intentions it exhibits to the world may be , will invariably end up as a failure because every country it intervenes in will oppose it . Thus the world , contrary to what President-elect Biden says , can and will organise itself , and it will do so to oppose any one power leading the race to sort everything out . Think of it as a more interlinked order in which Rome reigns in one corner and the Persians and Chinese reign in another . In that sense this is not a Cold War . It is hotter than any Cold War . And interventionism will only make it hotter . To prevent that from happening , the US needs a new doctrine . A new realism , for a new order .

The report referred to the gig economy and its workings , pointing to the difficulties in controlling these foreign companies , in the absence of local business registration .

In contrast , local platforms are under regulatory scrutiny and are liable for local taxes .

He referred to data as the oil in the new world order . What this means is that in today 's context , protecting one 's borders goes beyond physical factors , and proper data protection laws are necessary if we are to safeguard our wealth . <p> I agree that it is almost impossible for a small country like ours to live without interaction with foreign players , but what needs to be done is to give local companies in this sphere , a fighting chance .

These countries have recognised the necessity in regulating the playing field , taking measures to implement or propose the Digital Services Tax ( DST ) in order to ensure that large digital companies -- mostly ridesharing and peer-to-peer gig activities -- pay adequate corporate taxes to host countries , from where they receive major revenue shares . The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development , ( OECD ) is another establishment working to reform international tax laws targeted at taxing large-scale digital companies , but has not yet arrived at a suitable agreement .

That being the case , we need to look at ways to circulate these digital budgets within the country . It is not that we do n't need to advertise through foreign channels but we should take the UK example , and find ways to do it in a way so that the local industry can benefit from it . <p> Though all this may sound a little technical and a subject for those who understand technology , that 's not the case .

@@61627240 <p> Collective travel ban imposed on the Army Commander and his family by the USAPosted on February 19th , 2020 <h> MEDIA RELEASE by Mahinda Rajapaksa Prime Minister <p> The United States of America has prohibited the Commander of the Sri Lanka Army Lt. Gen. Shavendra Silva or members of his family from entering that country . Even though we are now in the 21st Century , even members of his family who have not been accused of any wrongdoing have been subjected to a collective punishment reminiscent of the practice in medieval Europe . The people should be the judge of how fair this is . Even though this collective punishment has been meted out on the grounds that the Army Commander had committed violations of human rights , no one knows what these allegations are . Even though the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights says that until a person accused of a crime is proved guilty according to law , he should be deemed innocent , this principle does not seem to apply to Sri Lanka 's Army Commander or even to members of his family . Our government has already conveyed our displeasure in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strongest possible terms . <p> It is because of the historic betrayal committed by the yahapalana government formed by the United National Party , the Tamil National Alliance and the JVP in co-sponsoring UN Human Rights Council Resolution 30/1 in 2015 that other countries are able to name members of our armed forces as violators of human rights . The first operative paragraph of that Resolution had taken note ' with appreciation ' the September 2015 Report of the Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights which accused the Sri Lankan armed forces of human rights violations . This report was based on the previous 2011 unofficial report prepared by a three member committee appointed by the then UN Secretary General outside the established procedure of that organisation . In this manner , the UNP-TNA-JVP combine ended up accepting all the unfounded allegations made against our armed forces by various interested parties . Our government has decided to withdraw from the process of co-sponsorship in relation to Resolution 30/1 . <p> Even though the Army Commander of our country and his family have been subjected to a collective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not condemned it .

The JVP says that the USA has imposed a travel ban on the Army Commander and his family at this particular moment due to a deal to ensure that the SLPP obtains a resounding victory at the forthcoming Parliamentary elections . For its part the Tamil National Alliance has welcomed the collective travel ban imposed on the Army Commander and his family . The people should take note of the fact that when the UNP government co-sponsored Resolution 30/1 in the UN Human Rights Council , the so called anti-imperialist JVP did not oppose it . <p> From the discussion that has taken place with regard to the collective punishment imposed on the Army Commander and his family , it becomes clear that the political divide in this country is between the patriotic camp which puts the country first , on the one hand , and born traitors who are waiting for the first opportunity to betray the country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minister <h> Leave a Reply <p> Disclaimer : The comments contained within this website are personal reflection only and do not necessarily reflect the views of the LankaWeb .

@@61701237 <h> Courtesy The Daily Mirror <p> The government should not act like Nero , who played the fiddle when Rome was burning or beat about the bush but should announce a complete lock-down to prevent the spread of COVID-19 , Samagi Jana Balawegaya ( SJB ) Leader Sajith Premadasa told a news conference today . <p> Many countries have cancelled all events and gone into nationwide lock-downs . France has cancelled the second round of its local elections , Britain has postponed its local elections while the US is currently carrying out discussions on postponing its presidential election even though it is only due in November . However , the Sri Lankan government is having election mania hell-bent on obtaining a two-thirds majority in Parliament , " he said . <p> Mr. Premadasa said the number one priority is to protect the people and prevent COVID-19 from spreading . " <p> He said his earlier requests to call for a national-level discussion and the postponement of the general election has been unfortunately turned down by the government . ( Yohan Perera ) <h> 3 Responses to " A complete lock-down essential : Sajith " <p> Sri Lanka was spared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainly because of the wisdom of the majority of the general populace and to boot it all up some timely divine intervention . <p> Now this political neophyte whose only reason for fame is his infamous father , wants to be the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka . Presently when the whole world is facing a health / medical disaster and closer to home our Mother Lanka , instead of cooperating with the government he is making professorial pronouncements on how to contain the Corvid-19 menace . He wants the whole of Sri Lanka to be in lock-down and quarantined . He has no idea of what he is suggesting involves nor the logistics necessary . Like Rip Van Winkle he has suddenly woken up from a deep slumber and suddenly found himself active in politics . <p> He has no idea where he was during the Bond Scams nor when the Easter Sunday attacks took place . He seems to suffer from selective amnesia and behaves like the former strongman of North Korea who could give on the spot instructions on anything under the sun . At least in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader who took the might of the American war machine headlong . <p> Sajith Premadasa is not fit to be the leader of the UNP nor anything to replace it . It is unfortunate that UNP supporters can not find a suitable , capable and a charismatic leader to lead them . What awaits them is political oblivion ! <p> So far it is heartening to see the way the Sri Lanka government is making arrangements to meet the virus threat according to latest practices proactively and with the interests of all concerned be they Sri Lankans or foreigners . <p> If the UNP and their associated political parties had the interests of Sri Lanka at heart , the best thing they should have done was to have allowed the dissolution of the parliament soon after them losing the Presidential Election in November 2019 . That would have been the most patriotic action to take knowing that the electorate have rejected them not once -- at the local government elections in 2018 , not twice -- at the Bentara-Elpitiya by-electionin 2019 but thrice -- at the Presidential Election in November @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government and this made obvious when they refused to support a vote on a finance bill recently at the parliament . This was after telling the nation that the opposition would help the government on issues concerning the governance of the nation . <p> This did not leave any space for the President other than dissolving the parliament and go to elect a new government at the earliest . The shameful conduct of the opposition parties leaves no room to take on their word when they call to reconvene the parliament . <p> Moreover , they are now embroiled in internecine warfare -- the end result of which can only be the end of the UNP and all those past and present who have anything to do with their current brand of politics . Sajith Premadasa is only there to drive the final nails into the UNP coffin ! Hope he will have the physical courage to do it ! <p> If this Corona outbreak took place during their Yahapalana time , no doubt that we have to lockdown the whole country and the death toll may have been exceeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep sleep . <p> This fool does n't no what an idiot he is . Good for Mother Lanka because , Gota can develop the country while they are still finding a suitable replacement to lead the Unpatriotic UNP . <p> Pad sajith is barrel man hitler mala paharan 's double . This pea-brained idiot does n't know what he is talking about . Only a day or two ago , paada was saying Covid19 ca n't stop him meeting its supporters , and it had 3 meetings . with traitor foreigners tamils , mussies and some traitor Sinhalese dhrohiyas .

@@61701238 <p> Why we should give two-third majority to Podujana Peramuna and its Sandanaya and not vote for Sajith Premadasa led Samagi Peramuna , UNP. or JVPPosted on March 15th , 2020 <h> By Charles S.Perera <p> There may not be election meetings . There may not be house to house campaign by Candidates . But there may the possibility of voting for your preferred candidate from the political party you support . Therefore there are things that you have to think before you cast your vote . <p> We had been a country that was in the process of being divided and communally separated by a ruthless group of terrorists supported by the so-called Western Democracies . Yes , Western Democracies . We were saved from that eventuality thanks to the people who elected Mahinda Rajapaksa as the President of Sri Lanka in 2005 , amidst powerful forces against him within and without the country . President Mahinda Rajapakse faced that terrorist situation with Gotabhaya Rajapakse as his Defence Secretary . <p> Though many now try to take the credit for that great victory against terrorism , it was definitely the determination and the unwavering confidence Gotabaya Rajapaksa had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war " against terrorism . <p> Our Armed Forces were willing to take all risks , knowing that they were in the command of the reliable political leadership of President Mahinda Rajapaksa and the Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapakse , who himself had previously been in the war against terrorism . Therefore the Armed Forces stood firmly determined to defeat terrorism for good . <p> Despite that courageous decision taken and fulfilled , the people were ungrateful to Mahinda Rajapaksa who gave back to them the right to exist as a free people in a peaceful environment , yet defeated him at the Presidential election in January 2015 , to what they hoped was for a change for a better life , and we now know what cost that change of heart to bring to power the worlds worst government led by Maithreepala Sirisena and Ranil Wickramasinghe with the support of JVP which they called Yahapalanaya -- good governance . What a deception it was need not be reiterated . And the voting Gotabaya Rajapakse as the President in November 2019 with a 19 lack majority was a vindication of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gotabhaya Rajapaksa as the President of Sri Lanka in November 2019 . Sajith Premadasa did his best to balloon himself as the appropriate Candidate with working dynamos , fully charged batteries and above all with the genes of Ranasinghe Premadasa to lead Sri Lanka as its President . <p> But the people knew better , that neither Ranasinghe Premadasa , nor Ranil Wickramasinghe with whom Sajith associated was commendable men , and the son with such genes could not be any better than the father . <p> It was an error that the armed forces that wiped out the terrorists were considered to have violated human rights by the worlds most stupid Institution the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva when actual violators of human rights were Ranasinghe Premadasa and Ranil Wickramasinghe with a history of burning rebellious youth on pyres of rubber wheels and torturing others in Batalanda torture camp . <p> If the people were not wise enough not to have been swayed by Sajith Premadasa 's exaggerated trumpet blowing , we would have had the most disastrous President of all times in Sri Lanka . We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " talk of loud-mouthed Sajith Premadasa . <p> Fortunately for Sri Lanka , Gotabaya Rajapaksa a far more intelligent and visionary leader who could bring back Sri Lanka from the sad state it has been relegated to by the Yahapalanaya was elected as the President . But he has inherited an empty treasury and is compelled to govern under utterly modest financial conditions as a minority government in the Parliament . <p> The opposition led by the failed leader Sajith Premadasa who was finally elected in the Parliament as the leader of the opposition boasts that the opposition would vote with both hands " if the government were to present any bills in parliament . But that was a hoax to mislead the government . Their intention was to allow the government to present a Bill in Parliament and then vote against it , thus putting the government into greater difficulty by having to dissolve the government and reappoint a new government . <p> That became evident when the government presented a Vote on Account to parliament to pay the debts , incurred by the Yahapalanaya which remain unpaid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for farmers and medicine for hospitals , etc . <p> This move of the leader of the Opposition was a ploy to embarrass the government and antagonize the people against the government . But Sajith did not see that it was the country and the people who suffered as a result . This the people should take into account when they go to polls to cast their votes , and vote against the candidates put forward by the Samagi Peramuna of Sajith Premadasa , the UNP lead by Ranil Wickramasinghe , and Anura Dissanayake led JVP . <p> JVP leaders are clever to present to the people that both Samagi Peramuna of Sajith Peramuna and Podujana Peramuna will not be able to give the people the desired changes as it is they of the JVP , who has the key to provide the people with what they desire . <p> But these are mere words . Their true colours would be seen only if they ever come to power . They stand for a new Sri Lanka without its Buddhist cultural background , a country where there is no communal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they are politically sheltered by the UNP . <p> JVP can not understand the heartbeat of the people . Sri Lanka is unique because of its Buddhist Cultural background . The Sinhala people have no other country to claim to be theirs . Therefore Sri Lanka has to preserve its Buddhist Sinhala identity which JVP opposes on the ground of equality for all . <p> This is contrary to what the people desire and therefore the people should not vote for them as it would be a wasted vote . <p> Today the Government of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa is facing great difficulty in the administration of the country due to the financial mismanagement of Yahapalanaya . Perhaps the sudden fall of the price of fuel could be utilized by the government holding back the immediate benefits going to the people and use the fall off to bring substantial changes delayed due to the present financial difficulties , enhanced by the Coronavirus and the government 's great effort to save the country from making it goes to a pandemic level , and until a new Budget is passed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led by Sajith Premadasa and the JVP are trying to stop this possibility to allow the government to give the people the desired financial relief and find a way out of the present financial difficulties by insisting at their political platforms that the Government should give the people the benefit from the falling down of the fuel prices . <p> The Opposition Leader and the JVP are not clamoring for these demands for any love they have for the people and the country but merely to put the people against the government ad stop it from getting a two-third majority . <p> The financial crisis that the Government is facing is not it 's making but that of the Yahapalanaya Government which had failed to pay the bills for construction work , pay for the purchase of manure during their period of government and pay the unpaid bills for the purchase of medicine . <p> The financial difficulties the government is facing is a national issue where a reasonable , concerned Opposition should cooperate with the government by voting in the parliament for the Vote on Account if they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sajith Premadasa is a political leader without political maturity , working for his own personal aggrandizement . Therefore the well being of the country and its people are far from his thoughts . <p> Sajith Premadasa is campaigning with the intention of becoming the Prime Minister . But as the Minister of Housing in Yahapalanaya Government he was a failure . Furthermore , he had not even participated in any important debates in parliament , and above all , he does not show the qualities of a Prime Minister . That may be the reason why apparently Ranil Wickramasinghe seems to want his defeat . Ranil Wickramasinghe is also refusing to give him the leadership of the UNP . <p> These are the matters the people should think of and take into consideration at the polls and vote to give Mahinda Rajapaksa led Podujana Peramuna a resounding victory . That would be a vote to bring Sri Lanka to what it had been before the 8th January 2015 and for its development into a modern Sovereign National State with different communities living in harmony as Sri Lankans . <p> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tyranee " of the absolute majority should be avoided . That comes from the believers in an exaggerated democracy identified as British . <p> The democracy we have seen from our own experience and that of many other countries is being dictated to us by the so-called developed democracies insisting that the developing countries should adhere to a strict democratic norm as defined by them . But this norm is apparently different from their democracy . <p> These pontificators contrary to their strictures have adopted democracy to fit into their own purposes . We see the functionality of the UNHRC in Geneva to have got into a habit of looking at democracy differently according to the countries they deal with . <p> But developing countries should not adopt the western interpretation of democracy as such a system will not allow the developing countries to rise above their developing " status . In 2015 Mahinda Rajapaksa lost at the Presidential election because his opponents carried a campaign against him that the 18th Amendment to the Constitution was for him to continue to be a life-long President . <p> Which was wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and after a planned economic development program successfully brought The Sri Lankan economy to robust annual growth at 6.4 percent over the course of 2010 to 2015 . Sri Lanka is now focusing on long-term strategic and structural development challenges as it strives to transition to an upper-middle-income country . " Sri Lanka increased from below 15% of GDP in the mid-1970 to about 25% of GDP in 2010/ This is a remarkable trend . " ( World Bank ) . <p> President Mahinda Rajapaksa 's intention was to keep the pace of development by continuing to lead a government for a further period of five years to strive to transition to an upper-middle-income country , which he would have been able to accomplish if he was elected President at the 2015 Presidential election . <p> That was what Sri Lanka missed in January 2015 , and the result is that the Yahaplanaya reversed the development process to an economic growth below that of Afghanistan . <p> Today we have President Gotabaya Rajapakse who with keen intelligence and determination will follow the steps of his elder brother now his Prime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for its development and bring back the pace of development set by President Mahinda Rajapakse to take Sri Lanka to the next level of an upper-middle-income country and more . <p> To accomplish that for the people of Sri Lanka he needs a two-thirds majority so that he will not have to depend on any other political party , or allow other political parties to become a deterrent to reach reach the target he has set . <p> Therefore the people of this country should not hesitate to give their fullest support to President Gotabaya Rajapakse by giving a landslide victory to the candidates put forward by Podujana Peramuna and its allied Parties led by Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapakse . <h> One Response to " Why we should give two-third majority to Podujana Peramuna and its Sandanaya and not vote for Sajith Premadasa led Samagi Peramuna , UNP. or JVP " <p> Sinhalese should unite and wipe out anti Buddhist , anti Sri Lanka , anti Sinhalese , murderous ( Sinhalese Buddhists only ) , lying , thieves of the UNPatrioticrats party along with its sidekick jaathidhrohee vermins ' party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . <p> Traitor foreigners tamils , mussies are waiting in the wings like vultures to dismember Mother Lanka with the help of GooandPee and UNPatrioticrats .

@@61702230 <h> ALI SUKHANVER <p> For the last many years US has been providing immeasurable financial assistance and support to Afghanistan ; it is a day-light fact . Under the banner of USAID program trillions of dollars have yet been spent in the fields of health and education there . According to a report published by the USAID , ' the basic purpose of all this support is to help Afghanistan become a more responsible and integrated member of the region and the world . Apparently the USAID program 's only purpose is to bring more Afghans back into economic and civic life . US ' huge investments in infrastructure and human capital are making the country less vulnerable to insurgents and illicit business and more attractive for private-sector enterprise . ' But in spite of all these services provided to the people of Afghanistan , no one could say that the people of Afghanistan love and like the Americans because they have been serving them for so many years . <p> The reason behind this disliking for US in Afghanistan is that the Afghans hold the US authorities responsible for all the trials and tribulations they have been passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never forget thousands of their children who were burnt to ashes just because of the merciless bombings of the NATO forces under the command of US .

It is their harsh reaction which has compelled the US authorities on searching for retreating strategies . The Afghan people are so spiteful regarding the US troops that neither they let them go back nor let them stay in Afghanistan . <p> The same vindictive behaviour could be noticed in Palestine against the Israeli forces and in the Indian Occupied Kashmir against the Indian troops . Mr. Modi claims that he has tried to bring a new era of peace and prosperity by withdrawing the special status of Jammu &amp; Kashmir but a recent report of the Reuters points out a situation altogether different .

' <p> In short the ' marvelously gracious ' favours of Mr. Modi would simply add agony to the sufferings of the helpless Kashmiris . Mr. Modi claims that his actions like CAA and NRC are a favour and a blessing for the people of Kashmir , Assam and for Dalits , Adivasis , Vanvasis , Tamils , Gorkhas and so many others belonging to different tribes . Unfortunately the realities on ground are contrary to the claim of Mr. Modi .

Everyone got into the beds to hide but the men covered everything with kerosene and shouted : Will you come out or do you want us to burn you alive ? They smashed the bed where Musharaf was hiding underneath and dragged him out into the street . The children ran out , too , and were screaming . His daughter , Kushi -- she is just 11 -- fell on the feet of those men , pleading ' Do n't kill my father ' .

Certainly the reason behind this ' universal ' pathetic condition of Muslims is that they lack unity .

So what happens if the MPs who were on the CC are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 41E(7) of the Constitution , the only way that a Constitutional Council member with a fixed three year term can be removed is as follows : a ) if he resigns from his office b ) is removed from office by both the Prime Minister and Leader of the Opposition forming an opinion that such member is physically or mentally incapacitated and is unable to function further in office c ) is convicted by a court of law for any offense involving moral turpitude d ) if a resolution for the imposition of civic disability upon him has been passed by Parliament and e ) if he without obtaining prior leave absents himself from three consecutive meetings of the Constitutional Council . <p> As of now , the Constitutional Council is made up of the following members : Speaker Karu Jayasuriya , Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa , Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa , the President 's nominee Mahinda Samarasinghe , Bimal Ratnayake representing the smaller political parties , Talatha Athukorale and R.Sampanthan as the joint nominees of the PM and Opposition Leader and the three non parliamentarians , Jayantha Dhanapala @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , Naganathan Selvakumaran and Javed Yusuf . <p> Of these individuals , Mahinda Samarasinghe has joined the SLPP so if he gets re-elected to Parliament , there will be no issue with him continuing to represent the President till the end of his three year term . If he does not get re-elected the President can nominate another MP to represent him in the CC . Of the two MPs that the PM and Opposition leader are supposed to appoint jointly , Mr Sampanthan had been nominated to that position after he lost the position of Leader of the Opposition to Sajith Premadasa . It follows that if he is re-elected to Parliament as he certainly will , he will continue to be on the CC . The MP representing the Prime Minister is UNP/SJB Parliamentarian Talatha Atukorale who will continue on the CC if she is re-elected to Parliament . Then there will be the two outsiders Javed Yusuf and Naganathan Selvakumaran who were both appointed in October 2018 by the yahapalana Prime Minister and the yahapalana Opposition Leader . <h> The next Speaker 's burden <p> So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general election , the country would still not be rid of the yahapalana Constitutional Council . Of the existing ten members of the CC , there is the possibility that apart from Javed Yusuf and Naganathan Selvakumaran , Bimal Ratnayake , Talatha Atukorale and R.Sampanthan could still be sitting on the CC after the general election as well -- that 's five already . Then the opposition leader will be a yahapalanite which means that six of the ten members of the CC will be yahapalanites and this situation will continue till October 2021 . This has very serious implications . <p> The Constitutional Council is the body that decides who will sit on important commissions like the Election Commission , the Public Service Commission , the National Police Commission , the Audit Service Commission , the Human Rights Commission , the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption , the Finance Commission , the Delimitation Commission and the National Procurement Commission . <p> The Constitututional Council also has veto powers over the appointment of the Chief Justice and the Judges of the Supreme Court , the President and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Judicial Service Commission , other than the Chairman , the Attorney-General , the Auditor-General , the Inspector-General of Police , the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration ( Ombudsman ) , and the Secretary-General of Parliament . What we are now faced with is the possibility that till the last quarter of 2021 , we will be saddled with a Constitutional Council which does not represent the will of the people . The two thirds majority that the SLPP is asking for is not a luxury but a necessity . <p> Due to the possibility of the continuation of a yahapalana majority in the Constitutional Council , the defeated yahapalanites may be able to stuff the independent commissions full of yahapalanites just as they did earlier in 2015 . According to Article 41B , when the Constitutional Council recommends persons to be appointed to the independent commissions , the President has to make those appointments within 14 days of receiving the recommendations . If he fails to do so , the persons so recommended will be deemed to have been appointed as the members of the said Commission and the person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its chairman . <p> The Elections Commission appointed at the end of 2015 , will be completing its five year term at the end of this year . One can only imagine what could happen if the yahapalanites are able to continue to have a majority in the Constitutional Council . The Speaker of the next Parliament will have to be a very strong individual who will not take any nonsense from the Constitutional Council if the yahapalanites still have a majority in it after the election . According to Article 41E(1) the CC is required to meet at least twice every month . But such meetings have to be summoned by the Secretary- General to the Council only on the direction of the Speaker who will be its Chairman . If the worst case scenario materializes and the new SLPP government is saddled with a yahapalana majority Constitutional Council , the Speaker will have to keep it under control until October 2021 when a new CC can be appointed in the proper manner laid out in the 19th Amendment . <p> The very fact that a sitting member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an election shows the dire situation this country is in . Due to a providential piece of luck Javed Yusuf did not get to partner Ratnaveevan Hoole in the three member Elections Commission in 2015 . After winning the parliamentary election of August 2015 , the yahapalana camp divided up the positions in the government and the opposition among themselves with the TNA assuming the leadership of the opposition and the JVP taking over the position of chief opposition whip . The three non-parliamentarian members of the Constitutional Council were chosen by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe and Opposition Leader R.Sambandan which basically meant that all three were yahapalanaites . <p> A yahapalana Parliamentarian who may be sitting on the Constitutional Council has every right to join any political movement he likes because he is an elected representative of the people and he is sitting on the CC in his capacity as an MP . However it 's a very different matter when unelected members of the CC openly engage in politics . To be sure if the Constitutional Council had been constituted in the proper manner with Prime Minister Ranil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition group in the 2015 parliament ) deciding on the nominees , this situation would have been very different . Proponents of the 19th Amendment may argue that the Constitutional Councils appointed in 2015 and 2018 were aberrations and that the CC was never meant to be constituted in the way it was under yahapalana hegemony . <p> Indeed it was an aberration which places an added onus on the so called distinguished personalities appointed from outside Parliament to the Constitutional Council to make up for that by their exemplary conduct . But what we are seeing is the very opposite . <h> Lackluster election campaign <p> Victory for the SLPP at this election is a foregone conclusion and the holding of the general election may not be disrupted despite the discovery of an unexpectedly large Covid-19 cluster in a rehabilitation centre in Kandakadu . The discovery of this cluster was a reminder to everyone that we are not through the woods yet . However similarly large clusters were found among returnees from overseas but the spread of the disease has so far been successfully contained . By now the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lockdowns to contain outbreaks . The health guidelines issued for the election were based on the assumption that the Covid-19 threat was still ongoing , so the proper implementation of the same will enable the election campaign to go ahead without interruption . <p> With just over three weeks to go for polling day , the only visible signs of enthusiasm in this campaign are to be seen at meetings of the SLPP attended by the President and PM . The opposition parties appear to be struggling to maintain the momentum of their campaigns . Covid-19 , the split in the UNP and the certainty of defeat at this election have all taken their toll on the UNP 's breakaway group the SJB . However , there always is a greater level of activity in breakaway groups of political parties which appears to be missing in this case . There was even the report that the feverish attempts to get the Gazette notification dissolving Parliament cancelled was to allow the estanraged factions of the UNP to patch up and contest as one entity as the prospects of both factions would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact may be why the NGO community got together to oppose the government 's bid to obtain a two thirds majority as recounted earlier . Personalities not seen in public after 2015 have emerged out of the woodwork to salvage what they can out of the shambles of the yahapalana experiment . There is the possibility that the efforts of the NGO community may depress the opposition campaign even further . That would be the equivalent of the SLPP having figures of the past like Sajin Vaas and Mervyn Silva on their stages . Be that as it may , the election campaign overall is so devoid of dynamism and the adrenalin factor that though we are in the midst of an election , the evening news bulletins start not with politics but with the arrest of hitherto unkown underworld figures and the like -- a very unusual situation indeed . The situation is such that one fears for the voter turnout at this election . Something will have to be done in the remaining three weeks to get the adrenalin pumping in order to bolster voter turnout . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this website are personal reflection only and do not necessarily reflect the views of the LankaWeb .

After insulting and causing embarrassment , they are regretting and crying over spilled milk for sympathy from Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith . What a shame ? <p> Do these shameless politicians deserve the franchise votes of the Catholics , Christians and other respected religious dignitaries of this country in the forthcoming General Elections ? Surely not . And what is the assurance that these shameless politicians offer to convince the above mentioned religious dignitaries ? It is very clear that all peace-loving citizens of this country , immaterial of their religion or nationality , should reject these politicians and send them home honourably and teach them how to respect the religious leaders of this country . <p> All patriotic citizens of this country will remember and have not forgotten the 21 April 2019 Easter Sunday 8:45 a.m. massacre incident before casting their franchise votes .

@@62158231 <p> The College of Community Physicians of Sri Lanka media Release on Attempts to Legalise Cannabis in Sri LankaPosted on September 28th , 2020 <h> Dr. Nihal Abeysinghe College of Community Physicians of Sri Lanka <p> The College of Community Physicians of Sri Lanka ( CCPSL ) is the apex professional body for the practice of public health in Sri Lanka . The CCPSL is responsive to the current and emerging public health challenges and see it as our duty to advocate on issues with an impact on public health . <p> Cannabis or marijuana is an addictive substance that leads to many negative consequences to public health . Addictions reduce productivity and wellbeing of the individuals , reduce quality of inter-human relationships , incur costs on households and health care systems and burden communities and society with direct anti-social impacts such as thefts , violence and poverty . In the recent past , tobacco and pharmaceutical industries ' interests on cannabis had led to a well-funded global lobbying movement for its legalisation . As tobacco is going out of popularity , tobacco industry is searching for an alternative and many major tobacco companies have now invested on cannabis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaf by the other in their supply and manufacturing processes . <p> World Health Organization highlights cannabis ' potential to be a gateway drug , which may lead to tobacco , alcohol or other illicit drug addictions in youth . Studies show that the concentration of the addictive chemical ( Tetrahydrocannabinol -- THC ) in cannabis in the market today is as high as 30% , a drastic increase from what it used to be in the past ( around 3% ) . Thus , the current cannabis varieties in the market have a huge potential to be addictive and cause more harm if its availability and accessibility is improved by legalisation of the trade . Just because a drug is legalised , its illegal form will not disappear from the market as evident from tobacco and alcohol trades . There is plethora of evidence of harms of its use , including addiction , psychosis , memory disorders , permanent damage to developing brains of young users , respiratory diseases , subfertility and even acute cardiovascular effects causing sudden cardiac deaths . It has also led to increased road traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of America in which the drug is legalized for recreational use . <p> We acknowledge the use of cannabis in traditional medicine , and as currently it is legal and available for use for that purpose in Sri Lanka , we do n't see a justification to change the current status quo related to cannabis legalization status in our country . Recently we have noticed increased lobbying by different individuals and parties , who openly declare that they are cannabis users . We are surprised that the policymakers are publicly accepting the arguments of individuals addicted to an illicit drug and contributing to normalise its availability in the market . In addition , we observe that these lobbyists are publicly attacking the advocates of public health who raise their voices against this movement . We condemn such personal attacks on professionals and believe that these incidents indicate the negative impact on the society if this addictive substance become more available .

For selfish reasons , Trump neglected his main duty -- to protect the American people . <p> I ca n't support Trump because I ca n't back a candidate who has built his political career on racism and xenophobia . He started his 2016 campaign by falsely claiming that most Mexican undocumented immigrants are criminals and rapists ; he separated immigrant children from their parents ' and claimed that there are very fine people " on both sides when neo-Nazi thugs clashed with protesters in Charlottesville . <p> Emboldened by Trump 's racist rhetoric , neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups are flourishing . There is a huge rise in anti-Hispanic , anti-Black , anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim hate crimes in the United States , according to the FBI . Trump 's own former Defense Secretary ( R ) Gen. James Mattis said recently that his former boss is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people . " <p> I ca n't support Trump because his veiled threats not to recognize the results of the 2020 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America 's public servants and his daily claims that an independent press is the enemy of the people " undermine America 's democracy like nothing else we 've seen in our lifetimes . <p> I ca n't support Trump because his efforts to dismantle Obamacare without replacing it with any other plan threatens to leave millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions without health services . <p> I ca n't support Trump because he is on the wrong side of the struggle to stop global warming , protect women 's rights and pass gun-safety measures . <p> I ca n't support Trump because his claims to have created the greatest economy on Earth are ludicrous . Before the pandemic , he had largely benefited from , and continued , the Obama years ' recovery . <p> While former President Obama reduced unemployment from 10 percent in 2008 to 4.7 percent in 2016 , Trump only further reduced it to 3.7 percent in early 2020 . Since the start of the pandemic , it 's back to nearly 8 percent . <p> I ca n't support Trump because his foreign policy -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United Arab Emirates -- has been a string of failures . His Israeli-Palestinian peace plan never materialized , his love affair with North Korea resulted in nothing and his verbal attacks on European allies have left America more isolated than ever . <p> What 's worse , Trump 's embrace of the dictators of North Korea , Russia , China , and Turkey has left the United States with no moral authority to lead any international efforts to restore democracy and defend human rights anywhere , including in Venezuela and Cuba . <p> As Trump 's own former National Security Adviser John Bolton told me , Trump 's hard-line rhetoric against Cuba and Venezuela is political theater for domestic consumption . If Trump were serious about restoring democracy in Venezuela , he would have long put pressure on Russia -- Venezuela 's biggest backer -- to stop helping that country 's dictatorship . <p> I ca n't support Trump because hardly a day goes by without him insulting our intelligence , claiming that the COVID-19 pandemic is almost over when U.S. coronavirus cases are once again on the rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or re-tweeting crazy conspiracy theories such as the one alleging that Osama bin Laden 's death was an Obama hoax . <p> Trump is not just a horrible person , a danger to public health and a serial liar . He 's a threat to America 's democracy . Another four years of Trump would turn this country into a banana republic . America needs a return to normalcy . <h> Leave a Reply <p> Disclaimer : The comments contained within this website are personal reflection only and do not necessarily reflect the views of the LankaWeb .

@@62224233 <p> Mike Pompeo you are not welcome , if you come to tell us who we should have as friends.Posted on October 27th , 2020 <h> Charles S.Perera <p> Last time we had a US Secretary of State was John Kerry , who came to rejoice the change of regime in Sri Lanka to which the USA had generously distributed 485 million dollars among Sri Lanka , Burma and Nigeria to re establish democracy . <p> It is no secret that there was also a presence of Secret Service Personnel from the USA , UK and India during the 2015 Presidential election in Sri Lanka working behind the scenes to make a success of USA efforts of putting developing countries into political peril by its strategic regime change policy . <p> Though USA rejoiced that change of regime for which it had contributed generously , the Sri Lankan people suffered the loss of a freedom and democracy which it had recovered in 2009 after defeating a ruthless terrorism that had lasted for 30 years . <p> USA in reality rejoiced in the change of regime in Sri Lanka which allowed them to have a foothold on the strategically precious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the South Asian region . That had not been possible throughout the period President Mahinda Rajapaksa was running the country . <p> The American re establishment of democracy as John Kerry announced made Sri Lanka poorer than it was before the Presidential election in 2015 . It took four and a half years for Sri Lanka to have fresh presidential elections to have hopes of rising above the situation the Yahapalanaya Government which John Kerry had established had dumped the country into an economic growth of 2.6 which is less than even that of Afghanistan . <p> Despite a pandemic that hit the country , the election of Gotabaya Rajapaksa as the President of Sri Lanka gave the people new hope for development which will bring the country back to what it had been before the American sponsered change of regime and re establishment of John Kerry 's democracy in 2015 . <p> President Gotabaya Rajapaksa with his wise political maneuvers and correct administrative and personnel management was able to keep the pandemic at bay with only 13 deaths , until recently after the mysterious Brandix Cluster . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pompeo the US Secretary of State almost coincides with the Brandix Cluster reaching dangerously causing concern of it stretching into a community spread . <p> The Brandix Cluster causes serious concern as how it began and where it began remains wrapped in mystery . Has it been introduced purposely by an unknown agent to bring disrepute to the Government , seeking to re establish John Kerry 's democracy that changed its form in 2016 ? <p> During the last 4 and half years Sri Lanka was fast losing its sovereignty , and only saw negative forces trying to make Sri Lanka a failed state . There were Singapore Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreements , SOFA , ACSA , etc. which were not in the interest of Sri Lanka . There is another Agreement the MCC which the people of Sri Lanka has said is not in the interest of Sri Lanka and the signing of which should be refused by the peoples ' government that came into effect in November 2019 or even by any government in future . <p> While the previous US Secretary of State John Kerry came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Yahapalanaya Government , the people refused to accept it , but they were trapped by the Amendment19 of the Constitution to suffer it , until the end of four and a half years . <p> The present US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has on the other hand come with a message that We urge Sri Lanka to make difficult but necessary decisions to secure its economic independence for long-term prosperity , and we stand ready to partner with Sri Lanka for its economic development and growth , .... " stated by Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary Dean Thompson replying to a question posed to him about Sri Lanka 's growing relationship with China . <p> Unfortunately Sri Lanka can not give up its old friend for new friends . As Sri Lanka is following a non aligned foreign policy it would accept any assistant from any country provided there are no conditions attached to such offers . If America stands ready to partner with Sri Lanka for its economic development and growth , Sri Lanka may consider such partnership and accept such offers only if it does not demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Sri Lanka had gone through a difficult period of thirty years when it was battered by a ruthless terrorism . Early during the terrorism the President J.R.Jayawardhana who was well known as great friend of America and for that very same reason called Yanky Dickey " , believed his friendship with America will stand as a safety net in case of any serious prolitical problems . But the necessity of the safety net he believed in arose when the terrorists were besieged by the government forces , and India forced Sri Lanka 's airspace to drop dry ration to the besieged terrorists . <p> India did not stop at that but promised to disarm the terrorists if Sri Lanka would Constitutionally guarantee establishing provincial Councils in all Provinces . Unfortunately President J.R.Jayawardhana 's American Friends- his expected safety net , turned their backs on him and the President had to give into the demands of India . <p> Thereafter , America did not come to the help of Sri Lanka in its military operations against the terrorists . But America was more helpful to the terrorists . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrorists said that all terrorists can not be lumped together " . She also accused the Sri Lanka army for using rape as an arm against terrrorism , without any evidence to support her statement . <p> There was also the American Ambassador in Sri Lanka who was later the Assistant Secretary for Asian Affairs Robert O'Blake , who opposed military operations against Terrorists , and insisted on a political solution . During the height of military operations against terrorists Robert O ' Blake was doing a lecture tour in South India condemning the government of Sri Lanka for the choice of a military solution against terrorism . That helped the terrorists gaining stronger support from India and Sri Lanka had few friends to turn to during that time . Fortunately . China , and Pakistan was then always there to help Sri Lanka . <p> Again , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during those difficult period of terrorism never sympathised with the government of Sri Lanka , but was ready to help the terrorists who for her were freedom fighters . Hillary Clinton even paid a state visit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the terrorists in Sri Lanka . <p> America was even ready to send a warship to receive the terrorist leaders of Sri Lanka which did not materialise due to the great political leadership of President Mahinda Rajapaksa , and the support of his Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa who thwarted such efforts to rescue the terrorist leaders initiated by the foreign Secretaries of UK and France . <p> The USA was not a ready partner at those difficult times to help us either with our military operations against terrorists ( except providing vital military information ) , or offer did not come to help Sri Lanka at that time to partner with Sri Lanka for its economic development and growth " . <p> Well Secretary of State Mr. Mike Pompeop that 's how America had helped " Sri Lanka during those difficult times . But then we had friends to help us without conditions attached . <p> And those friends are friends of Sri Lanka who can not be dropped because someone comes around now to show sympathy to us . It is up to America to help us but without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our friends should not be . We also can not sign any agreements if such agreements will put in stake our sovereignty , to become a country obeying another State because it is rich and powerful . <h> 3 Responses to " Mike Pompeo you are not welcome , if you come to tell us who we should have as friends .

These are the very ideals of the Christian West that they themselves so unashmedly violate from Hiroshima , Nagasaki , Vietnam to Middle East and elsewhere too innumerable to site here , that they come to preach to us . These are the very notions on which they impose all too important sanctions on less powerful nations at their will and pleasure . <p> However to date these high fluenting ideals have not advanced one bit the status of the poor around the world other than making the rich richer and the poor poorer . These ideals have lead to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very ideals have failed to bring food or shelter to the poor .

There is wisdom in our DNA to stay independent . Let us steel ourselves to weather the storms ahead and let the President on whom the majority have laid their faith on , guide the Nation through these difficult times . May the President and his administration have the courage and determination to stay the course and not diminish our proud history as a Sovereign and Independent Nation . <p> All countries that include US are welcomed in the island as long as they do n't interfere with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up business to create jobs and exports but no schemes that bribes the politicians in power.Definitly no military bases in the island . <p> I think Bush administration did helped us to fight the terrorist war with intelligence and with some naval vessels .

@@62224234 <p> US Advice to Sri Lanka on Picking Sides in US-China Rivalry Kicks Up a Storm , Rebuked by Beijing.Posted on October 27th , 2020 <h> Courtesy Sputnik <p> US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will leave for Sri Lanka on a two-day visit starting Tuesday , after he concludes a 2+2 Dialogue with India . From Colombo , Pompeo will be travelling to the Maldives and Indonesia to further America 's Indo-Pacific strategy . <p> Sri Lankans have n't taken kindly to the Trump administration 's advice that Colombo must pick between the US and China , with many social media users rejecting any foreign interference in the nation 's domestic affairs . <p> ? Foreign policy observers have also reckoned that there is not a chance that Pompeo can make Sri Lanka change its mind about China . " <p> ? The strong reactions from Sri Lankan netizens come in the wake of last week 's remarks by US Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary Dean Thompson , in which he had called upon Colombo to make difficult but necessary decisions " . <p> The US Secretary of State is set to visit Colombo on a two-day visit starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open Indo-Pacific region , " a State Department release underlined last week . <p> Pompeo is scheduled to hold discussions with President Gotabaya Rajapaksa , Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and Foreign Minister Dinesh Gunawardena during his two-day visit . <p> According to Sri Lankan media reports , Pompeo is expected to press Sri Lanka to stop favouring China-funded infrastructure projects and opt for other international project partners instead . As of 2018 , China had invested nearly $8 billion in infrastructure projects in the South Asian island nation , with Colombo Port City and the Hambantota Port Projects being the two major ones . <p> A report in the Sri Lankan media , citing foreign policy officials , claimed that Pompeo 's advice would be politely rejected " by the Sri Lankan leadership . The Sri Lankan official cited in the report claimed that Colombo owed China only 10 percent of its $55 billion in overall foreign debt . <p> Pompeo is also expected to ask Sri Lanka to accept American funding to the tune of $480 million , part of the USAID-led Millennium Challenge Corporation Compact ( MCC ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reservations about the terms of the pact . <p> The ongoing reconciliation process between Sri Lankan Tamils and the majority Sinhala Buddhist community is another test issue set to come-up in discussions . <p> We expect Secretary Pompeo to call upon the Sri Lankan government to strictly follow the 13th Amendment provisions and forge ahead with the promised agenda of devolving power to local councils , " Maravanpulavu Sachchithananthan , the leader of Jaffna-based Tamil rights group Siva Senai , told Sputnik . <p> Significantly , the US State Department had in February of this year imposed a travel ban on Sri Lanka 's Commander of the Army and Chief of Defence Staff Shavendra Silva over his alleged involvement in war crimes " at the end of the Sri Lankan Civil War in 2009 . <p> Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna , a left-leaning party , has even asked the Sri Lankan leadership what it was hiding about Pompeo 's upcoming visit to the country . <p> China hits out at US <p> Meanwhile , a late night statement by the Chinese Embassy in Colombo took exception to US ' interference " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US official were filled with the Cold War mentality and hegemonistic mindset doomed to fail , which fully exposed the consistent US practice of arbitrarily interfering in other countries ' domestic and foreign policies and forcing small and medium-sized countries to choose sides , " said the Chinese Embassy statement . <p> The statement further accused the US of bullying " Sri Lanka into picking sides , as it urged Washington DC to face up to the popular base " of Sri Lanka-China relations . <p> The Chinese Embassy also castigated Pompeo for burdening Sri Lanka with an official visit at a time when the country was experiencing a surge in coronavirus cases . <p> Does this approach truly prove your respect to the host country ?

@@62349233 <p> Confronted with rising anger among workers , who forced the closure of an infected factory , Sri Lankan President Gotabhaya Rajapakse on Sunday announced an extension of a lockdown in selected areas and home quarantine " for suspected cases . At the same time , he tried to blame ordinary people for the resurging COVID-19 pandemic in the country . <p> Last week , the MAS Holdings-owned Bodyline garment factory , which employs about 6,000 workers , was compelled to close down . One member of a 200-strong team tested positive . When 145 team members were tested , another 34 were found to be infected . Workers ' opposition forced the factory to shut . <p> MAS is a giant company , with factories in 15 countries employing around 99,000 workers , producing apparel for international brands such as Victoria 's Secret , Marks &amp; Spencer and Calvin Klein . <p> Nurses protesting in Kandy last July <p> Rajapakse made his announcement in a discussion with the Presidential Task Force ( PTF ) on COVID-19 at his office . The media ran reports painting those measures as the government intensifying the battle against rapid spread of COVID-19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuing corporate operations , particularly factory production for exports , forcing workers to stay on the job . <p> Basil Rajapakse , the president 's younger brother , who heads the PTF , said on Monday : The majority opinion was to impose a nationwide curfew . " He added that health authorities wanted to stop everything at least for 10 days . " However , the lockdown was limited to the Western Province . " <p> Since one coronavirus infected worker was found accidentally on October 4 at a Brandix Fashion Wear factory at Minuwangoda , the number of cases nationally has rapidly increased , to over 12,000 with 24 deaths , as of Wednesday . These numbers understate the toll because the government is not conducting systematic testing . <p> The president extended a lockdown of the Western Province until November 9 . Major commercial , industrial and administrative institutions are located in this province . In the North-Western Province some areas in the Kurunegala district have been isolated also . <p> However , these restrictions do not affect big business or state institutions . Last week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without hindrance , despite the pandemic . The Colombo government and the ruling class are following similar , criminal pro-business policies as their counterparts in other countries . <p> After the country felt the impact of the global coronavirus earlier this year , Rajapakse declared that the government had uniquely handled the pandemic and was able to control it , unlike other countries . Over recent weeks this lie has been exposed as the pandemic began to spread . <p> During the last nine months the government has taken no measures to overhaul the health system , which has been increasingly run down during the past four decades under successive governments . <p> Last week , the head of the National Operation Centre for Prevention of COVID-19 Outbreak , Army Commander Shavendra Silva , said the first contacts of infected patients would undergo home quarantine but would not be sent to designated quarantine centres . That is because there is inadequate space and funds . Yesterday , it was reported that nearly 64,000 persons are already in home quarantine . " <p> The government is not recommending systematic polymerase chain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tests should only be conducted on the 10th day of quarantine , the president has ordered . <p> Rajapakse cynically emphasised the importance of conducting continuous and regular random tests . " Yet the government has just 25 PCR test machines , which can process about 8,000 samples daily , state health spokesman doctor Jayaruwan Bandara said . One machine was broken for days and only repaired this week . <p> An editorial in the pro-government Island newspaper indicated the run-down condition of the public health sector . It warned that limited intensive care units could be overwhelmed soon . The country has only 641 hospitals with 84,728 beds ( 3.9 beds per 1,000 persons ) , " it stated , and most of them were overflowing with patients even before the COVID-19 outbreak . They usually have patients lying under beds and in corridors . " <p> There are only 91 medical officers and 212 nurses per 100,000 persons . The editorial added : These numbers are not sufficient . Frontline health workers are burnt out , and some of them have even contracted COVID-19 . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nurses and other hospital employees , have been infected . <p> An incident recently reported in the Kaduwela area , near Colombo , demonstrated the impact of the government 's policies on the lives of the affected people . A man who tested positive for the virus had to stay at home for four days . When he called the relevant authorities , he was told there was no room in hospitals . " He spent all four days outside his house , fearing that his wife and children would become infected . <p> The government last week decided to use a low-cost Rapid Antibody Test ( RAT ) , which is not widely endorsed by epidemiologists . Sri Lankan medical expert Ravi Rannan Eliya told the Daily Mirror : RAT tests are not as accurate as PCR , since a majority of those who tested positive are asymptomatic in Sri Lanka . " <p> Rajapakse is blaming ordinary people in order to cover up the responsibility of the government and the ruling class . At the meeting last Sunday he said : This is not a virus dropped by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People have a great responsibility . Obviously this situation has arisen because the people have given up that responsibility . " <p> Rajapakse 's priority is propping up the corporate elite , not funding the health sector . The government has released to big business , via the Central Bank , funds totalling 178 billion rupees , but for 2021 the government has allocated only 159 billion rupees ( $US873 million ) for health expenditure . <p> At the same time , the government has set aside 500 billion rupees for the military and internal security agencies . The Rajapakse regime is preparing to suppress working class unrest . <p> The government is keeping the economy open for the benefit of the business elite , particularly for export production . Export Development Board chairman Prabhash Subasinghe last week said exporters should capitalise on the European Union 's recently extended Generalised Scheme of Preferences Plus ( GSP ) tax concessions . <p> Sri Lankan exporters have a natural hedge because of the GSP , " while creating a cost advantage to the European importers , " Subasinghe said . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the US is the largest importer of Sri Lankan textiles . Giant supply chains are reaping huge profits from apparel and other imports from sweatshops in Sri Lanka , as well as those in Bangladesh , Vietnam and other impoverished countries . <p> Foreign investors , some in partnership with local big business , are running factories in Board of Investment ( BOI ) approved operations , including in free trade zones ( FTZ ) , amid the deadly pandemic , with the Rajapakse regime 's blessing . <p> Some 1,615 factories outside the FTZs employ 580,000 workers , while 133,000 workers are employed inside FTZs . According to the BOI figures , however , only 28,670 PCR tests have been conducted among these more than 700,000 workers . Even with such low numbers of tests , more than 1,500 workers have tested COVID-19 positive . <p> According to BOI director general Sanjaya Mohottala : All the factories in general are strictly adhering to health and safety guidelines . The BOI is strongly upholding the relevant regulations . " <p> The reality is the opposite . When the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April , the employers adopted minimum safety measures , only to abandon them within a few weeks . <p> It is on record that the Brandix Fashion Ware management did not allow workers at its Minuwangoda plant to seek medical treatment , even when hundreds of them showed symptoms of infection during September . When the company was compelled to carry out the testing of all workers in early October , more than 1,000 employees were found to be infected . <p> The only concern of the Rajapakse government and big business is the extraction of profit from workers ' labour power , not human lives . <h> Leave a Reply <p> Disclaimer : The comments contained within this website are personal reflection only and do not necessarily reflect the views of the LankaWeb .
