Because a breach of trust can be established without any evidence of negligence or unreasonableness on the part of a trustee , it is important that trustees be protected from liability for certain acts . <p> There are four main ways to achieve this : <p> Exemption clauses : Trust deeds may contain exemption or exclusion clauses protecting trustees . These clauses vary widely , but are all aimed at excluding the personal responsibility of the trustees for breaches of trust . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trustee shall not incur any personal liability in the execution of any duties , rights or powers under this trust deed and rules , except in cases of fraud . If a trustee protected by such wording committed a breach of trust through an honest mistake , the clause would give him or her a defence to any claim for breach of trust . <p> Any trustee who wishes to rely on an exclusion clause must carefully check to see whether he is protected under its exact terms . Exclusion clauses are strictly construed by the courts , so if there is any ambiguity , the trustee is unlikely to be protected . <p> Indemnity from the employer : Pension trustees may seek an indemnity from the sponsoring employer before taking a particular course of action . For example , trustees may request an indemnity if the employer asks them to merge the plan with another or undertake some other activity that causes a material change in the plan 's operation . <p> It is common for trust deeds to contain a general provision that indemnify trustees by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in good faith . One limitation of an indemnity from an employer is that it is only reliable if the employer has the resources to indemnify the trustees when the need arises . <p> Indemnity from the pension plan : It is also possible for trustees to seek indemnity from the pension fund in respect of breaches of duty . Any such indemnity would need to be expressly contained in the trust deed and rules and would be of no value if the plan were in deficit . <p> Insurance : Trustees may seek to protect themselves by obtaining insurance against their liability for breach of trust . This is a helpful tool , but usually will not cover all breaches and can be expensive . If trustees decide to obtain insurance they will obviously want the cost to be covered by the pension fund . Insurance premiums can only be paid out of the fund , however , if there is a specific power in the trust deed allowing for this . <p> The Trustee Act : Section 24 provides for a limited implied indemnity for trustees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only for his own acts and not for those of any other trustee and may reimburse himself or pay out of the trust all expenses incurred in the execution of his powers . <p> Section 44 goes further to state that if it appears to the court that a trustee is or may be personally liable for breaches of trust but has acted honestly and reasonable and ought fairly to be excused for breach of trust and for omitting to obtain the direction of the court in the matter in which he committed such a breach , then the court may relieve the trustee either wholly or partly from personal liability . Whether a trustee has acted reasonably or honestly is a question of fact and the test applied by the courts is an objective one ; the question of whether the trustee ought to be reasonably excused is a question for the court to determine in light of all the circumstances of the case . A trustee relying on this provision will have to satisfy the court that they had good reason for not applying to the court for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trustees over recent years has developed considerably . <p> Trustees can not escape with a vague and superficial interest in the pension plan . They have to understand how it works , take complicated decisions regarding investment which will have a long-term effect on members , and generally take responsibility for the plan . <p> This , as well as members ' growing awareness of their responsibilities and greater willingness to claim rights or challenge decisions , results in a greater need for trustees to take measures to protect themselves to cover their personal liability . 
@@4524231 <h> PMS alert ! - The link between hormones and how we behave <p> OUR hormones -- namely oestrogen , progesterone and androgen -- are increasingly becoming the scapegoats for a number of reactions common to us . From low sex drive to an over zealous appetite for sex , from weight gain to mood swings , it seems these chemical messengers that regulate the human body have been credited for basically everything that brings us pleasure or pain . <p> But has the blame for some of our less desirous behaviours been fairly placed ? Can our hormones really take credit for the negative reactions we exhibit on a daily basis and how does a lack of it affect our lives ? <p> These were the questions we posed to consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist Dr Lloyd Goldson who was willing to clarify some of the issues surrounding these sex-related hormones . <p> " I am sure the hormones can influence behaviour , but then we need to know when something is not always an appropriate thing to do , " explained the gynaecologist . <p> " If your testosterone is low , then you might have a low sex drive and if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , but it does n't mean that one has to be promiscuous , " he said . <p> For a long time , men have blamed cheating on their high testosterone levels and women have equally attributed their mood swings to a decrease in oestrogen , especially during their menstrual cycle -- the dreaded PMS . Both hormones are usually referred to as the sex hormones because they help to control sexual maturity and reproduction . Both are produced at varying degrees by the ovaries in women and the testes in men , although females mostly produce oestrogen and progesterone while men usually produce androgens such as testosterone . <p> In men , the secretion of testosterone is responsible for the deep voice , the broad shoulders and the increased body hair while in women , the oestrogen is responsible for the development of breasts and the pelvic region . <p> Progesterone is the primary hormone for pregnancy and fertility as it prevents the shedding of the uterine lining . <p> " Excess progesterone can let you gain weight , if you have hypothyroidism , " explained Dr Goldson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while taking this hormone to regulate pregnancy . <p> But even though the sex hormones are to be blamed for some things such as an increase in sex drive , erectile difficulties , weight gain , and aggression , the gynaecologist was quick to point out , " We ca n't blame everything on the hormones " . <p> He drew on a recent incident to demonstrate the absurdity of claims made by a man that an increase in his hormone levels had caused him to do something against his will . <p> " Recently you had this man who got his stepdaughter pregnant and he told his wife that it is the devil . People just bring in something to blame because of their behaviour , " the doctor said . " But it has to do with a lack of control . " <p> While an excess of hormones seem to have the potential to wreak havoc on people 's lives , too little of it is equally detrimental . Women who produce too little progesterone usually experience miscarriages and a decrease in the production of oestrogen is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Due to a decrease of testosterone in men as they age , some also experience sexual dysfunctions which are usually corrected by the prescription of hormonal treatment . <p> Given the importance of hormones in regulating reproduction , there has been an increase in hormone treatments over the past few years . The most popular is birth control , which is utilised by women to prevent fertilisation . With certain birth control methods such as the pill , patch , the vaginal ring and the hormone shots or implant , oestrogen and progestin are released into the body to prevent pregnancy . But even these can lead to not so pleasant symptoms such as a low sex drive , mood swings and weight gain . <p> " I know that on the injection the complaint is that the libido goes down and you have to give them ( women ) something to increase the libido , " said Dr Goldson . <p> So while our hormones are truly the reason for some of our actions , they should not be blamed for everything , since we are still capable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COMMENT <p> HOUSE RULES <p> 1 .

I had undertaken a mission which was supported by my editors at The Gleaner Company to write features on prominent Jamaicans , and Jamaicans with emerging talent and voices , in a newly independent nation . Along with Dr Street , I wrote about Shirley Maynair Burke , St William Grant , Clement ' Coxsone ' Dodd , Bob Marley and the Wailers , Mallica ' Kapo ' Reynolds , Kenneth Mattis , Neville Willoughby and Judy Mowatt , to name a few . <p> My relationship with Dr Street brought to my attention the research being carried out then at the University of the West Indies into the ' anti-growth properties ' and medicinal values of the cerassee , periwinkle and marijuana herbal plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recalled were Drs Manley West and Alfred Lockhart . Patience , prudence and efficacy were some of the highly valued principles that instructed these researches and my involvement .

This I followed with several other articles in The Gleaner and Star , one of which was another significant development of the use of properties from the periwinkle ( also known as ram goat dash-along and ram goat roses ) plant in the treatment of leukaemia . My lead article on the anti-growth properties of Jamaican herbs led to quotes from my article appearing in The New York Times and other leading newspapers and wire services around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Gleaner , and having my work quoted in the editorial section of The Gleaner .

Because of my awareness of how Canasol had evolved as a drug for the treatment of glaucoma , from those earlier researches into the medicinal properties contained in Jamaican herbs , my NMBC partners used our relationship with Pfizer , the giant American pharmaceutical company , to have Pfizer send one of its managers to the mission in Jamaica . <p> Did n't happen <p> The intention was to have Pfizer invest in the manufacturing of Canasol for worldwide distribution through their global marketing chain .

Pfizer was at the time one of the primary corporate sponsors of the NMBC and played a major role in the programme that connected small , minority-owned businesses to Fortune 500 companies . <p> In the United States , one of the small companies of which I was a part owner was active in the health-food industry , and we supplied dried herbs imported from Jamaica to other small and medium-size companies in the herbal and nutraceutical business .

As I have articulated for so many years , a whole new mindset to finance capital being made available for entrepreneurial projects must be prioritised by the Jamaican government and implemented by the financial sector . <p> I will not here reiterate my proposed ' Develop Jamaica Initiative ' , but , suffice it to say , to move Jamaica away from its people sinking deeper into poverty and exposing more of the gross inequities in the society , a development czar must be introduced to the economic landscape to marshal the mobilisation of the Jamaican workforce and take charge of making the number-one priority for the country ; increased production and productivity ; someone with the zeal , the commitment , the passion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Robert Lightbourne brought to industrial development , Carlton Alexander and Mable Tenn brought to GraceKennedy , Gloria Knight brought to the Urban Development Corporation , Ray Hadeed brought to manufacturing , Tony Hylton to the shipping industry , Herbert McDonald and Herb McKenley to athletics , Theodore Sealy to journalism , Mike Fennell to sports , and Danny Williams to the insurance industry and philanthropy . <p> There is absolutely no other way out for Jamaica . And if this is not done , the political and financial leadership will have convinced many of us that its objective is to maintain the status quo , and lead the country into social upheaval and decay , rivalling countries like Haiti and too many African countries . Could this be the design for Jamaica ? <p> The nutraceutical market in the US alone exceeds US$26 billion per annum , and with the proven medicinal values of so many Jamaican herbs long established , it should have long been a strategy of the Jamaican leadership to position itself to take even one per cent of that market over a five-year period , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per annum , not to mention Europe 's market estimated to be larger than the US . It 's doable but it takes vision and proactiveness to inspire the Jamaican workforce to pursue this objective . And it must be a national thrust . <p> As I have stated unabashedly , I am a statist , especially as it relates to the governance and development of small nation states . Not for the government having total control of the economic life of the state as it was in Cuba and the Soviet Union , but that it plays a central role in setting parameters , policy , making finance capital available for an equitable and sustainable development , and bringing order and much-needed economies of scale for small nation-state industries to compete in global markets , oftentimes competing with nations multiple times larger in population . <p> A typical fundamental involvement of the government playing a participatory role in the economic life of a nation is to ensure that companies in an industry come together to impact global markets and not rely on so-called free market that provides mainly for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who may not be able to make a significant inroad into a huge market but rather just earn enough to satisfy its bottom line , excluding other smaller players from penetrating that market which would benefit a larger pool of the citizenry . <p> The Asian experience has done this effectively , looking to the pattern of growth and development of Japan , China , and Singapore . Jamaica 's leadership needs to emulate this and stop repeating the same mistakes and missteps .

Still , others crouched over their desks , faces down , alone with their pain . <p> Outside the classroom , one student unable to stand the heartbreak after being shown a photograph of the accident threw herself to the ground -- unconcerned with the soil to her tunic and losing her shoes and socks in the process . <p> " She know seh somebody did a go dead but she did n't know it was who , " a female student standing nearby interpreted for her peers who stood staring in commiseration .

@@4528230 <h> Daughter wants to force stepmom off dead dad 's property <p> I am writing on behalf of my aunt who is in her 70s . She was living with a man for over 20 years and bore him two sons . He died suddenly 11 years ago . He had two children outside of that union . After his death , his daughter moved into the house and since then my aunt ca n't live in peace . The daughter and her sons are trying to put my aunt out , saying she does not belong there . <p> He did not leave a will . Please tell me what she is entitled to . <p> Firstly , your aunt is the stepmother of this woman and the step-grandmother of her sons . She can therefore , if their conduct is such as to amount to abuse , apply for a protection order and an occupation order against them at the family court in your parish . If there is none , she can go to the Resident Magistrate 's Court . The protection order will order them to stop abusing , harassing and attacking , and from behaving in any way which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of house , so she will be left in peace . <p> I think that the application should be made ex parte , because from the sound of things , if they are served with the application while they are still in the house , they could do something to your aunt . So , help her make the application ex parte , get the orders which will be served on them by the police , with a summons for them to appear in court on another date when the judge will hear from both sides . <p> These are legal protective steps that your aunt can take and which will give her some peace , to enable her to sort out her late common-law partner 's estate . It is apparent that this has not been done even though he died 11 years ago . <p> The deceased did not leave a will , so he died intestate . This being so , his estate must be administered under the Intestates ' Estates and Property Charges Act . Your aunt should first apply for a declaration that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She must support the application with her affidavit of the facts of their status and that they were each single during the period they lived together as if they were man and wife . Her 20 years clearly is a multiple by four of the required period of five years ' cohabitation immediately preceding the date of death . So she will state from when they started cohabiting as if they were in law , man and wife , and that they lived that way up until the date of his death . She can also say that their neighbours and friends accepted and treated them as a couple . <p> She will then say that he died without leaving a will and say what property he had in his estate when he died , and that she continued to live in their home and still lives there and that his estate was never administered and that she wishes to do so now . She should also get about two other persons , say one neighbour and one of his friends , to also do affidavits in support attesting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wife for so and so years . <p> Once she gets the declaration , she can apply for Letters of Administration to administer his estate . It will cost money . How much will depend on the value of the property ( if this is all he left ) at the time of his death . The Stamp Commissioner 's office will fix the estate duty based on their assessed value of it at that date , or they can accept a credible valuation by a reputable valuator . Interest will be added to the duty fixed for the years between a year after the death and the date of the receipt for payment on a fixed date . Not to worry , all payments she makes must be pro-rated to be paid or deducted from other beneficiaries ' interests . <p> Now to the nitty gritty . The daughter is a beneficiary . So are her sons , but their interest in the estate property is not as great as hers . She has to share the issues ' share with your aunt 's sons and her other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to legally prove that the deceased was her father , before she can claim any interest . She may need to get a declaration of paternity , if he did not put his name and particulars in her birth certificate . The same applies with her sibling . I trust that as the deceased was cohabiting with your aunt all those years , that her sons ' birth entries were completed with his name and particulars as their father . If not , they will also have to apply for declarations of paternity . They can do this at the same time your aunt files her application for a declaration that she was his spouse and that she is therefore his widow . <p> Once she gets the Letters of Administration , she can ( if there is a registered title ) apply to and be registered on the title as the proprietor on transmission -- this means the she as administratrix of the estate is in charge to protect it for herself ( as she is also the largest beneficiary ) and the other beneficiaries -- this is all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She is responsible for distributing the estate . <p> As the spouse , she gets all the personal chattels , plus $10,000 or a sum equal to 10 per cent of the net value of the whole estate and she is not to contribute to the estate duty and costs . She is also entitled to 10 per cent interest per year on the $10,000 or the 10 per cent sum . This interest will run until the money which she is thus due is paid . <p> Then , assuming that the children prove paternity as the law requires , then as to the rest of the estate , after she has gotten the above , she would be entitled to half and then all the children would have the remaining half to be shared among them . <p> You see now why I said that she had more interest in the house than this grasping step-daughter . Only such a person would go into a person 's home and make that person 's life a misery by her abusive conduct , and an older person at that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of acceptable conduct . <p> Please help your aunt to protect herself from these interlopers , as they have no right to do what they are doing . Let her act quickly . They are clearly shortening your aunt 's life .

It also said that " the character of the offender and any other relevant circumstances are to be taken into account in so far as they may operate in his favour by way of mitigation and are not to weigh in the scales against him .

@@4528239 <h> Business <h> Owen James -- A grand career in journalism Part II <p> Owen James has been a journalist for some forty years . He is renown for his business programmes on TVJ but recently announced that he will be severing ties with the station to pursue new ventures In the first part of an interview with Caribbean Business Report , James discussed his early career which began at the Gleaner Company and the influence of Jack Anderson who he succeeded as Editor of The Star . He also told of how he moved on to the now defunct JBC further cementing his career . <p> JBC-building a team <p> In the early eighties Ulric Simmonds was General Manager of JBC and in him he found someone whom he could get along with and shared his vision to revamp the newsroom . They began to recruit professionals and develop a team that would put JBC on the map . At that time James had risen to Assistant Director of News , Sports and Current Affairs . With the help of the late Carl Stone he developed aptitude testing for recruits . <p> " We took on staff that became fine journalist , among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Corporate Affairs at Scotiabank Jamaica , Mark Thomas , Yvette Rowe and Anthony Miller who now produces and presents ER . They all did a fantastic job covering Hurricane Gilbert back in 1988 , which as you know caused major devastation to the country . <p> Anthony Miller is multi-dimensional . Today he is well known for his coverage of the entertainment industry but he is an excellent news journalist . That team definitely had ink in their blood . They were a fine generation of journalists who were intrepid and fearless , " said James tipping his hat to his former colleagues . <p> There was talk going around that JBC was to be divested and this created a frisson of uncertainty in the newsroom . James recalls that it was proving most difficult to motivate people at that time . It was during that period that JBC sought to recruit Gary Allen who is now the managing director of the RJR Group but they failed to land him . <p> With JBC being eventually divested in 1997 , all the managers were made redundant . James took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accumulated considerably over eight years and walk away with his pension payments . Together with his girlfriend he took an extended holiday and time out of the news business . <p> Turning to television <p> " By 1998 , life was becoming a bit boring . I became somewhat introspective and had to figure out what am I going to do now . One of the things I made up my mind not to do was to go and work in a newsroom . But what would I do with the skills I had acquired ? Eleven years at The Gleaner and fifteen years at JBC . I began to look at the electronic landscape and I noticed the absence of business news . In Jamaica there is a preponderance of political and crime news but very little emphasis is placed on business . <p> " In 1998 , I approached the then General Manager of Super Supreme Television ( SSTV ) Marcia Forbes and told her I wanted to do a business programme and I named it " The Business Day " . In those early days it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sports or entertainment . I therefore had to pitch it to corporate Jamaica . I remember speaking with the boss of Advertising &amp; Marketing , Arnold Foote who encouraged me to press ahead with the programme . He put Ralston Hyman who was working as an advertising executive for Foote 's company and who is now a business news broadcaster and Financial Editor of The Sunday Herald on it . Ralston to his credit saw merit in the programme and gave me my first ad which was Citizens ' Bank which became a victim of the financial meltdown of the nineties . " <p> With James unable to solicit more advertising , Marcia Forbes suggested that perhaps the programme should be pulled . James proposed doing the show free of cost on the days that there were no advertising sponsorship . Eventually was agreed that he would receive a paltry sum of J$500 on the days that were not sponsored . <p> A friend advised him to continue improving the programme and then get one of the blue chip companies to come on board . In 1998 Alison Binger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board . To this very day Jamaica National still sponsors the show . <p> " In Jamaica we have a herd mentality . Once Jamaica National came on board the flood gates opened and in those early days I got all the advertising I needed without the help of advertising agencies . I went to them and told them what the programme could do for them . I built relationships that have stood the test of time . <p> " I had an idea to showcase entrepreneurship in Jamaica and I called an ex-JBC colleague of mine called Monica Campbell . I told her that I would require financial backing because I work independently of the stations . That programme was " The Business Review " and the first sponsor was Doreen Frankson 's EdgeChem . With that programme we celebrated the successes of people with the entrepreneurial spirit not just the big companies . We featured people like Audrey Hinchcliffe who was so qualified , she could n't get a job in Jamaica . She started a cleaning business and the rest is history . I dubbed her " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Audrey Marks did with Paymaster which was revolutionary at the time and she has since gone on from strength to strength . When Unilever pulled the rug from under GraceKennedy , Douglas Orane remarkably was able to assemble a SWOT team that put together their own brands which proved more successful than Unilever 's and took the company to even greater profitability than during its Unilever days . <p> All Media Services <p> " Now if I 'm interviewing all these people with entrepreneurial fervour and flair , I must have learnt something from them and I did . In 2000 I started a company called All Media Services Limited and I set up office in a bedroom in a low income area . " <p> James surmises that the business community likes to see continuity and are risk averse . It likes to see something working . The programmes he created were successful and gained a following with a dedicated audience . He states that the programmes created good revenues for the RJR Group over the years . <p> How it worked was James would get a fee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenues . He believes those programmes played their part in enhancing shareholder value . <p> " I wish more persons at senior journalism levels would understand the importance of shareholder value because without it you do not have a job . <p> " My time with TVJ , a subsidiary of RJR lead me to believe that ownership was the way to go . In 2003 I conceptualised a programme called " On a Personal Note " which sought to highlight personal finance issues that impacted on Jamaicans . It focused on issues like young people remaining at home to save money , does one rent or buy a home ? How do I buy my first car ? The programme resonated with young people . I added a motivational piece in the show . Months after the advent of the show it won the top business award in Jamaica . I do n't like to blow my own trumpet but public opinion is my best reward . What the members of the public say about the value of my work is one of the things that have kept me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being a motivating factor in my career . I am also encouraged by entrepreneurialism . That is how I think we are going to pull this country out of the quagmire it has found itself in for over two decades . If we can harness the skills of our bright young people and change the bureaucracy that has enslaved our business sector and change the mindset of some of our business leaders , then I see a way out for Jamaica . " <p> Companies must keep profits in Jamaica <p> James went on to say that he would like to see more Jamaican companies spend more of their profits here or put another way , he wants to see them repatriate less of what they earn . The way he sees it , companies that make their profits here have a moral obligation to spend a substantial percentage of it in Jamaica . More than US$1 billion a year is repatriated out of Jamaica by companies operating here . <p> " I would like to see companies that are sold because others see value in them , that some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bolster and help Jamaica . It has to be reinvested here because if we do n't go that route , we will continue to go down hill . Bring that money back to Jamaica and influence government policy . We need to be more business pro-active and get behind the idea of seeing more Jamaican businesses flourishing . We have to put in place business-oriented policies that no idealistic political leader can ever again , put in place strategies to scare away capital from this country . I feel very passionate about this . It is a dream I want to implement through my body of work . I am an advocate and supporter of the free enterprise system which even former communist countries are now espousing , " declared the creator of ' The Business Day ' . <p> But all this can not come to fruition in a vacuum . James makes it clear that it is incumbent on inspirational private sector leadership to step up to the plate and accept some national responsibility . They have to head corporations that believe in Jamaica and have its best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media in Jamaica today ? <p> James with nearly forty years experience as a media practitioner would like to see greater mentorship and training in media houses . He sees talent in television , print and radio but says it needs to be harnessed . He added that he would not like to see many of his young colleagues go through what he had to . He would like to see the younger generation handle technical issues and complex controversial scenarios and come out unscathed . <p> " We are not the sole repository of knowledge and we have to recognise that . If you are weak in one area seek help from someone you trust and whose performance is tried and proven . The media landscape has been negatively impacted by the proliferation of media houses . <p> " When I entered journalism there were just two broadcast houses in Jamaica , RJR and JBC .

What has happened is that quality has been diluted because there is very little attention paid to training . Many of these media houses do not even have a meaningful training budget . For the profession to move forward this is necessary . You ca n't just rely on foreign entities giving you a grant to train your employees . Training has to be an integral part of any media business .

@@4530233 <h> News <h> Despair , hope follows Cross Keys High school killing <p> MANDEVILLE , Manchester -- Those in the know , tell of a supreme irony , as they reflect on the stabbing death of 16-year-old Haig Williams at the Cross Keys High School in south Manchester last Tuesday . <p> The extraordinary thing , they say , is that despite the persistent stigma of indiscipline and violence , the school has been recording significant improvement in academic and related performance in recent years . <p> Even young Williams ' grieving mother , Lucrecia Dean , made that exact point as she explained her reluctance to pull her son from the school following a violent attack on him three months ago . <p> " I was thinking of moving him to another school , but then again , he had improved so much , " said Dean . <p> " My son moved from 49th in his class to fifth on the last report , " she told the Sunday Observer . That spectacular movement , she said , had occurred between " second form and third form " . <p> Another parent , a father , also told of his own concerns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ High being diluted by indiscipline . <p> " My daughter is doing very , very well but now after this latest incident , we may have to move her , " he said . <p> Married and the mother of four , Dean says she is now sorry that she allowed herself to be swayed by her son 's academic growth . She insists that Cross Keys High is " out of control where discipline is concerned " and needs to be " taken over " by the Ministry of Education . <p> " The principal ( Ralph Nelson ) ca n't control it , the ministry must move in and do something about the school ... they need to come and weed out the bad weed and find a place for bad weed , " said Dean , who is herself a past student of Cross Keys High . She was " speaking out " in order to help other parents avoid her grief and pain , she said . <p> She took issue with news reports suggesting that her son had come from a " troubled community " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( just outside Mandeville ) in which she lives and her son had been growing up in a " peaceful , loving " home , she said . <p> The bottom line for her was that Cross Keys High " is not a safe place for kids " . <p> The Manchester police late Friday said they were yet to press charges against a teenager who had " confessed " to wielding the knife which took Haig Williams ' life . Investigations were continuing , the police said , in order to make their case as watertight as possible . <p> The tragedy at Cross Keys was the worst of several violent incidents over the last week on the grounds of so-called " upgraded " high schools . The following day , just over an hour 's drive away , at Balaclava High in North East St Elizabeth , another teenager was also stabbed , necessitating hospitalisation . <p> Her voice breaking at times , Dean told of how her son became enmeshed in a hostile relationship with other boys for reasons which remained unclear to her . <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Williams was taken off a bus in the " Rose Corner area " of south Manchester and beaten by a group of boys who accused him of " breaking " another boy 's arm . A report was made to the Cross Keys police , but as far as she was aware there had been no further developments . <p> " The police said they would get back to us , but nothing happened , " she said . <p> After that , said Dean , Haig confided to his older sister that he believed he was being followed by other boys . <p> Then , last Tuesday afternoon , while she was at work at a restaurant in Mandeville , the terrible news came that her son had been killed during the lunch break at school . <p> She ca n't say for sure that the same boys who had assaulted her son in March were involved in the fatal attack , but is angry because of what she describes as authoritative reports that members of that group who were banned from school at the time because of misconduct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Dean told the Sunday Observer that news reports suggesting her son had been involved in a fight were untrue . Word reaching her , was that Williams was " called over " by a girl , and when he responded , a group of boys rushed him -- one of whom stabbed him in the side and thigh . <p> Principal Nelson says Williams ' death came during a " melee " which was itself the result of an ongoing feud between groups of boys . His information , he told the Sunday Observer , was that two boys -- one of them a friend of Williams -- were " fighting and rolling " on the ground . Williams rushed to the scene and demanded , " Is wha a happen yah so ? " at which point , he was stabbed . <p> Nelson confirms the incident in March , but says two of those who attacked Williams at that time were actually taken into custody by the police . They had not returned to school , he said . <p> Arguing that Dean 's criticism of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haig Williams had been part of a group of boys who were also " aggressive " . <p> The principal spoke of a ' backs-to-the-wall ' effort by the school 's staff to transform the institution into one respected by the wider community for its academic and vocational achievements . <p> Schools such as Cross Keys High suffered , he said , because only the lowest achieving children from the Grade Six Achievement Test ( GSAT ) exam -- some of whom admittedly are " late bloomers " -- are assigned . He revealed that annually , " an average 60 per cent " of GSAT students arriving at Cross Keys High are functionally illiterate . <p> It 's a statistic that is expected to change substantially starting with the new school year in September , because of rules implemented this year barring children who have not mastered the Grade Four Achievement Test from sitting GSAT . <p> While 43,000 children were registered to sit GSAT earlier this year , another 6,000 were deemed ineligible because of functional illiteracy . <p> Under new arrangements to begin in September , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Programme ( ASTEP ) -- focusing on the development of basic literacy and numeracy skills for up to two years . <p> ASTEP is also meant to help students to develop self-esteem and engender positive thinking about self , family and community . <p> According to Nelson , the " sad thing " was that despite the handicap of having to cope with low achievers , " real progress " was being made at Cross Keys High when Tuesday 's tragedy struck . <p> A deliberate strategy was in place to develop innovative reading programmes and it had paid rich dividends . The institution of regular tests for all academic streams had helped to motivate study and healthy competition among students " because no one wants to fail " . A practice developed in recent years of rewarding high achievers with end-of-term trips to the beach and elsewhere , had aided motivation , he said . <p> Nelson spoke of the joy in the school community in 2009 when news came that three students had passed seven subjects at CXC level . That achievement was surpassed in 2010 , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday Observer by telephone , Nelson told of his pride on seeing students sitting under trees and studying , something , he claimed was virtually unheard of when he took over as principal five years ago . <p> The school 's mathematics programme had recently gained praise from the Ministry of Education . Its skills training programme , including electrical installation and furniture-making , had also gained acclaim . Over the last two years , he said , an e-learning programme -- following the acquisition of 60 computers -- has taken hold . The school has also made considerable strides in sport , particularly in table tennis and cricket , he said . <p> Journalist Glendon Baker who serves as vice-chairman of the school board underscored Nelson 's claims . " There can be no question that the school has made serious strides in terms of academic performance , " said Baker . <p> An emotional Nelson spoke of efforts by himself and his staff to provide " another chance " for students often considered irredeemable . In one case , he said , a young man had returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rape charge " . That young man ended up passing five CXCs " , said Nelson . <p> In another case , he said , a student who had been abandoned by his family and was living in an old broken down building was " rescued " by staff and teachers . He too gained five CXC passes . <p> Yet , despite the successes , Nelson spoke despairingly of elements among the student body who defied control , openly disrespecting teachers and fellow students and bringing the school into disrepute . Such disruptive behaviour , he suggested , was directly linked to the pain and frustration felt by low achievers . Only recently , he said he had warned his staff to be on the lookout for disruption from those whose poor grades would not allow them to graduate or sit exams . <p> He lamented that while the Cross Keys police try their best to help , resource constraints posed a hindrance . The Jamaica Constabulary Force 's assigned school 's resource officer was often unavailable , he said . <p> He confirmed that since Tuesday 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school . ' We have had discussions about implementing a multifaceted approach to enforcing school rules , " said Nelson . <p> He is among those hopeful that a Ministry of Education project to place " troubled " students in special institutions will take the pressure off schools such as Cross Keys . <p> The first such facility is tentatively set for opening across the road from Munro College , at Potsdam in the hills of Malvern , St Elizabeth , come September . <h> ADVERTISEMENT <p> POST A COMMENT <p> HOUSE RULES <p> 1 .

@@4530234 <h> A will , a ' jacket ' and a fight over property <p> My wife reads your column in the Observer and she thought I should write to you on this matter . My 83-year-old aunt has a property in Vineyard Town . Here are the details : <p> 1 . Her husband died in April 2010 and in his will he left her J$100 and all properties to other relatives . <p> 2 . The title to the Vineyard Town house is tenants-in-common between Mable ( my aunt ) and Frank ( the husband ) . <p> 3 . Frank willed 100 per cent of the house to his grand-niece . <p> 4 . Frank died at 90 and a 25-year-old young lady is now claiming to be his daughter and has advised of the following : <p> a . She is entitled to all her father 's property . <p> b . She will ' burn down " all properties if she does n't get her way . <p> This young lady 's mother has scared Frank 's agent who collects the rent , into giving her money . She says she is taking the matter to court to contest the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl is a ' jacket ' and she is not concerned about her and her legal claims . Frank 's lawyer refuses to speak to anyone and gives no information . My aunt and the grand-niece want to sell the house . They both live abroad ( Florida and Atlanta ) and have agreed . <p> We want to buy the property . What would be the best way to accomplish this given the various complexities of the matter ? <p> I have always felt that people who do what the deceased did by giving beneficiaries what can only be described as a slap in the face are so wrong . But then we have no idea why this man acted in such a wrong and terrible way towards his wife . If there was trouble in paradise , it generally takes two to tango and he ought to have dealt with whatever his grouse were during his lifetime and given her an opportunity to defend herself or explain her actions . With him dead he took this away from her and in effect left her to be ridiculed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightest respect for or appreciation of the years she spent as his wife . <p> Now let me give you practical legal answers to your queries . <p> Regarding numbers two and three of your letter , the provision in his will can not be upheld , as he did not have the whole legal and beneficial interest in the property . He only owned 50 per cent of it and your aunt still owns 50 per cent in her own right . You made it clear that they held the interests in the premises as tenants-in-common . He therefore had no right in fact or in law to purport to give away her property to someone else . Even if he had purported to assign her 50 per cent interest in the property to her in his will , this would be of no effect because the 50 per cent is already , in fact and in law , hers . <p> His attempt to devise all the interest in the property to his niece therefore fails . She can only get a part -- that is his 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legal owner of 50 per cent of the property and she is entitled , and has always been entitled , to 50 per cent of all rentals collected before his death and after his death . <p> Regarding number four , the young lady claiming to be his daughter is only doing that , claiming . She has no right to anything , unless she obtains a declaration of paternity which she must get by an application to a court , and would benefit only assuming he kept other property which he did not dispose of in his will . <p> Regarding 4a : No , she is certainly not entitled to all his property ! Even if she was his and your aunt 's daughter born in wedlock , she would not be entitled to all his property ! If she is indeed his child , she was it seems unacknowledged as such by him . She must therefore apply for and by evidence prove to a court of law that he was her father and obtain a declaration of paternity . <p> This , however , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his property ( his 50 per cent ) to his niece in his will and supposedly disposed of his other properties in his will . She can not challenge his will , as she was not an acknowledged child , nor can she apply for support pursuant to the Inheritance ( Provision for Family and Dependents ) Act 1993 , as she was clearly not dependent on him up to his death . <p> The person who can challenge his disposal of other properties in his will to others without any acknowledgement of her interest is your aunt . The Property ( Rights of Spouses ) Act enables her to apply to the court for a declaration of her interest in those other properties and order that she gets her share . <p> Regarding 4b : This threat to ' burn down ' all properties is clearly a stated intent to maliciously destroy property by committing arson , which is an offence . This ought to therefore be reported to the police as quickly as possible . <p> Her mother 's action which caused the agent to be so fearful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her , is clearly extortion -- also a crime that ought to be reported to the police . One-half of the rentals are rightfully your aunt 's money as she owns one-half of the property . <p> The young lady can take the matter to court , but as I have stated earlier , in my opinion she will not succeed . <p> Your aunt may be right and probably has the best attitude to this person 's claims . However , if she goes to court , her claim must be acknowledged and contested , because if not , she could get judgement in her favour by default , that is to say , because only her claims will be before the court . Her claims must therefore be answered and contested . She will , of course , have no locus standi -- that is the right to file the claim and be heard by the court -- unless she has a declaration of paternity . <p> Your aunt must get an attorney-at-law , who can make enquires in the court to discover whether an application has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also obtain a certified copy of the title of the Vineyard Town house from the Titles Office , to prove your aunt 's interest if she does not have the original Duplicate Certificate in her hands . Then , the attorney-at-law can also communicate with Frank 's lawyer ( of whom you mean the attorney-at- law for the estate ) who must reply , unless he/she wishes to breach our canons of ethics . <p> Your aunt 's attorney-at-law and the attorney for the grand-niece could apply on their behalf to the court for an interpretation of the will and for directions as to their respective proportional entitlements to the property and for an order that it be sold to you and your wife or that you and your wife may have the first option to purchase it , and if not , that it be sold by auction or private treaty and the net proceeds be apportioned to them in keeping with their interests therein . 
@@4530235 <h> She 's standing by her man <p> IT 'S a position powerful women like Hillary Rodham Clinton has been placed in before , and last week Anne Sinclair joined the list , forced to come out swinging against claims that her husband had raped a hotel maid . <p> The husband , Dominique Strauss-Kahn , who has since stepped down as head of the International Monetary Fund , was arrested and charged with a criminal sexual act , attempted rape and unlawful imprisonment . <p> It is early days yet to determine what will become of the Strauss-Kahn case , but Sinclair has made her support clear . <p> " I do not believe for one second the accusations brought against my husband . I have no doubt his innocence will be established , " Sinclair , a well-known television journalist , said in a statement last Sunday , while calling for decency and restraint in the wake of the recent scandal . <p> And last week , when Strauss-Kahn got bail , he also got a kiss from his wife . <p> Entering a courtroom where journalists crammed into all 100 or so public seats , Strauss-Kahn turned to exchange looks with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sitting in the front row , just a few steps away ... " the Associated Press reported . " Then during a break , Strauss-Kahn again stood up and turned to face the room , he smiled and blew a kiss from his hand . Then in a heartbeat , Sinclair raised her hand to her lips : she blew a kiss back . <p> " When Strauss-Kahn left -- away to spend his last night at Rikers Island -- he exchanged one more glance with Sinclair . It was a quiet , closed sort of look this time , a look full of secrets that only a husband and wife can know ... , " the report said . <p> Her stance describes a tableau the public has grown accustomed to , as wives of accused powerful businessmen , politicians , sports personalities and clergymen have declared their husband 's innocence during press conferences , court appearances and on talk shows . And while some might question the support of these women , even after allegations of crimes against other women , psychologist Dr Leachim Semaj asked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding is that a person is innocent until proven otherwise . The fact that there is a charge against the person does not mean that people who have known them all their lives and known them in other contexts should also make assumptions that that charge has now nullified everything they have know against the person , " he said . " That makes no sense at all . " <p> Despite claims of her husband 's infidelity , Rodham Clinton stood by former US president Bill Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal of the 90s . Even after overwhelming evidence proved his guilt , she went on public platforms condemning the " outrageous " stories and suggested her family was the victim of political conspiracy . <p> There were wives of other public figures who sat fashionably dressed under the public glare , as their husbands shared the details of their sordid affairs during press conferences meant to reaffirm their images as upstanding citizens . <p> Dina Matos McGreevey remained supportive after her husband , former New Jersey governor Jim outed himself as a gay ; and Silda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spitzer acknowledged he was the client of a call-girl ring . <p> When Idaho Senator Larry Craig denied trying to elicit sex from an undercover police officer in an airport men 's room , his wife Suzanne stoically stood by his side . Then there was Senator David Vitter whose wife Wendy dutifully stood with him during a news conference as he admitted to soliciting the services of another woman . <p> This is just in the political arena alone ; the wives of basketball players , businessmen and clergymen are too many to name . For these women , the experience can be embarrassing as they stand clothed with submissiveness and humility while their personal lives become topics for tabloids and salon conversations . <p> " There is a strong sense of embarrassment , but there is a thing in psychology called cognitive dissonance , that if you get to the point where you become part of the crowd which is now condemning this man who is your husband or your confidant or so on , it means now you have to re-evaluate all your life and be willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could I be such a fool to be with such a man all this while ?

In other words , the embarrassment might be lessened if she appears to the public as if the situation is not a problem and that she is not impaired by the indiscretions of her husband , " he said . " Public figures are particularly concerned about their image and will project an ' I am okay ' facade while they are hurting on the inside . They have mastered the art of pretence . They grin and bear it . " <p> But women like Elin Nordegren were not willing to " save face " and she gave Tiger Woods the boot when she learnt about his infidelities . Neither did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absent from her husband 's public confession about his affair with another woman . Instead , she issued a statement saying she had thrown him out and told him to stop speaking to her . <p> For those wives who are convinced of their husband 's infidelities but remain , Dr Semaj believes they do so after careful analysis of the individual who they have grown to know over the years . <p> You have known this person in all other kinds of contexts and they have done 10,000 other wonderful things for you . The fact that they did one transgression , for many people it does n't nullify the person 's total history . It is the father of your children ; it 's your husband for many years ... " the psychologist said . <p> But while some remain after this type of analysis , there are those who stay for other reasons . <p> " There is also the case where the wife is quite aware of the wayward ways of her husband but because she is totally dependent on him she has to put up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the good life and she ca n't afford to give up some benefit that he provides , be it financial , social or sexual . So she lives a life of denial and suffers deep emotional hurt , " Powell explained . <p> Dr Semaj , like many , is waiting to see what will come of the Strauss-Kahn case before offering any judgment . <p> " I am waiting to hear the details , all we are hearing about are charges , " he said . " It 's a very , very common thing that in the United States especially , the laws are so tipped to one direction , all a wife has to do is scream out and say her husband has threatened to hit her and he spends the next two nights in jail .

@@4533230 <h> Blueprint to literacy <p> Jamaica has been struggling with the problem of low literacy for quite some time , and it is commendable that teachers , school administrators , parents , and the nation 's policymakers have indeed identified the problems . <p> It is not in the least surprising that we all recognise the problem since people in general , and Jamaicans , in particular , are adept at finding the problem , but few are willing or able to put forward workable solutions . <p> Education Minister Andrew Holness has put forward the goal of achieving 100 per cent literacy by 2015 - a very ambitious goal indeed . And I guess that this goal is based on the assumption that all things are equal . Certainly , we in the education system know that , unfortunately , all things are not equal . This , however , is a topic that will be dealt with in another column , as I would like to deal specifically with the idea of helping educators understand that there is the distinct need for a national policy on improving literacy in our primary schools across the island . <p> MORE THAN ' MASTERY ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking that literacy among children is solely defined by their ability to achieve test scores which gives them ' mastery ' in the Grade Four Literacy Test . In fact , the way students interact with their environment , the people with whom they interact , and how they apply themselves to different situations are far more important in determining their level of literacy than achieving ' mastery ' or what we call acceptable test scores . <p> As usual , I want to keep it simple . Dr J Casey Hurley , in his book , The Six Virtues of the Educated Person , ( p. 45 ) states : " The educated person is one who develops understanding , imagination , strong character , courage , humility and generosity . " <p> From what I have seen in more than two decades in the profession , too many teachers spend too little time developing these virtues in the children under our care and are only concerned with test scores . Please rest assured that the scores will come if the virtues are taught . <p> Surely , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as educators , need to sit together and come up with a sustainable policy that will create more optimally rounded students . We need to establish in all schools minimum input standards by the practitioners . <p> Too often we see that there is wide disparity between the practices carried out by different schools , or even those carried out within the same schools by different teachers . Specifically , I would like to see a policy , for instance , where every classroom in Jamaica must have : a print-rich environment ; a computer ; memory gems displayed ; poems and songs displayed ; portfolio for the children ; motivational charts ; classroom library ; student journals ; records showing frequent and varied assessments ; display of students ' writing . <p> Wide-ranging research <p> Note that there is wide-ranging research out there to support the fact that writing improves reading , and hence , literacy . Too often we visit classrooms that are bare , lacking in print material , and having too little of what we can all agree will improve our literacy rate . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if utilised properly , could significantly improve the literacy rates in short order . These are certainly not the only ones , and I am , therefore , contending that policymakers , the Jamaica Teachers ' Association and educators alike , should do the necessary research , uniting around established essentials that drive literacy and institute policy that guides , systematically , how we will improve literacy among our young children . <p> Linked to this has to be the whole idea of insisting and ensuring that those teachers who continue to keep their jobs are those who adhere to the basic policy , while effectively imparting the curriculum to meet the diverse needs of our students . <p> I remember the days back in my primary school . We had to learn poems , memory verses , songs and a host of relevant general knowledge items . It is my concern that in today 's children , there exists a serious deficiency in these areas . I invite everyone concerned with achieving 100 per cent literacy by 2015 to think on these things . <p> The Gleaner welcomes your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's signature , scripted , printed or typed name , full address and telephone number where possible . <p> When submitting a pen name , kindly submit full name separately ; names and addresses will be withheld on request .

Born , and currently living in Rose Town , an inner-city community off Maxfield Avenue in St Andrew , where political violence has wreaked havoc on the lives of many and with gunshots and bloodshed having been commonplace , the eloquent and stylishly dressed Blake has risen above it all to be able to complete her bachelor 's degree at the University of the West Indies ( UWI ) , become a flight attendant , and own her own real estate company . <p> But even these achievements are not enough for Blake , who also does a myriad of social work in the community . <p> She is now looking forward to doing her MBA in social work and giving more to the community , which she migrated from immediately after completing high school , and returned to in 2002 . <p> " I was born in Maxfield and grew up there , and I guess you could say at the apex of the political war which would have been around ' 79/80 was when I literally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I left right after high school and just before university , " she said , explaining that she lived on the UWI campus . <p> " My growing up years there was nothing like what I came back to . " Blake explained . " When I was growing up there it was a normal , regular community ... there were people around me who were less fortunate but definitely not the level of deprivation that I see now . " <p> Now , one of the most alarming things for her is to see the number of children in the community who need an opportunity to be educated . <p> " What you have is a lot of children having children , so you have this whole heap of pickney , " Blake said . " In fact , when I came back here that was one of the first things that struck me . You saw all these children and it 's like you say ' wait a second , children and school go together ' , so you ask ' why you not in school ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunch money ' or whatever , and that is what got me going . The picture was wrong . " <p> Thus her social work began . Blake felt compelled to help these children get to school . This she did by using her own funding , funding from her network church , friends from corporate Jamaica and the Rotary Club of downtown Kingston . <p> " When I went back ( to the community ) my appeal to people was that $50 could make a difference to a child going to school . Because then $50 could at least get them something to eat . Those were the ones who did n't need much but just walked to school , and on that basis it was an attainable goal . " <p> Now she asks for $150 to $200 for lunch for a child per day , between $30 to $60 for transportation , and then a contribution towards individual needs like school shoes , uniforms and text books . <p> And while there is the educational needs of children that should be met , Blake also points to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There is the simple thing of going to church . It is not uncommon for me to be taking 20 to 25 children on a Sunday to church .

" <p> It is this need to help that has led her to form the Greater Maxfield and National Pickney Foundation ( GMNPF ) a year ago . It allows for a more structured approach and has the ability to pull in more resources and give more people the opportunity to help . <p> She said the work that she does requires economic viability where business principles can be applied to achieve the goal of making the foundation work .

" <p> Blake 's activities also include taking the children in her community on trips as some of whom have never seen the outside of the community . <p> " When I first went there , there were children who did not know Half-Way-Tree , " she explained . " There were those who did n't know anywhere really above Half-Way-Tree . And so that in itself may seem like nothing , but it 's a big thing .

We late already and we need to push on , " he said . <p> Nonetheless , working in conjunction with police outriders , the challenge of getting the convoy up to Manor Park , Constant Spring became almost a stroll in the park . There , scores of party supporters exhibited their orange gear to lend support to those on tour . <p> The noise decibels rose when PNP president Portia Simpson Miller came into full view . <p> Stony Hill square in West Rural St Andrew was a different scenario .

@@4533239 <h> Flying on the ' duppy ' airline <p> Once upon a time , our national airline was branded as ' the little piece of Jamaica that flies ' . These days , it 's the piece of Jamaica that has flown into the eager arms of Caribbean Airlines . Yes , I know we 're supposed to be celebrating the merger as a happy marriage . This is regional integration at its best , we 're told . <p> But I ca n't help feeling that this arranged marriage is not an act of pure love . Air Jamaica appears to have been sold off as an unattractive , pauperised bride . And her father - not ' Butch ' Stewart , but all of us taxpayers - have had to fork over a rather high dowry to Caribbean Airlines for the privilege of taking her off our hands . <p> I used to be a devoted Air Jamaica customer . The airline completely understood the Jamaican psyche . It accommodated all of our bag and baggage . Air Jamaica is the only airline I know that took head luggage and finger luggage . I once saw a woman on a flight with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us used to take on-board so many more bags than the regulation one piece of hand luggage !

That 's the most important thing . And no other pilot in the world can land a plane more gently than an Air Jamaica aviator . <p> But it was the hauling and pulling , particularly during peak holiday seasons , that taxed the loyalty of even the most faithful Air Jamaica passenger . One Christmas , after being ' batter-bruised ' by excruciatingly long delays , my sister , Donnette , came up with a wicked analogy to vent her frustration . <p> Flying with Air Jamaica was like being in a relationship with an abusive man .

My first ' choice ' was American Airlines . They now have the monopoly on the best routes out of Kingston . But because I was booking late , the fares were extortionate . I had n't realised that summer is ' dig-out-eye ' season and I was not prepared to pay over US$1,200 for an economy-class ticket . <p> So I was forced to contemplate the brave new world of ' cheap ' air travel . I first tried AirTran and got a quite decent fare from MoBay to DC and back to Miami . But I could n't understand why the fare from Miami to MoBay was almost double that of the entire outward route . Guess why ? The return flight was via Chicago ! So that was the end of that . <p> I next checked out Spirit , the notoriously cheap airline .

' , an exhibition which has been mounted at the Smithsonian 's Natural History Museum for the last four years . Curated by resident anthropologist Jake Homiak , it has attracted huge crowds . Dr Jahlani Niaah , a UWI colleague who is on a fellowship at the Smithsonian , completing his book on Rastafari masculinities , had invited me to the round table . <p> Quite frankly , I was one of the naysayers who had objected to the curator 's use of the exclamatory ' discovering ' . It imaged that presumptuous fiction of finding the peoples of the Americas who were not lost , like Columbus . It also turned Rastafari into exotic creatures on display . We did n't manage to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revisit the exhibition . <p> I also wanted to stop over in Fort Lauderdale for a family reunion . My paternal grandmother was a Dowdie , and the clan was gathering there . So I needed to make a multi-city booking . But because Spirit does n't offer that option online , I had to speak to an agent . I discovered that some of them specialise in misinformation . And that 's just the start of a rather long tale of woe . Suffice it to say , I took my maiden voyage on the ' duppy ' airline and the spirits rode me all night .

A blush pink Lana Bissett gown paired with matching rose quartz accessories by Island Gems and Bali Dreams and a feathered fascinator by Cinderella Hats , worn with Paris Hilton metallic fuchsia heels , reflected her eccentric fashion sense . She clutched a bohemian-inspired bouquet comprising pink roses , white feathers and pomegranates . <p> After a short ceremony officiated by Reverend Ambrose Hinds , the couple exchanged vows ahead of performing a ' Godknot ' unity ceremony , while the groom 's cousin , violinist Leticia Lewis , played Ribbon In The Sky .

" We are monitoring it ( because ) every epidemic starts on a small scale until it expands , " she said . <p> Campbell Grizzle explained that ecstasy is a ' cousin ' to the drug known as methamphetamine , because both of them are from the amphetamine class and both drugs have pseudo ephedrine as a precursor . <p> Ecstasy usually takes the form of a small tablet " but it packs a whack , " said Campbell Grizzle . <p> " It is a drug that makes you feel close to everybody and your guard comes down , " she added . <p> Meanwhile , Bernadette also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resorted to strange concoctions that include energy drinks and other uppers just to make it through their nightly ' ordeal ' . <p> " Sometimes when I drink the red bull and horse tonic it keeps me up all night into the daylight , " she said . <p> According to Bernadette , the emotional and psychological pressures associated with prostitution are oft unbearable , and pushes many of the sex workers to find coping mechanisms . <p> " There comes a point when you feel like you are nobody and you are angry but you got your kids and you have to eat , " she said . <p> It is also a heart-wrenching exercise .

@@4542240 <h> Rethinking the funding of tertiary education <p> In the presence of severe constraints on public expenditure and the generally accepted importance of education in social development and economic growth , the issue of funding education is one of the key issues that the newly elected administration will face in January . <p> The demand for tertiary education in Jamaica is on the rise because education is a key means of social mobility and access to wealth . The complaint from many is that tertiary education is expensive and so many qualified and deserving persons are unable to access higher education in Jamaica . While the Government has been a main source of funding for those who desire post-secondary education , given the tight fiscal constraints under which the Government is operating , there is little hope of an increase in the Government 's ability or willingness to fund tertiary education . Indeed , there has been a contraction ( adjusted for inflation ) in government expenditure on tertiary education between 2008 and 2009 . <p> Historically , government support for tertiary education was skewed towards the University of the West Indies ( UWI ) , Mona , which was Jamaica 's leading institution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of UWI 's role , its performance has been creditable in many areas , providing in large the management cadre for the labour force . With the emergence of other institutions of higher learning , the increasingly global nature of higher education , and concerns with UWI 's performance , calls have been made for the reconsideration of the funding model . A strong argument is that a more competitive and diverse market for higher education can only be beneficial . However , a more market-based approach runs the risk of further excluding the poor from access to tertiary education . <p> Some Key Findings <p> According to CaPRI 's 2009 report , Funding Tertiary Education in Jamaica , there are three competing imperatives relevant to the funding of tertiary education . <p> First , the funding model is failing to achieve its primary objective of helping poor households to afford higher education . Since the household income of university students is higher than the national average , the neediest persons are not the beneficiaries . Further , the typical student borrower from the Students ' Loan Bureau also comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to stand alongside anecdotal information of university students suffering deprivation towards completing their degrees . This indicates that the current funding model results in some getting more assistance than they need , while many of the neediest get no help . <p> The second consideration relevant to the debate around a funding model is that as many as four out of five university graduates migrate . This degree of brain drain is topped by only three other countries in the world . This means that Jamaica 's education funding model is , in effect , subsidising the economies of the USA , Canada , and Britain , which receive the majority of Jamaica 's educated migrants . The example of the USA is particularly striking - the Caribbean population with university degrees living there is more than twice the number at home . <p> The third imperative derives from the realisation that the future growth of the Jamaican economy depends on industries that are knowledge intensive . <p> Consequently , the labour force needs to include more tertiary-level educated persons . Cutting public funding for tertiary education is likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privately funded higher education system is not the best option as this will risk marginalising Jamaicans from poorer backgrounds who have made it into tertiary education through hard work and talent . <p> Furthermore , government maintains an interest in research , not just teaching , which is essential for the country 's economic competitiveness , innovation in various fields , cultural well-being and sound policy formulation . <p> An Alternative Approach <p> A possible way of reconciling these competing imperatives is with a funding model that separates teaching from research while shifting the burden of the cost of teaching to the principal consumers , the students , in a fashion that enhances access and expands higher education . Since research has external effects that benefit , not only the recipient of the education , but also the wider society , the Government has an interest in promoting as much of it as possible . This could be done , not by directly funding tertiary education , but by making grants available on a competitive basis to researchers and the institutions at which they work . <p> The administration that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transparent policy goals that can be met through the allocation of funds by disinterested granting agencies . These goals should go beyond simply economic efficiency , in order to incorporate areas such as a vibrant literary culture , developing critical reasoning and promoting ethical formation . This would mean that some tertiary institutions would be able to attract significant portions of their budgets from research grants , and could then support teaching functions with private funding . This would not mean that students will suddenly have to assume the full expense but would inevitably lead to a substantial increase in tuition fees . <p> Enabling students to absorb this increased expense while increasing the number of students who participate in higher education would require the newly elected government to provide additional funding for the student-loan scheme . The Government would need to continue to upfront the cost of students ' education , paying all interest for the duration of studies , including postgraduate , and for a brief transitional period after graduation . This transitional period would need to be increased from the current six months . Similarly , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maximum 10 years . At the same time , the Government still needs to keep graduates from migrating . Means of inducing them to remain at home or to repay the loan funds once they migrate are essential . A credit bureau would need to be created to monitor and enforce loan repayment once graduates are employed . This will prove somewhat more difficult for overseas migrants as it will be difficult to pursue repayment once they are abroad , unless the local credit bureau can liaise with overseas credit bureaus and flag graduates with outstanding loans in Jamaica . <p> Caribbean Policy Research Institute ( CaPRI ) is a not-for-profit public-policy think tank . CaPRI works to promote evidence-based dialogue on issues critical to socio-economic development in Jamaica and the region .
