@ <h> Brexit ' done ' at last -- now for the hard part <p> At the stroke of midnight in Brussels on Friday , Britain will leave the European Union and Prime Minister Boris Johnson will deliver on his election promise to " Get Brexit Done " . <p> But he wo n't have long to savor the triumph of a divorce that , over 3-1/2 years , shook British politics to the core and polarized the nation . Feb. 1 will mark the beginning of a new phase of negotiations between London and Brussels to agree on the shape of their future relationship . <p> They have until the end of 2020 -- a transition period during which Britain will remain an EU member in all but name -- to hammer out an agreement on trade and other issues including security , energy , transport links , fishing rights and data flow . <p> Johnson says 11 months is time enough to strike a " zero tariff , zero quota " trade deal and has vowed -- even though the option is there -- not to extend the limbo period beyond 2020 . <p> Cliff edge <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crippling no-deal Brexit that would leave trade between Britain and the EU based from 2021 on World Trade Organization terms that would impose import duties and controls . <p> EU Brexit adviser Stefaan De Rynck said this week that a cliff edge " remains a distinct possibility " because finding common ground by Dec. 31 will be harder than agreeing divorce terms as the two sides did in October , more than three years after Britons voted to leave the bloc in a referendum . <p> Trade agreements with the EU typically take years to complete , and few in Brussels believe the transition period will be long enough to seal more than a " bare bones " trade deal . <p> Fair competition <p> Getting more than that would be easier if Britain was willing to remain aligned with EU regulations , but London insists it will not be " a rule-taker " . <p> Britain 's concern is that keeping to EU rules would make it harder to strike trade agreements with other countries , especially the United States . <p> The EU says it will not seal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without solid provisions to guarantee fair competition . <p> Its demands will focus on " level playing field " issues -- environmental and labor standards , as well as state aid rules -- to ensure Britain would not be able to offer products on the bloc 's single market at unfairly low prices . <p> Sam Lowe of the Centre for European Reform think tank said Britain 's desire for full control of domestic regulation and trade policy will significantly limit the scope of any deal . <p> " At best , the EU and UK are on course to conclude a free trade agreement that removes all tariffs and quotas , but creates significant new administrative and regulatory barriers to trade in both goods and services , " he said . <p> Fish fight ahead <p> With industry supply chains in the EU currently crossing borders multiple times for products like cars and drugs , agreeing rules to designate where products come from -- and hence what regulations and taxes apply -- will be complicated . <p> But one of the biggest hazards on the road to a deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun . <p> Regaining control of Britain 's rich fishing waters was a totemic issue for many Brexit campaigners , but Brussels has linked access for EU boats to access to EU markets for Britain 's giant financial sector . <p> Just a few months <p> Although on paper the EU and Britain have 11 months to strike a deal on future relations , in reality the timeframe is much smaller . <p> Talks will not formally start until after EU governments agree a negotiating mandate late next month . <p> The two sides would then have to strike an agreement by the middle of October to leave time needed to translate the treaty into the EU 's 23 official languages and secure the required parliamentary ratification before year-end .

@@41809238 <h> Thanks ! <p> On a hot September evening in 2017 at Stockholm Fashion Week , Sweden 's stylish set was packed into a stifling venue for the closing party where a then-emerging South Korean DJ named Peggy Gou was spinning in a tiny side room . Only 25 years old , in the early days of her career , she was still lugging trunks of CDs around to her club dates -- more comfortable with the antiquated medium than the USB flash drives used by her peers -- while finding her footing in the techno and house scene . <p> On the main stage , Virgil Abloh , Off-White 's founder and now Louis Vuitton 's menswear artistic director , shared the spotlight with multi-platinum artist Kelis . No one , she was convinced , was going to turn up to listen to her . But one person did , and it was Abloh himself . <p> " He told me he was a fan and he wanted to say hi , " says Gou , still with a tone of disbelief . " I was floored . " <p> They might have been at different points in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many artists of their generation , unbridled ambition and a knack for weaving seamlessly between disciplines were qualities they shared . <p> " I really liked his attitude , " says Gou . " A friend of his wanted him to design a fitted suitcase for a car , and Virgil 's response was , ' No , I want to design the car . ' And that 's exactly me . That 's what I would say . " <p> On that fateful night , Abloh extended an invitation to Gou to DJ at his forthcoming Off-White x Dazed party in a London club on The Strand , where she met Claudio Antonioli and Davide De Giglio , the founders of streetwear conglomerate New Guards Group ( NGG ) . It was no ordinary encounter ; the Farfetch-owned company recently acquired Opening Ceremony and counts Off-White and Ambush under its umbrella . That evening , Gou joined their ranks . <h> Story continues below <h> Claim to Fame <p> Fast-forward three years , and Gou is now the proud owner of her own record label , Gudu Records ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giraffe , her favourite animal : " They 're so peaceful and calm -- the opposite of me " ) under NGG ; lucrative ambassadorship deals with the likes of Louis Vuitton ; and a screaming fanbase who can yell Korean lyrics from her 2018 hit single It Makes You Forget in deafening unison . <p> Tucked away in a cosy Seoul apartment on a brisk January afternoon , I catch up with Gou on the set of our photoshoot , somewhere between her two passions . She has one leg hiked up on the make-up chair as she hungrily devours tteok-bokki , a traditional Korean spicy rice cake dish , the first thing she craves on returning to her hometown . She cradles the fork to keep red sauce from dripping onto the denim racer jacket she 's wearing , from her debut Kirin collection . In town to DJ at a Jimmy Choo party , she had just flown in from a sold-out gig in Tokyo where the queue snaked around several blocks in Shinjuku -- and she still has a golden tan from a recent holiday in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wanted to just play two hours instead of three , but I pushed through in the end because the energy of the crowd was insane , " she says in the familiar husky voice found on her tracks , perhaps made deeper by the cold she 's nursing . But she 's otherwise highly animated , hands waving about as she reflects on her whirlwind career . <h> Eclectic Beginnings <p> Growing up , Gou 's musical education came from a combination of the classical scores she was taught during her piano lessons and listening to analogue tunes from old Korean pop songs on her parents ' radio . " That 's where I get my inspiration for my lyrics , " she says . " They were just so much more poetic , so I use words in my songs now that young people probably have never heard of . " <p> In her school bag she always carried a Walkman and edgy stockings or socks to jazz up her uniform once she was at school -- and away from her mother 's watchful gaze . " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she bought me , " she says . " I always had a strong personal taste in my style ; I just wanted to collect what was cool . " In fact , she first pursued a career in styling at London College of Fashion , and even interned at Harper 's Bazaar Korea , but soon realised she was neither interested in nor particularly skilled at dressing others . " It just did n't make my heart beat fast enough , " she says . <p> There are so many beautiful things about Korea that I want people to look at and reflect on . <h> Turning Tables <p> Meanwhile , Gou discovered the DJ scene thanks to her boyfriend at the time -- a DJ from whom she learned beatmatching and digging -- and her love of frequenting dance clubs like London 's Plastic People every weekend . Before long , her growing network of music industry friends egged her on to try her hand behind the decks , leading to her first-ever gig at the Soho club Cirque Le Soir . <p> " I honestly do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole night with my head in the mixer , too scared to look anywhere , " she recalls . A few years later , she became the first female Korean DJ to play at the notoriously exclusive Berlin techno club Berghain . <p> Even with five EPs and gigs at global festivals like Coachella and Glastonbury under her belt , Gou still feels nervous before every show . " For me , my career is like a sport , and doing sports should n't be comfortable , " she says . " You have to push yourself to the point of discomfort to feel like you had a good workout . So I think it 's good that I still get the butterflies , or else it means I do n't care any more and that I have to find something else that gives me butterflies . " <h> Inimitable Style <p> When NGG came knocking , prophesying that they " saw Virgil in her , " she says , the idea of starting her own fashion label made her feel just as queasy , which was reason enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gou said she simply wanted to create clothes she would wear . At the same time , she found it challenging to describe her own style -- until , that is , she discovered her signature look had become so recognisable among clubbers and social-media followers that some of them wore Peggy Gou costumes one Halloween . <p> " That year , a lot of people were wearing a tropical shirt , sunglasses and holding a stuffed giraffe , " she says . So , by popular demand , she dreamed up silk Cuban shirts with prints of haetae , a mythical , tiger-like Korean creature , smiley faces from acid house music and two-piece pyjama or denim sets like those she favoured for festivals . <p> To celebrate underexposed parts of her culture , Gou decided to use Asian silk fabrics for some of her logo-print sets , as well as traditional Korean motifs . And she began singing in Korean on her tracks , coining her own genre , " K-House . " Her first music video , for Starry Night , directed by her partner , Jonas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ladies in hanbok -- all breaking out in modern dance . <p> " I was afraid people would n't like it at first , but I always believe that you do n't know until you try , " she says . " And now it 's become my signature . I see so many Asian artists try to copy what the Europeans do , but there are so many beautiful things about Korea that I want people to look at and reflect on and appreciate . " <p> Photo : Tak Sugita for Tatler Hong Kong <h> A Certain Je Ne Sais Quoi <p> Like many people whom their contemporaries deem " cool , " there 's something decidedly uncalculated about each move Gou makes . She , like Abloh , is able to seamlessly direct her fanbase -- the " Goucci Gang " -- of more than a million ( she has 1.4 million Instagram followers and counting ) towards whatever endeavour she next chooses . <p> " I never think about forging a style or aesthetic ; it 's just my taste , what I like , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I 'm good at and what I 'm not . If I know I ca n't kill it , I 'll just move on . " <p> This is already proving to be an eventful year , with Gou building a recording studio in her newly purchased house in Berlin , where she will be producing a new album , before headlining Coachella this April .

@@41883231 <h> Thanks ! <p> The end of 2019 brought a deluge of articles trying to nail the most important wine trends of the past decade . Plaudits were handed to ros ? and natural wine , while Prosecco and its imitators could n't be denied their place . Having waded through more of these articles than I 'd care to admit , the question I was left with is what we should look for going forward . Beyond the perennially popular classics , what styles should we be choosing to spice up our Wednesday dinners or the next BYO ? <p> Rather than get overly ambitious and make grand prognostications for the coming decade , my first effort is a shortlist of categories I think everyone should try at least once this year . Included are regions that emerged from the twenty-teens more clearly delineated and " mature " than they entered -- see Hawke 's Bay 's increasingly brilliant syrahs -- or that are overdue for a second look -- see the unfairly dismissed treasure trove that is classic Napa Valley cabernet sauvignon . <p> To be considered , each region had to have more than just one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact desirable diversity within the category , a unique and cohesive identity . To try to capture the essence of each of these promising styles , I 've created an accompanying Visual Tasting Note and made a few suggestions of producers or individual wines to try . Hope you enjoy exploring these categories as much as I did " researching " them ! <h> 1/5Blanc de Noirs champagne <p> Illustration : Sarah Heller <p> Where : Champagne , France <p> What : sparkling <p> Why : Literally a white made only from black-skinned grapes , this style of champagne has emerged from the shadow of the more traditionally prized blanc de blancs ( made only from white-skinned grapes ) to add dimension and depth to a category that most people view exclusively in terms of brands and price points . Typically it has been embraced by growers ( i.e. producers who grow all their own grapes and process them from start to finish , distinguishable by the letters " RM " on the label ) like Egly-Ouriet and C ? dric Bouchard , whose production philosophy tends to emphasize uniqueness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the houses ( i.e. producers who buy grapes , juice or wine that they then market and sell , marked with " NM " on the label ) , like Mo ? t &amp; Chandon , Veuve Clicquot , Piper-Heidsieck , and other familiar names . <p> Since the grapes in question , pinot noir and meunier , both bring greater weight and fullness to the classic champagne blend where they are used offset the racy delicacy of chardonnay , these wines tend to be more robust , structured and " vinous " than blanc de blancs . Fruit flavours tend to be darker and richer though not necessarily " redder " since the red grape skins are barely involved in the process . Complexity comes in the form of " base notes " you might expect in a gender neutral perfume , like chypre or sandalwood , layered with pastry and brown spices , sometimes showing idiosyncratic earthy or even animal notes . <p> Meunier-only versions are particularly in vogue among the Champagne avant-garde , favoured for their generous fruit enlivened by an almost briny savouriness . A final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perdix , brings an added layer of tart cherry fruit that bridges the gap between these and ros ? champagne . <p> Why : The region also known as Green Spain for its moist , Atlantic freshened landscape has been turning the image of Spanish whites , long disregarded as oxidised and uninteresting , on its head . A grape that typifies the " narrow escape from extinction " narrative , Galicia 's godello has risen on steep terraced slopes from near annihilation in the 1970s to become a sleeper hit that has almost overshadowed that other Galician white , albari ? o . <p> Much less overtly aromatic than its more coastal rival , godello shines for its ineffable aromas and sensual textures , ranging from slightly oily to creamy to baroquely waxy , but always firmly anchored by a central spear of acidity . This is often enriched by careful working of the lees that can bring out everything from a subtle smokiness to an almost oaken toastiness , evoking nothing so much as white Burgundy . Leaner examples tend to be greener in their expression with crisp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality and a sobering bitterness on the finish . <h> 3/5Etna Rosso <p> Illustration : Sarah Heller <p> Where : Sicily , Italy <p> What : Still red <p> Why : Apart from the sheer romance of wines grown on a moonscape-like , jet black volcano with some of Italy 's highest vineyard sites ( up to 1000m above sea level ) , Etna Rosso has captivated wine cognoscenti the world over for its lightness of being and silky caress belied by a tense grasp beneath , as well as a chimeric ability to develop sheer , lustrous layers of flavour over time . The inherent drama of trying to cultivate vines on an active volcano -- vineyards are occasionally buried under fresh lava flows -- is offset by the rich multiplicity of sites that results , best expressed in single-vineyard or " contrada " wines . Finally , the use of a single primary grape -- nerello mascalese -- that is little known outside of the region has only added to its allure . <p> Called the " Burgundy of Italy " by some , I think of Etna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italy for its exquisite combination of pleasure and tongue-wrenching sadism . Where the " earthy " smells of Burgundy often bring to mind lush moss and lovingly worm-turned humus , Etna 's " mineral " qualities are far harsher and more angular , channelling fresh-laid asphalt , sauna stones and sizzling tarmac ( but in the loveliest possible way ) . <h> 4/5Hawke 's Bay Syrah <p> Illustration : Sarah Heller <p> Where : North Island , New Zealand <p> What : Still red <p> Why : Long overshadowed by the region 's Bordeaux blends and massively outgunned by Australian Shiraz in their domestic and export markets , these shimmering gemstones of peppery , purple-berried delight are worth making an extra effort to seek out . The most prestigious address within Hawke 's Bay is Gimblett Gravels , favoured for its well-drained cobblestone soils , but cooler sites around the region , particularly hillside terraces , are yielding exciting examples . <p> Occasionally almost indistinguishable from northern Rhone treasures like C ? te-R ? tie or St Joseph , these wines have gained a concentration and generosity in their fruit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the wines they initially emulated so closely . Always more redolent of white pepper than black and sprinkled with candied violets , this initial iridescent glimmer of aroma gives way to a meaty tapenade and saddle leather savour , always remaining just this side of " dirty . " <h> 5/5Classic Napa cab : Heitz Martha 's Vineyard <p> Illustration : Sarah Heller <p> Where : California , USA <p> What : Still red <p> Why : Lest we get too carried away with esoteric styles and lesser-known regions , its worth taking stock of the wines that made our " great regions " great in the first place . Napa has been tarred with a ( sometimes fair ) reputation for American maximalism and a loss of subtlety but it 's far from time to write it off . For one thing , there are the many cabs from the more classical days of the 1970s and 1980s have held onto their fruit so impressively that I 've often opened them and been befuddled by their apparent youthfulness . <p> While accepting climate realities demands that we admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at least in core Napa , some of that increased volume and density has not been the work of a warming climate alone . We can look to less overtly ambitious wines that have n't had the hangtime , extraction and oak lavishing of top bottles , like many producers ' estate Cabernets ( i.e. their " entry level " bottles , still normally a good US$50 retail ) . These often have a freshness and vibrancy to their cassis fruit , a judicious and proportionate velvetiness to their tannins and a brilliance to their acidity than makes the mouth salivate , while retaining a distinctively effulgent Napa-ness that would never make these a dupe for Bordeaux or anything else . However , there are also those in the rich and luscious camp that have managed to hold onto a sense of proportion , demonstrating amply that size and grace can happily co-exist .

It is pure determination that will push him to face his phobia of heights again and again as cameras roll continually . He wants the world to be scared too -- only for a different reason . <p> Leeson 's 2016 documentary A Plastic Ocean shed light on how single-use items were polluting the planet . For his next project , the Hong Kong-based filmmaker and journalist swapped his snorkel for skis to document another environmental catastrophe for his next documentary -- The Last Glaciers , set to premiere this year . In his determination to bring a bird 's eye view of melting rivers of ice to as many screens as possible , Leeson became a licensed paraglider , traversed knife-edged alpine ridges in punishing conditions and summited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the deadliest in the world . <p> His new film actually began as a documentary about para-alpinism -- an extreme sport that sees climbers scale mountains and then paraglide off their peaks -- but Leeson 's attention quickly turned to the changing environment he encountered , and then his mission , he decided , should be to sound the alarm over the thawing of the world 's ice caps . <p> " It was the middle of winter and I 'd gone to Val D'Is ? re , " says Leeson . " But it seemed odd to me that high up in the French alps , there was no snow , very little ice and it was n't really cold . I started talking to a lot of guides and people around the town and found that temperatures had been rising and glaciers melting over the last 20 to 30 years . " <p> Most of the earth 's supply of freshwater is stored as glacial ice , which covers about 10 per cent of its land surface . Bubbles of gas in these glaciers offer clues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of years . While giving a corporate lecture on plastic soon after his trip to Val D'Is ? re , Leeson met leading French glaciologist J ? r ? me Chappellaz , whose work on ice cores has provided evidence that carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have a strong influence on climate change -- evidence that is being destroyed as a warming planet causes the vast rivers of ice at high altitudes to retreat by as much as one metre every year . <p> Learning about the loss of ice was " a lightbulb moment " for Leeson , who felt that the problem was neither being addressed nor publicised with the appropriate level of urgency . <h> Lofty Goals <p> The war on plastic has a clear cause , consequence and objective . Photographs of strangled turtles and tides of trash are unambiguous calls to action that provoke emotional responses to a problem increasingly on our doorsteps . Championed by wildlife broadcaster David Attenborough as " one of the most important films of our time " , A Plastic Ocean created a shockwave that has driven entire industries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand less wasteful business practices . <p> Ice caps , on the other hand , present a more abstract concern ; they 're far away and hard to reach for most . The link between human emissions and these remote regions is complex and hard to capture in a film that non-scientists will want to watch . Al Gore succeeded in bringing phrases like " greenhouse gases " and " global warming " into the public lexicon with An Inconvenient Truth in 2006 , but the pace of governments ' efforts to prevent the rise in temperatures that threatens to annihilate our species and most living creatures has been , well ... glacial . <p> The UN 's State of the Climate report released in March depicts a shocking state of accelerating climate change , with melting ice linked to rising sea levels and knock-on effects on human migration , food security and marine life . Last year was the second warmest on record , while the period from 2015 to 2019 was the warmest five years ever . Glaciers were shown to have shrunk for the 32nd consecutive year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spike in carbon emissions , further entrenching the problem . <h> Story continues below <p> " We 've got the facts and yet we continue to go on as though nothing 's happening , " says Leeson , anger rising in his voice . " That 's what drives me with this film : the need to shake people and wake them up ; to shake political leaders and say to them , ' Listen , you guys have got families , you 've got kids . This is their future . You 're not gambling with it : a gamble indicates that you know that the result could go either way ; this is actually going to happen . We 're reaching this tipping point . And we know that it 's going to collapse life support systems . Yet we 're continuing to make decisions that are not altering that course that we 're on . " <h> Up Close <p> The Last Glaciers presents a global issue through a lens of personal struggle . During filming , the Malibu home of executive producer William Pfeiffer burned down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is slowly becoming inhospitable due to more frequent fires and water shortages caused by extreme heat . <p> The worst tragedy , albeit not one directly related to climate change , rocked the project last summer when cinematographer Cody Tuttle died in a paragliding accident in the Sierra Nevada while training for aerial shooting . Instead of halting production , the team pressed on , with part of the documentary dedicated to the memory of Tuttle , a noted environmentalist and humanitarian . <p> " We had a lot of difficulties along the way in terms of making the film , both emotionally and logistically , " says Leeson . " But that 's part of the story . We 're telling those stories within the film so that people understand its urgency and how important the issue is , and also the people who were involved in the making of the film still want it to go ahead despite their own personal losses -- all because of the message . " <h> Off the Beaten Track <p> Leeson could have taken an easier route through life : his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the western quadrant of Tasmania . Growing up in the ' 70s as a surf- and guitar-obsessed child who loved animals , Leeson had no interest in getting an office job , but was persuaded by his father , Allan , that journalism might be a good fallback . As it turned out , Leeson had the family flair for spinning a yarn , but felt guilty that connection had got him into the paper and yearned to grow his career on his own terms . The bright lights and adrenaline rush of broadcasting appealed : first radio , then television as Leeson -- tall and athletic with a chiselled jaw and commanding gaze -- became evening news anchor for ABC News in Tasmania . <p> Joseph shirt , Dunhill coat ( Photo : Oliver Yoan for Tatler Hong Kong ) <p> Travelling through China in the ' 90s piqued his interest in Asia , which led him to relocate to Hong Kong as the 1997 handover approached , covering politics throughout the region . But as the East Timor war began and a new millennium loomed , fatigue set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'd just seen enough " , he says . After a few years of bouncing around , learning to fly fixed-wing aircraft in Miami , working for the National Geographic channel in Hong Kong , and a lucrative stint as a telecom strategist , he started his own production company , Ocean Vista Films , named after the suburb of Burnie he grew up in . <h> Bold Beginnings <p> Burnie -- population 30,000 -- clings to the inside of Tasmania 's northwestern fletching , and was declared a city by Queen Elizabeth II just as Leeson was entering adulthood . This " city of makers " has fought to distance itself from a heavy industrial past ; a paper mill , paint pigment factory and slaughterhouse brought prosperity and droves of workers to the port -- as well as pollution . <p> " We did n't have clear blue water growing up , " Leeson says . " When the weather would turn easterly , it would blow this effluent from the plants straight into the surf club beach , and your eyes would just go red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would make you physically ill . But these industries paid extremely good wages . " <p> In an investigation for The Advocate in the mid ' 80s , Leeson found that the state government was aware of carcinogenic chemicals in the water but had not demanded better waste management from factories . The story went viral , gaining Burnie a reputation as the nation 's dirtiest town and bringing an increased level of scrutiny that saw its dirtiest polluters legislated out of existence in the decade that followed . <p> " I learned the power of storytelling very quickly , " says Leeson . " It was a great way of seeing how it can completely turn an environment around in a way that benefits the community as well . It gave me a real sense of the potential of being a journalist . " <h> The Power of Stories <p> Leeson 's stoic demeanour belies a storyteller who is n't too hardened by three decades reporting on heavy-hitting topics to be moved by scenes of grandeur in nature , or too serious-minded to see the funny side of filming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defecated on by a whale ( a scene from A Plastic Ocean that was sadly relegated to the cutting-room floor ) to scoop up a bucket of the orange faeces " for science " , giving marine biologists who were onboard a new line of research into the eating habits and microbiomes of the world 's largest and most elusive mammals . <p> Leeson 's work has seen him speak alongside climate campaigner Greta Thunberg at the World Economic Forum and advise for the British Plastics Federation . However , he rejects the term " activist " , insisting that his job is to show his audience evidence and leave them to draw their own conclusions . To switch off , he dives , surfs and swims , and rocks out on stage with his band , Uranus . He might not be a strict vegan or adhere to a spartan lifestyle , but avoids plastic and red meat and invests in carbon offsetting programmes . " I 'm all sorts of things : I am a historian ; I 'm a storyteller ; I 'm a journalist ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the moment are environmentally focused because I think they 're important stories that need to be told , " he says . <p> Leeson was adamant that The Last Glaciers -- like A Plastic Ocean before it -- needed to be shot on cinema-quality cameras . Difficult to use underwater and harder still to lug up mountains , the cameras represent Leeson 's steadfast commitment to creating the kind of immersive images that linger in viewers ' minds after credits have rolled -- they also turn the documentaries into theatrical events people are willing to pay to see . It paid off with A Plastic Ocean , which has been screened in more than 70 countries and has won its creator several armfuls of awards . And The Last Glaciers is sure to be similarly hard to turn away from when it premieres this year . <p> After that ? You 'll find Leeson in his natural habitat for a while , the waves around his feet and a guitar strung across his body as he waits for the next cause to demand his lens . Whatever he puts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see it through .

Because if we do n't , competitors who do n't share our values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ void , " according to a White House note by President Barack Obama . <p> The TPP sets new and high standards for global trade deals . It involves the free flow of personnel and capital , protection of intellectual property rights , labor and environmental protection , and restrictions on preferential policies for state-owned enterprises , which have never been covered by any past trade agreements . <p> In the meantime , China could launch its own trade agreement talks . For example , Beijing has been trying to push for a Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership ( RCEP ) with India . <p> The idea emerged from the leaders ' summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in 2011 . The 10-member group invited six nations including China , Japan , South Korea , Australia , New Zealand and India to join the trade group . <p> The agreement intends to build a free trade pact among 16 nations through tariff reductions and elimination of non-tariff barriers . <p> However , I 'm not very optimistic about the prospects of RCEP . Opening the services sector will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservative in opening its markets to China . The RCEP also lacks the massive US market . <p> Therefore , I believe China should join the TPP , which will be beneficial to the nation 's long-term interests . <p> China needs to meet various high standards in order to join the free-trade bloc . That could be a driving force for the nation 's internal reforms . <p> Before China 's entry into the WTO , some people voiced concerns about the impact of lower tariff and market opening on its economy . <p> As it turned out , the WTO membership forced domestic companies to beef up their competitiveness and helped accelerate China 's reform . <p> Many of China 's reforms have been held back by vested interest groups . Joining mutually beneficial external trade agreements could drive internal reforms .

@@41952230 <h> Coronavirus further poisons relations between China and Taiwan <p> The coronavirus has poisoned already bad relations between the mainland and Taiwan . Instead of bringing the two together to fight a common enemy , the epidemic has driven them further apart . <p> The Taiwan government , and its people , are angry over China 's refusal to allow it to join the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) , even during such an emergency . This resulted in Taiwan people being banned from countries which thought they were from the PRC . Some in Taiwan have renamed the institution CHO -- China Health Organisation . <p> Another bitter conflict has been the delay in repatriating Taiwan people from Wuhan , centre of the epidemic . While French , Americans , Japanese and other nationalities left quickly on chartered flights , some Taiwan residents were trapped for more than two months . <p> Now another front has opened in the battle -- last Thursday Beijing 's Ministry of Education announced it would ban students from studying in Taiwan in the semester beginning in September " because of the pandemic and cross-straits relations " . Nearly 8,000 mainland students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are currently on the island . <p> The first case in Taiwan was recorded on January 21 , when a 50-year-old woman who returned from her teaching job in Wuhan reported her illness . She was hospitalised . The first domestic case was on January 26 and the first death on February 16 . <p> Taiwan was , with Hong Kong , the most exposed to a mass infection . Mainlanders are its largest group of tourists and business travellers ; more than one million Taiwan living in the mainland were likely to want to return home . <p> The government acted decisively . It used data from its national health system , immigration and customs to identify carriers , screen flights from the mainland and track individual cases . As from March 19 , it banned foreigners from entering the island , with a few exceptions . <p> It was helped by its experience of the SARS outbreak in 2002/2003 and the fact that Vice President Chen Chien-jen ( ? ? ? ) is an epidemiologist ; he was Minister of Health during SARS . As of April 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority showing negative . <p> As a result , it has been one of the safest places in the world , with just 388 cases and six deaths as of April 12 . It has earned international praise for its prevention measures . <p> But it has not been a smooth ride . Taiwan was excluded from the WHO at the demand of Beijing . After the epidemic began , it urgently requested that it be readmitted , but to no avail . Many countries , including Italy , Vietnam and the Philippines , briefly banned flights from Taiwan in January and February , even though the virus had not reached epidemic status on the island . They believed Taiwan people came from the PRC . <p> " Taiwan is at the forefront of global epidemic prevention . There needs to be room at the WHO for Taiwan 's participation , " President Tsai Ing-wen ( ? ? ? ) said in January . <p> For its part , Beijing says it passes relevant information to Taipei and that no-one cares more about Taiwan people than the central government . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United Nations , also rejected Taiwan 's request to join . It was excluded in 2013 . <p> These exclusions enrage the Taiwan public , who see Beijing puttingpolitics and ideology above their health and safety . They play into the narrative of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party ( DPP ) , which says that the mainland is a hostile power . <p> Another cause of anger was the plight of Taiwan residents of Wuhan . While both sides agreed in principle to their evacuation , disputes over who should leave and what planes they should fly delayed the departure . Flights left on February 3 , 21 and March 10 . The most recent one , carrying 153 Taiwan people and their families , arrived home on March 29 -- more than two months after the lockdown . <p> On the first flight , one passenger was confirmed with the virus and three others had fever . Their presence " created a tear in virus prevention " , said Taiwan 's Mainland Affairs Council . <p> Such is the public hostility to China that , when the opposition Kuomintang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new chairman on March 7 , he made no mention in his acceptance speech of the " 9.22 " consensus which China regards as the basis for cross-straits relations . <p> This means that Beijing now has no interlocutor in Taiwan . <p> Tsai has been eager to build on the international goodwill created by its control of the virus . Taiwan is donating 16 million surgical masks to the U.S. , European nations , Australia , New Zealand . and countries in the Caribbean , Latin America and Southeast Asia . <p> The first seven million , for Europe , arrived in Luxembourg and Frankfurt on April 9 in two cargo planes . " Taiwan can play an indispensable role in overcoming coronavirus , " its Foreign Ministry said . <p> This level of donation is higher than that given by China . <p> Cross-straits relations have been deteriorating since Tsai was first elected in 2016 .

It is a national champion among industries the ruling Communist Party is promoting in hopes of transforming China into a global competitor in profitable technologies . <p> China 's Ministry of Commerce warned today it will protect " the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises , " but gave no details of potential retaliation . Beijing has threatened in the past to issue an " unreliable entities list " that might restrict operations of American companies in China . <p> Friction over Huawei adds to a broader deterioration of U.S.-Chinese relations . <p> The two sides have declared a truce in a trade war , but arguments over the origin of the coronavirus pandemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement might fall apart . <p> Huawei is at the center of the U.S.-Chinese conflict over Beijing 's technology ambitions , which Washington worries might erode American industrial leadership . <p> Huawei has few alternatives if Washington refuses to allow its suppliers to use U.S. technology . The company has developed some of its own chips but even the biggest non-U.S . manufacturers such as Taiwanese giant TSMC need American components or production equipment . <p> " Every electronics system that Huawei produces could be negatively impacted , " Jim Handy , semiconductor analyst for Objective Analysis , said in an email .

The company spends tens of billions of dollars a year on components and technology from U.S. and other suppliers , purchases that might be disrupted if output of smartphones and other products is blocked . <p> U.S. suppliers already have complained to Washington that restrictions imposed last May on Huawei 's access to American components and other technology will cost them billions of dollars in lost potential sales . <p> The company 's telecoms market in the U.S. evaporated after a congressional panel in 2012 labeled Huawei and its Chinese competitor ZTE Corp . security risks and told phone carriers to avoid them . <p> Last year 's sanctions require U.S. companies to obtain government permission to sell chips and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Android operating system on its smartphones but lost the ability to pre-install music , maps and other Google services customers expect on phones . <p> Huawei has launched its own smartphone operating system and is paying developers to create apps to run on it .

@@42024240 <h> Can the Hong Kong establishment at least pretend to be rational about violence ? <p> " The agent of economic theory is rational , selfish and his tastes do not change , " according to Bruno Fey , and this may be one reason why economic theory has few points of contact with the real world . <p> People are not rational and consistent . I will leave the question of selfishness for another day . We generally expect , though , that people should make an effort to be rational and consistent , particularly when they are in positions which involve making decisions for the rest of us . <p> Hong Kong people . Photo : Wikicommons . <p> But this is not what we get . Consider the matter of violence . We all disapprove of violence . We also all recognise that violence comes on a scale , with varying degrees of seriousness , depending mainly on the effect on the victim but also taking other circumstances into account . <p> So we might have at one end of the scale a pat on the back which would in other circumstances qualify as a sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your pick -- public executions by hanging , drawing and quartering , perhaps . <p> Where on this scale might we place the mischief of Mr Ted Hui who , irked by the presence in Legco 's backstage areas of officials apparently photographing the scene-shifting on mobile phones , grabbed a phone from one of the snoopers . <p> File photo : Citizen News . <p> Taking advantage of the snooper 's female gender he retired to the nearest gents ' latrine to -- or so one assumes -- have a quick look at the " gallery " section and see if he was one of the unwilling stars of it . <p> We can I think infer that the violence part of this was quite low down the scale . Our prosecutors , ever anxious to add another pro-dem scalp to their trophy cabinet , have settled for " common assault " for the snatching part . The proceedings in the toilet qualify for that much-loved legal blunderbuss , " accessing a computer with dishonest intent . " <p> It was suggested at the time that the victim was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though I realise that digital natives ( or young people as we used to call them ) have an affection for , if not an addiction to , their mobile phones which is difficult to understand for those of us who first met phones when they were large pieces of black Bakelite with a round dial and a wire going into the wall . <p> Perhaps she jumped to the conclusion that Mr Hui 's trip to the toilet would end with him dropping the offending phone in a place from which recovery would be unpleasant , if not impossible . <p> Perhaps the phone , which was on official business , was an official phone , whose loss would entail extensive form-filling and recriminations . Anyway I think we can all agree that it was naughty of Mr Hui to cause a lady such distress , whatever the legal status ( still to be determined in court ) of his actions . But as a piece of violence it hardly registers on the Mayhem Meter . <p> Carrie Lam . Photo : Tom Grundy/HKFP . <p> The government 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr Hui 's conduct was " barbaric " . This seems to be the most conspicuous local example of over-inflated rhetoric since the last time some sycophant said that C.Y. Leung would make a good Chief Executive . <p> If we are going to use " barbaric " for snatching a lady 's mobile phone , what will we have in reserve for occasions when the victim is killed and eaten ? <p> What will be have in reserve if the victim is roughed up , has his nose rubbed along the pavement , is whisked off to the local police station and coerced into coughing up one of those " confessions " which we all take with a pinch of salt ? <p> Well when it happens in Beijing , it seems , words rather fail us . The Chief Executive managed to " express regret " . The Secretary for Justice thought the actions of the policemen concerned were " very strange " . You what ? <p> The whole point of having a lawyer as Secretary for Justice is that there are times then the government and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . Telling us that the actions of the police were " very strange " is like going to you doctor and being told that the mysterious growth on your neck is " very decorative " . That may be true but it is not what we want to know . <p> Actually I doubt if it is true that the police action was " very strange " . The mainland police are not like our police . Not yet . It is a commonplace there of reporting ( along with demonstrating , protesting , worshipping in the wrong church and other controversial actions ) that you may be beaten up by policemen . <p> One of my former colleagues had such a rough time covering a protest in Tiananmen Square that his back was permanently damaged . That 's the way it goes . Those who are taken into police stations commonly emerge on a stretcher , occasionally in a box . <p> Carrie Lam says she hopes that people will not expect the government to " use certain wording to show that it cares " . Not at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We would just like to see it pretending . <p> Of course senior officials do not have a monopoly on baffling inconsistency . Earlier this month , legislators were much excited by the news that tickets for the Flying White Elephant , or the Express Rail Link as we are supposed to call it , would come in two categories . Those for destinations served by trains starting in Hong Kong and finishing in that destination could be bought from the MTR . Those for other places on the network would have to be bought from the mainland rail system or an agent of it . <p> And ( surprise ! ) the agent will add a small fee to the cost of the ticket . So legislators who happily swallowed the bill for the world 's most expensive railway were upset that travellers on this marvel might be ripped off a few bucks by the China Travel Service . <p> Photo : GovHK . <p> I am reminded of the passage in one of Parkinson 's books in which he points out that the building of a new power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because few people present know enough about it to comment , while the construction of a bicycle shed will take an hour because everyone has an opinion . <p> The rail link is a hole down which billions of dollars have been poured and will continue to flow . Even in the original proposal it was never going to make money on a normal basis because it was never expected to pay its construction costs . <p> For book-keeping purposes the rail link is treated as if a choir of angels had descended on us and built the thing for nothing . <p> Honestly accounted for it will , as I have said before , have cost HK$100 billion . You no longer have to take my word for this . In the debate on the Great Ticket Robbery Mr Michael Tien , a rare railway-literate legislator , explained that " It 's just like buying the side dish for $100 billion and when you purchase the side dish you ca n't book the main course at the same time .

@@42056234 <p> Lawmakers constantly jockey for top spots in influential committees , and clashes between the pro-Beijing and pro-democracy camps are nothing new . However , before Monday it was unheard of for two legislators to simultaneously claim to be the lawful head of a committee . At the heart of the dispute was the legislature 's secretariat , which is now under fire for possible illegality. <h> 1 : What is the extradition bill proposed by the Hong Kong government ? <p> In February , the Hong Kong government proposed amending laws so that the city can accept extradition requests from countries where there is no prior agreement . The new system would operate on a case-by-case basis , with the chief executive and local courts playing key roles in determining whether a request is approved . <p> However , the proposed law does not just apply to Taiwan , which Beijing does not recognise as an independent state . It will potentially apply to all other nations where Hong Kong lacks an extradition deal .

Lawmakers can choose to join such a committee , and they will then consider " the general merits and principles , and the detailed provisions , of the bill allocated to it ; and may also consider any amendments relevant to the bill . " <p> Photo : LegCo . <p> Before a bills committee starts working in earnest , it must first elect a chairperson and , if necessary , a vice-chairperson . Given that the pro-Beijing camp enjoys a majority in LegCo , the chairperson role usually falls to a pro-Beijing lawmaker and the vice-chair will be offered to democrats as a compromise . <p> But who calls the shots before a formal chairperson is elected ? That temporary leadership role is called a " presiding member , " which is reserved for the longest-serving lawmaker present . Once the election is complete , the presiding member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typically takes half an hour , which means it will usually be resolved in the committee 's initial meeting . <h> 3 : What were the events leading up to Monday 's controversial meeting ? <p> When the bills committee for the government 's extradition proposal first met on April 17 , the presiding member was James To from the Democratic Party . To was first elected to LegCo in 1991 and has held onto his seat ever since . <p> At the committee 's next meeting on April 30 , democrats repeated their stalling strategy and the chairperson 's seat remained unfilled . The pro-Beijing camp decided not to counter the filibuster head-on , instead opting to abstain from the meeting in a gesture of protest . <p> Hours after the second abortive meeting , pro-Beijing lawmakers said they would use the House Committee as the site for their counter-offensive , circumventing the bills committee altogether . <h> 4 : What is the House Committee and why is it important ? <p> As a body with wide-ranging responsibilities , the House Committee makes preparations for Council meetings and deals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also responsible for setting up bills committees . <p> The legislature 's House Committee meeting on Saturday .

" However , democrats have asserted that a bills committee has its own elected leadership and is not bound by what the House Committee decides . <p> On Saturday , the House Committee called an emergency meeting to deal with the legislative quagmire surrounding the extradition proposal . The meeting was chaired by DAB veteran Starry Lee , who went on to eject four pro-democracy lawmakers over protests during the meeting . <p> With a secure pro-Beijing majority , the House Committee voted 37-19 to issue a set of guidelines to the bills committee , stating that lawmaker Abraham Shek -- not To -- will take on the duties of presiding member until a formal chairperson is elected . <p> Abraham Shek .

At the Saturday meeting , one of the legal advisors for the Legislative Council said that it was up to the bills committee to decide how to interpret the guidelines . <p> Democrats could not block the guidelines from being issued , but since the guidelines would need to be discussed at the bills committee itself , it offered another hypothetical opportunity for stalling .

According to the Handbook for Chairmen of Bills Committees , only the chairperson can issue circulars , and no decision can be made by circular if any member expressed disapproval . <p> Civic Party leader Alvin Yeung called the secretariat 's move a " coup , " and To denounced the attempt to usurp his role as the presiding member . <p> The secretariat is led by the legislature 's secretary-general Kenneth Chen , who took up the role in 2012 after serving four years as the Undersecretary for Education . <p> Tasked with " providing efficient administrative , secretariat and research support for the Council , " the secretariat is comprised of 686 posts -- including secretaries , researchers , translators , legal advisors , security officers and public information officers . <p> On Monday , 23 pro-democracy lawmakers issued a legal letter to Chen accusing him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retract his decision , otherwise they may launch a legal action or report him to law enforcement agencies . <p> Democrats also tried unsuccessfully to confront Chen at his office . Civic Party lawmaker Dennis Kwok vowed to move a motion of no confidence against Chen at the next House Committee meeting . <p> In a statement on Monday evening , Chen said the situation was unprecedented . " The secretariat has always adhered to the principle of being impartial , and will continue to support the legislature in a professional , neutral way , " he wrote . " I deeply regret that some LegCo members have been repeatedly criticising the secretariat . " <p> Chen said he would not comment on the circular because of the democrats ' threat of legal action . <h> 7 : Who is in charge ?

@@42139238 <p> Due to the uncertainties brought by Sino-US trade frictions and the negative impacts caused by recent scandals of some Chinese companies , a secondary listing in Hong Kong becomes quite attractive to the China- based and US-listed issuers <h> Latest trends in cross-border bankruptcy between the mainland and Hong Kong <p> As the economic and trade exchanges between mainland China and Hong Kong have become more frequent , in recent years the number of issues that need to be resolved through cross-border cooperation in bankruptcy cases has also increased . Although the Arrangements for Mutual Recognition and Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Cases by Courts of the mainland and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region issued in January 2019 did not included bankruptcy ( winding-up ) cases , some cases occurred in recent years where the courts in the mainland and Hong Kong recognized each other 's bankruptcy ( winding-up ) procedures as well as the status of each other 's bankruptcy administrator ( liquidator ) . This new trend deserves the attention of cross-border investors . <p> Mainland 's attitude towards Hong Kong 's winding-up procedures . According to the interpretation of the Supreme People 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2011 , the " winding-up order " made by Hong Kong courts is not a " judgment or ruling of foreign courts " that can be recognized and enforced by courts in the mainland . <p> However , the Sino-Environment Technology Group Limited case concluded by the Supreme People 's Court in 2014 created the possibility for Hong Kong liquidators to represent liquidated companies in cases heard by mainland courts . <p> The plaintiff in this case was a Singaporean company that had entered the bankruptcy proceeding abroad . The Supreme People 's Court cited the provisions of article 14 of the Law on the Choice of Law Concerning Foreign-Related Civil Relations and held that the determination of the litigation status and related powers of the plaintiff 's foreign representative should be governed by the law of the plaintiff 's place of registration , i.e. , the law of Singapore . According to this ruling , courts of the mainland may apply the law of the place of registration , i.e. , the law of Hong Kong , to a Hong Kong company that has been wound up , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquidators in the cases heard by courts of the mainland , thereby enabling Hong Kong liquidators to represent liquidated companies to participate in the proceedings of courts in the mainland . <p> Hong Kong 's attitude towards mainland bankruptcy proceedings . As early as 2001 , Hong Kong courts had provided judicial assistance to the mainland 's bankruptcy proceedings according to common law rules . In the case of CCIC Finance Limited v Guangdong International Trust and Investment Corporation ( Guangxin ) and its Hong Kong subsidiary , Guangxin was declared bankrupt by the High People 's Court of Guangdong Province , and thus its liquidation group applied to the Hong Kong court for an order to stop all legal proceedings against Guangxin and its Hong Kong subsidiary . The Hong Kong court finally approved the application , making the case the first where the Hong Kong court approved the mainland 's bankruptcy liquidation procedure . <p> In the next decade or so , we have not seen the Hong Kong court make a judgment similar to the Guangxin case . However , since the beginning of 2020 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bankruptcy liquidation procedures in the CEFC case ( HCMP 2295/2019 ) and the Nianfu case ( HCMP 2295/2020 ) , and granted judicial assistance to the mainland administrators . This new trend has aroused widespread concern in practice . In the CEFC case , the High Court of Hong Kong admitted that CEFC Shanghai International Group Limited ( CEFC ) was in bankruptcy liquidation on the mainland , and suspended the lawsuit filed by creditors of CEFC in Hong Kong at the request of its administrator . The main reason was that the bankruptcy liquidation on the mainland was a collective liquidation procedure and therefore eligible to be recognized in Hong Kong . <p> In the Nianfu case , the High Court of Hong Kong , at the request of Shenzhen Intermediate Court , not only recognized the bankruptcy liquidation procedure Nianfu had undergone on the mainland , but also provided judicial assistance for its administrator to fully perform its duties in Hong Kong . The administrator was allowed to fully exercise the rights of Nianfu 's subsidiaries in Hong Kong on behalf of Nianfu . The successive appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judicial institutions of the mainland and Hong Kong have begun to explore closer cooperation in the field of bankruptcy . <p> Other forms of bankruptcy cooperation . In addition to the above cases , the mainland and Hong Kong have also explored other avenues of cooperation in the field of bankruptcy in recent years . For example , in the winding-up case of China Medical Technologies Inc in Hong Kong , the investigation and collection of evidence were conducted on the mainland . The administrator of Lo Siu Fai 's bankruptcy in Hong Kong , with the assistance of the autonomous organization of Shenzhen 's bankruptcy administrators , applied the bankruptcy estate disposal model of the Shenzhen court , and five bankruptcy properties including the special Hong Kong vehicle licence plate numbers were auctioned on the online platform Alibaba Auction . <p> The impact of new cross-border bankruptcy trends on cross-border investors .

Firstly , after the debtor enters bankruptcy proceedings in one place , the administrator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and debts , and suspend litigation involving the debtor , and may even include the affiliates of the debtor in another place in the consolidated bankruptcy . Secondly , since Hong Kong has established a relatively mature bankruptcy system for natural persons , with the gradual establishment of the bankruptcy system for natural persons on the mainland , after corporate debtors in one place go bankrupt , it may become possible that creditors can use the cross-border bankruptcy mechanism to recover debts from natural-person guarantors in another place . Thirdly , mutual cooperation in investigating and collecting evidence and selling the bankruptcy estate will make it more difficult for debtors to transfer and hide property across borders , and make the auction and sale of the bankruptcy estate more efficient and convenient . The above three situations will undoubtedly have a direct impact on the scope of the debtor 's estate and the creditor 's satisfaction rate . <p> To sum up , the cross-border cooperation between the mainland and Hong Kong in bankruptcy is a common reality between the two places and is expected to enter accelerated development in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that cross-border investors pay close attention to the relevant trends in this field .

@@42197230 <p> In her book " Lean In : Women , Work , and the Will to Lead " , Sheryl Sandberg exhorts women to devote themselves to work in order to shatter the glass ceiling . Sandberg , who was Chief of Staff to Larry Summers at the US Treasury , a Vice President at Google , and now Chief Operating Officer of Facebook , is also a mother of two . Sandberg asserts that , despite the gender biases in the workplace , a woman can juggle work and family as long as she is persistent and dedicated enough . Leaning in creates a cycle of success : if a woman acts to balance her work and family life , she will not edge herself out of plum assignments , she will succeed professionally , and as she rises up the ranks , she will have more bargaining power to ask for what she needs to accommodate her schedule as a mother . <p> Sheryl Sandberg .

Sandberg herself fulfils such criteria , but women like her are the exception , not the norm . Many working women can not afford to choose for whom , for how many hours , and under what circumstances they work . For example , many single mothers and less educated women struggle to find jobs with good career prospects ; some women have to work to support their spouse ; and domestic helpers may be too expensive . <p> Even for the women who manage to achieve great career success and have children , this does not necessarily mean that they spend sufficient quality time with them . In Hong Kong , where hiring domestic helpers is commonplace , many career-focused women rely heavily on domestic helpers to act as the primary carer at home . <p> Clearly , " leaning in " is not a solution for the vast majority of working women , and at most can only be part of the solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then , can women of all income and education levels combine their professional aspirations with a real commitment to ( and satisfaction with ) their families ? <p> First , there needs to be greater female representation on the top rungs of government , corporations and the judiciary . While this may sound like a circular argument , the " leadership gap " must be closed in order for women to be equally represented alongside men in both the private and public sectors . To achieve greater female representation , a combination of strategies should be implemented , such as alternative fee structures , telecommuting , and more flexible working hours . <p> If working women are to really " lean in " , that necessarily means that their male counterparts will have to take up more of the family-caring duties that are traditionally seen as the woman 's responsibility . If men are incentivized to take on more of what is traditionally considered " women 's work " , this can only be a good thing ; men , like women , have been restricted by sexist social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be given opportunities to contribute towards their families in ways other than merely being the " main breadwinner . " <p> In theory , one of the most direct methods to address the skewed male-female distribution of labour is paternal leave . If men have the option of taking leave before and after their wives give birth ( or after they adopt an infant ) , it could help the woman get back to work sooner , while allowing the man to spend more precious time with his newborn . However , in order for this to be effective , the leave period must be long enough to have an impact in the first place , and incentives need to be put in place to encourage families to take advantage of paternal leave . <p> Convention No. 183 , published by the International Labour Organization , calls for at least 14 weeks of paid leave for women , at least two-thirds cash benefits of previous earnings while on leave , and the benefits to be paid for by social insurance or public funds .

Furthermore , several countries such as Sweden , Germany and the UK adopt " parental leave " policies in which a bulk number of weeks are provided to a household , and the couple can decide how to allocate their time . Certain countries also provide incentives for men to take their leave days . For example , in Germany and Portugal , a mother gets bonus leave if the father takes a minimum amount of leave . In Sweden , parents are entitled to 480 days of paid parental leave , of which 60 days are reserved for fathers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother can not take advantage of those lost days . <p> The dated view of man as breadwinner and woman as homemaker is not an exclusively Chinese concept ; many cultures around the world have similar views ..

@@42197239 <p> The first Securities Law of the PRC come into effect on 1 July 1999 , and has since undergone five amendments . The latest revision came into effect on 1 March 2020 . It is more striking than all previous revisions , with many highlights . <h> Legal challenges in the internet age <p> Anna Xue is the IP director at the legal department of Perfect World . In today 's developed network economy , how counsel with internet companies address issues involving data privacy and copyright protection is of interest to all in-house counsel . Here she shares her views with China Business Law Journal . <h> CBLJ : Can you outline your early career experience ? <p> Xue : I have worked at state-owned , foreign-funded and private enterprises . They are very good companies , among which are time-honoured establishments , a company listed in Europe , and a Fortune 500 company . They have provided me with excellent growth platforms and resources at different stages -- I had the time of my life serving each of them . <p> For example , I was the head of a new department in a state-owned enterprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as start-ups did . This experience enabled me to take a more empathic approach to balancing the income pressure and compliance needs of business teams in my future career . <p> When working at a foreign-funded company , which is a time-honoured European enterprise with a history going back more than a century , I reported directly to the CEO . I had the opportunities to zoom in and fully experience the well-established compliance and governance culture of the company and its relevant systems . I was also able to work side by side with business teams for each order . <p> The work experience at the global Fortune 500 company was uniquely different . The huge business size brought unexpected complexity to compliance programmes and risk controls , providing me with opportunities to further strengthen my project execution and management capabilities . <h> CBLJ : What can you tell us about your experience in translating data privacy laws across jurisdictions , and what can outbound Chinese companies learn from these laws ? <p> Xue : I have participated in the translation of legislation , cases and literature on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe , Brazil , India and Japan . Generally , there are two views that I would like to share . First , the perception that personal data protection should be valued in the digital economy era has become a widely accepted value . Second , countries are fighting increasingly fiercely for legislative power in the online world . <p> For Chinese internet companies , meeting data privacy regulatory requirements of target markets is a new challenge and proposition that can not be circumvented in their " going global " process . The effectiveness of the EU General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ) has driven many Chinese internet companies to " open a window " , whether actively or passively , and get informed about data privacy regulation in foreign jurisdictions . <p> However , we need to further " open up our gateway " to learn more about legislation and enforcement in foreign jurisdictions , and ensure success of our going global process by incorporating the concept of data privacy compliance into the design of products and services . After all , data privacy compliance risk can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business at any time . <h> CBLJ : In this era of heightened data regulation , what challenges do in-house counsel at internet companies face , and how do they deal with them ? <p> Xue:What I say is my personal opinion only , and is not the opinion of my employer . Except for general challenges relating to regulation in the IP intellectual property and TMT technology , media and telecoms sectors , in-house counsel at internet companies also face challenges from data privacy protection , which is a new field of heightened regulation . <p> This field involves legal compliance issues that an in-house counsel at an internet company faces almost in the entire process of his or her routine work . What should the user-end online protocol look like ? How should product models be designed to ensure privacy protection ? How should user rights requirements at back office be met ? How are employee data collected and managed ? How is the data transmission risk of the entire supply chain controlled ? From the perspective of corporate governance , how is the accountability system for data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ era of heightened data regulation , in-house counsel at internet companies face some new challenges . From my personal experience I believe that , against this backdrop , in-house counsel can improve their work by taking the following three steps : <p> First , we should be well familiar with the regulatory requirements of local jurisdictions and keep informed about foreign laws . As a rising star in the field of data regulation , China has legislation that is vague and changing rapidly , and it assigns legislative and enforcement work to a relatively dispersed collection of bodies . Given these facts , it is a big challenge for in-house counsel to truly understand the crucial regulatory objectives and make sure that iterative updates of products meet regulatory requirements at any time . <p> Second , compared with constant attention to legal provisions , performing specific work concerning data privacy requires in-house counsel to pay more attention to what real data mapping looks like , and have the ability to translate machine-readable data to legal texts understandable by human beings -- which puts an in-house counsel 's level of understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in-house counsel , coping with this test is not so easy . But it is precisely these challenges and innovations that compel us to talk in different languages with teams of diversified backgrounds , thereby enabling us to grow quickly . <p> Third , compared with some conventional in-house counsel , we need to put ourselves more in specific scenarios to feel what users ' privacy and security experience is like in those scenarios . All our advice on data privacy compliance naturally reflects the logic of a product manager . How should every sentence be written , and when should a pop-up window appear ? These details do not only have a great impact on the smooth use of products by users , but also affect user perceptions about the risk of their privacy being compromised . Therefore , performing in-house counselling duties require us to stand in the shoes of product managers . This can be a challenge for lawyers in this field . But where there is a challenge , there is also fun . <h> CBLJ : What capabilities do IP-related in-house counsel in the entertainment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The entertainment industry is an IP-intensive sector . Generally speaking , a company in this sector has an IP asset base comprising three categories of IP , the first being copyrights , which account for the largest percentage , the second being trademarks , and the third being patents and trade secrets . <p> The toughest professional challenges that I have met involve ambiguities and uncertainties surrounding copyright systems in this internet age . The approaches to presenting products , the granularity at which copyrights are dividable , and the manners in which copyrights can be licensed and used have become very difficult to observe . And there are even propositions that are unknown to judges . In-house counsel must be able to describe unprecedented businesses , products or service models with existing words and expressions about copyrights . <p> This is what conventional legal professionals call the ability to " subsume " between facts and legal texts . The more precise , conventional and stable a fact is , the easier it is to subsume . But legislation naturally lags behind facts , which are constantly changing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a challenge that in-house counsel in the entertainment industry must tackle in the internet era . <p> Using hysteretic legislation to deal with ever-changing products does put an in-house counsel 's capabilities to the test -- apart from the ability to understand products , we must also prove that we have solid legal expertise . Fields with more innovations and ambiguities pose proportionately tougher challenges for in-house counsel to prove their basic capabilities . As a matter of fact , professionals working at the frontiers must have well-founded expertise . <h> CBLJ : What roles do external law firms play in your work , and what standards do you use to select these firms ? <p> Xue : External lawyers play an indispensable role in an in-house counsel 's work process because they provide both a professional resource and external support . Lucky for me , having worked with well-known law firms at home and abroad on many complex major projects , I have gained valuable expertise and experience from many external lawyers . But generally speaking , it 's not easy to find partnering external lawyers who are acceptable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing so within budgets . <p> When selecting external lawyers , I generally consider two categories of factors , one being basic factors and the other being " plus " factors . <p> The basic factors relate to fundamental capabilities of external lawyers : they must have deep expertise in their own fields of practice and be really better skilled than in-house counsel in legal search , precedent and statutory interpretation , legal analysis , and text drafting . Otherwise , I ca n't see why there is a need to hire external lawyers for mandates . <p> The " plus " factors involve a comprehensive assessment process that measures with more diversified standards . Specifically , external lawyers must : ( 1 ) be able to fully and accurately identify and understand the problems that in-house counsel need to solve ; ( 2 ) leverage on their extensive industry and practice experience to co-ordinate in the interpretation of regulatory requirements and industry practices ; ( 3 ) be able to grasp the essence quickly , and act with extraordinary responsiveness and flexibility , when working on projects of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 4 ) be able to assist in-house counsel to manage projects effectively where they involve teams of multiple parties . <p> They must also keep effective communication with in-house counsel , respond timely and effectively , and always work carefully , as these details also affect the " user experience " of in-house counsel on working with external lawyers . <p> When an excellent in-house counsel works together with an outstanding external lawyer , it is actually a process of driving mutual improvement and achievement . Each time after the two parties complete a challenging project with joint effect , they feel a sense of accomplishment that only legal professionals can understand . <p> The first Securities Law of the PRC come into effect on 1 July 1999 , and has since undergone five amendments .

@@42225239 <p> Over a century ago , before the arrival of the British , rural Hong Kong was linguistically diverse . Some inhabitants spoke Hakka , fishermen living on boats communicated using their own Tanka dialects , while Yuen Long , Sha Tin and Tai Po spoke different variations of Waitau Wa -- village Cantonese . <p> But when conservationist Chloe Lai set out for South Lantau to film a documentary about elderly Waitau Wa speakers in Shui Hau village , she became captivated by their " mountain songs , " which -- if not preserved -- may vanish within a generation . <p> Shui Hau village . Photo : Rhymes of Shui Hau trailer screenshot . <p> Among the villages dotted along South Lantau Road , Shui Hau village is relatively small , with a population of only several hundred . Its picturesque beach is popular with clam-diggers across Hong Kong . <p> Lai -- better known as an urban researcher -- told HKFP that she was introduced to Shui Hau after her friends from the University of Hong Kong conducted a biodiversity project in the area , and decided to extend her conservation efforts to the rural village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three elderly village women speaking Waitau Wa . <p> The oldest of the women is over 90 , and is not an indigenous Shui Hau villager .

Shui Hau villagers took part in building what was Hong Kong 's largest reservoir back in 1961 , and their neighbours were relocated to an urban estate in Tsuen Wan . <p> Anthropological clues <p> Through assistance from the children and grandchildren of the women , Lai and her team began transcribing their " mountain songs " -- popular Waitau Wa rhymes that they learnt to sing in their youth .

Photo : Urban Diary via Facebook . <p> Lai said that some songs included descriptions of birds that only appeared in Shui Hau village in certain months of the year given their migration patterns : " This is something very geographically-specific . " <p> When screening her completed documentary for the first time , Lai also met a villager from North Lantau 's Tung Chung , who cited his local elders as saying that their own mountain songs were adapted from those of Shui Hau . <p> " I was very surprised to hear this , and I wanted to know how we could find out more in the future .

" <p> At present , Lai has only organised screenings of her documentary for visitors to Shui Hau village itself .

In addition to the cost equation , there are other significant drivers of change impacting upon the legal profession . <p> As a major development , the recently passed Legal Services Act , 2007 , in the UK , which received Royal assent in 2007 , has been understood to impact the legal process outsourcing industry in a dramatic way . <h> Alternative structures <p> The Clementi Report on the regulation of the legal profession , together with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the passing of the Legal Services Act , 2007 . <p> One of the major features of the act refers to alternative business structures ( ABS ) , which enable consumers to obtain services from one business entity that brings lawyers and non-lawyers together . <p> As an explanatory note from the House of Lords on this aspect of the act states : " These ABS will allow lawyers and non-lawyers to work together on an equal footing to deliver legal and other services .

@@42259235 <h> A shrill discord <p> Indian lawyers are fighting a rear-guard battle against globalization , argues prominent commentator and former regional editor of the Far Eastern Economic Review , VG Kulkarni <p> Looking back at independent India 's history , one can not but notice that changes in policy came quite easily in the first three of the six decades -- despite the daunting challenges of nation-building . Several sectors of the economy came under state control one by one , as existing industries were nationalized or new ones were created by successive governments . There was not much public outcry against these measures . After all , many of the industries belonged to the erstwhile colonial masters and local tycoons who -- with a few significant exceptions -- had played no role in the independence movement . <p> VG KulkarniFormer regional editorFar Eastern Economic Review <p> By the early 1990s , a foreign exchange crisis caused by the first Gulf War almost resulted in India becoming a debt defaulter and forced the adoption of market reforms . Every step in converting a protected economy to an open one has been hard fought , because a closed system of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for vested interests . And politicians loved to put on the nationalist robes in the name of populism . <p> Despite the march of globalization , agreements with the World Trade Organization and India 's growing engagement with the world economy , protectionist sentiment -- partly justified , partly not -- continues to have a following in the country . In such a climate arose over the past couple of years a shrill debate and discord over the moves to open up India 's legal market to foreign law firms . <p> Early in the game , the Bar Council of India , the nation 's premier body regulating the profession , fired the initial salvo along the expected nationalist , protectionist lines that entry of foreign lawyers would affect the system of delivering justice itself . Even the unlikely spectre of the entry of foreign judges in the court system was raised . <p> By now the Indian legal lobbies should realize that they are fighting a rear-guard battle against the march of globalization . Unlike the drawn out controversies over foreign participation in special economic zones , retail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of millions people , the tangle of the legal eagles involves only a few thousand elite lawyers . ( The legions of country lawyers in district courts and small towns have no role in corporate law or cross-border transactions . ) <p> But even a few thousand lawyers and their domestic client companies need to be given a fair deal that would benefit most of those affected and boost economic growth . It is all but clear that the legal market will open sooner or later , so the demand that a level playing field should be created has gained momentum . <p> If India 's law and commerce ministries try to rush things , the lawyers can always call upon the anti-globalization opposition parties to raise yet another hue and cry ; the communists and other leftist opposition parties are full of trained lawyers , anyway . In any case , several provincial elections are due in the coming months and by the year-end the whole country will be gearing up for general elections . There is hardly any chance of a shaky coalition regime wanting to take on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mumbai . <p> That said , the Indian law and commerce ministries should be willing and able to consider and concede some of the reasonable demands of the domestic legal profession . Having arrived at a consensus that liberalization is necessary , nay inevitable , it would not be difficult to design an orderly and phased transition to allow local law firms to get used to the coming changes . <p> The rules governing the legal profession need to be overhauled . Any restriction placed on local lawyers should also apply to foreigners . The Advocates Act that restricts lawyers from advertising and other self-promotion can be suitably amended . Other issues such as allowing limited law partnerships and the applicable tax treatment to local firms are easy to accomplish .

@@42333230 <h> After the vaccine <p> There is a growing consensus that one or more COVID-19 vaccines will become available at some point in early 2021 . Within a year , many people in the United States , and some other countries , will be vaccinated . For some childhood diseases , the development of a vaccine was by itself decisive . But this may not be true of COVID-19 , because adoption could be slow or effectiveness wane over time -- or both . <p> In that case , the need to test people both for individual safety and to prevent outbreaks will be ongoing . The long-term problem with testing is already evident : the cost per test is high . In health-care systems where scare medical resources are allocated on a fee-for-service basis , such as in the US , this means that many people can not afford to get tested . In addition to progress toward a vaccine , we need to make virus testing at scale much cheaper , so that it becomes available to everyone , whatever their income level . <p> Currently , the untested in the US include most children attending public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and others who work in those schools . They also include millions of older people , including those living in low-income housing ( known as Section 202 housing ) . This lack of access to testing is a major economic and moral issue that will not go away . <p> The economic problem is centered around schools . If families and teachers are worried about what happens when children go to school , it is hard to get the economy -- including jobs and incomes -- back on track . Education disparities , which are already stark , will continue to widen . Some children will never attain the reading and math skills they are missing now . This will likely lower their lifetime incomes . <p> There are roughly 57 million children in primary and secondary schools in the US , living in 34 million households ( of which nearly 24 million have two parents and ten million have one ) . There are close to four million teachers and more than one million childcare workers . The continuing failure to provide virus testing in schools thus directly affects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine becomes widely available , schools are likely to require children to be vaccinated . But there may be exemptions for religious or health reasons , as there is now for other vaccines . Health information is confidential , so you do not know who around you has had which vaccines . Tests for live virus are now non-intrusive ( saliva or nasal swab ) and can provide considerable reassurance -- as well as the ability to detect and stop outbreaks . <p> Owing to a legacy of official neglect and inaction , 40% of the COVID-related deaths in the US so far have occurred in long-term care facilities , where many residents are seriously ill and most are over the age of 60 . Now , these facilities have more infection-control resources , testing is available , and the discussion is shifting toward preventing anything like this from happening again . <p> But we must not forget other vulnerable people , including in minority communities and those living in " congregate " facilities such as apartment buildings . Many elderly people have been in some form of self-imposed isolation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By all accounts , the resulting isolation and loneliness is taking an awful toll , including by accelerating aging and potentially pushing more people toward dementia . <p> New testing technology , including disposable at-home kits , could become part of the solution . There are still questions about how precise these tests will be -- how many false negatives and false positives we should expect -- when deployed at massive scale . But the main question is how long it will take to establish and run the supply chains necessary to support production and distribution of hundreds of millions of such tests per month . <p> The other promising development is pooled testing . COVID-19 lab tests typically cost between $25 and $125 , depending on the regional market . But the numbers look very different if you build the costs from the bottom up : a couple of dollars for the tube ( with or without a swab ) to collect samples , a small amount for the logistics of specimen collection at scale ( mostly shipping ) , and whatever it costs to operate the relevant information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporting requirements ) . Pooling ten or 20 samples in one tube can lower the costs significantly , because it economizes on the expensive reagents needed to run the lab tests . <p> What do we need to get the cost per person tested down to $5 or even lower ? In a single word : competition . As more labs figure out and offer pooled testing , prices will fall . For once , capitalism and market competition can help the people most in need of help .

Delivering messages and offers that resonate with an individual 's unique needs and expectations requires deep insights . <p> As such , marketers are adopting new digital channels .

@@42430236 <h> Newsletters <h> Newsletters <p> One of the most appealing things about a pop-up restaurant event is its exclusivity , and reservations at 888 Fatfatfat -- which will only be around for another month -- have already been difficult to secure . Diners are hungry to try out the not-so-secret restaurant hidden inside the Shanghai Garden Chinese restaurant in Exchange Square , which is not an extension of its host -- instead , it is a distinctive space with a completely different menu , vibe , and concept altogether . Here are eight more reasons why 888 Fatfatfat is an irresistible experience not to be missed . <h> The Concept <p> Photo : Courtesy of 888 Fatfatfat <p> The 888 Fatfatfat restaurant pop-up has one mission , which is to create a dining experience that goes beyond serving good food and drinks , and it does so with a strong story . The concept plays on the Chinese myth of the Eight Immortals , and their magical realm of abundance where rice bowls and wine vessels are always full , signifying good fortune everywhere they go -- it 's an idea that is cleverly iterated in details such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call for more alcohol . <h> Story continues below <p> A large part of the appeal of 888 Fatfatfat lies in its speakeasy format . Guests must enter through Shanghai Garden , passing tables of diners , to reach a hidden entrance out back -- a sliding wall reveals a space that looks and feels completely different from the restaurant . Although the restaurant has already been widely documented on social media , the suspense and intrigue that builds as you slowly approach the big reveal is still worthwhile . <h> The Interior <p> Photo : Courtesy of 888 Fatfatfat <p> Formerly a windowless room inside Shanghai Garden , the semi-private space has been transformed with an abundance of white and gold , from bunches of pale straw that seem to sashay across the walls to the mythical tree installations weaved throughout the long , winding dinner table . Low lighting and details such as brushed gold table lamps and ceramic chopsticks exude comfort and a sense of luxury throughout . <h> The Drinks <p> Photo : Courtesy of 888 Fatfatfat <p> Begin the meal with cocktails from a menu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The drinks feature key ingredients found in Chinese cuisine such as baijiu , goji berries , jasmine tea , red jujubes , and Shaoxing wine . Guests can also opt for cocktails designed for sharing , or a free-flow wine option . A baijiu tasting flight is also available for the brave . <h> The Drinking Games <p> Photo : Courtesy of 888 Fatfatfat <p> One of the highlights of 888 Fatfatfat is their penchant for showcasing Chinese culture and humour . Tables are given drinking games and trivia to pass the time between courses -- one being a set of fortune sticks , where guests pick out a random ' fortune ' to test their knowledge on traditional idioms and food-related puns . <h> Regional Chinese Dishes <p> Photo : Courtesy of 888 Fatfatfat <p> The menu offerings at the 888 Fatfatfat pop-up is well thought-out , and are dishes which are carefully curated to represent different regional cuisines of China , from Cantonese 's steamed giant razor clams with black garlic and vermicelli to Sichuan braised angus beef with chilli oil broth ; The eight Immortals ' fried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bird , carved into eight portions and deep-fried until golden brown , require skills for fine execution . The traditional deep-fried chicken originated in Henan province and was documented in Chinese culinary volumes over two centuries ago . The deceptively simple fried chicken requires the expertise of the master chef , from sourcing the right sized chicken , skilled carving and expert control of oil temperature and heat distribution to yield the perfect crust and juicy flesh in the chicken . <h> Plant-Based Dishes <p> Photo : Courtesy of 888 Fatfatfat <p> Thanks to Grassroots Initiatives ' Peggy Chan , the plant-based sharing plates are some of the pop-up 's best-selling offerings , showing how meat and seafood Chinese classics can be successfully reimagined into plant-based dishes . Their Peking ' duck ' wraps are made with cured jackfruit and crispy tofu skin , while the Xinjiang ' lamb ' are made with cumin-rubbed lion 's mane mushrooms skewered with konnyaku morsels . The most popular dish of typhoon shelter-style ' squid ' is actually made with carved wedges of coconut flesh , served with dried chillies and garlic crumbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fatfatfat <p> Gone are the kitschy contemporary tunes of elevator music or tacky synthesized pop-tunes , 888 Fatfatfat 's eclectic playlist of urban beats and hip hop tracks featuring local sensation LMF as well as Taiwanese artists such as Miss Ko , Leo Wang , and Soft Lipa are played throughout the dining experience . The key is to encourage guests to wind down over good food , drinks and fun , something we greatly need in 2021 , and the creators of 888 Fatfatfat knows this -- and delivers it way past the finish line . <p> 888 Fatfatfat runs from now until end of November 2020 .

Not only is support for Hong Kong deeply bipartisan , but the President-elect has made it clear that it will remain tough on China while prioritising regional alliances and partnerships to counter the Chinese government 's aggression and overreach . American support for Hong Kong is here to stay . <h> How Hong Kong won American support <p> While the Trump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president 's record on the subject is mixed . During the 2014 Umbrella Movement , he wrote that then-President Obama should " stay out of the Hong Kong protests " -- a philosophy which he continued to hold during his own presidency . <p> Not to be deterred , the Hong Kong people brilliantly earned global media attention by crowdfunding ads and through international grassroots mobilisation . The global diaspora staged sympathy protests around the world . And when Hongkongers marched with US flags and sang the US national anthem , Americans felt proud that for all their nation 's faults , it remained the global symbol of freedom and democracy . <p> Despite Trump 's ambivalence , Hong Kongers won the support of the American people and of Congress , which collectively forced the Trump administration to change its tune . A reluctant Trump was forced to sign the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act into law . <h> The Covid effect <p> Covid-19 changed how President Trump viewed China . He initially praised Chinese efforts to contain the virus , even writing that Xi Jinping was " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counterattack on the coronavirus . " But when the virus began killing thousands of Americans and Chinese Foreign Minister spokesman Zhao Lijian blamed its origin on American soldiers , Trump 's political calculations favoured a tougher China policy . He quickly pivoted to blaming China for the virus , and the " tough on China " strategy was born . <p> Once the administration 's hawks found their wings , Secretary of State Mike Pompeo quickly began recruiting other nations to the cause . Fortunately , there were many eager to join the new strategy , thanks to several own-goals by Chinese diplomats and its " wolf warriors , " who decided to simultaneously threaten Canada , Australia , India , the Czech Republic , the United Kingdom and Taiwan , amongst others . <p> Photo : GovHK . <p> These and countless other diplomatic faux pas , along with ham-fisted propaganda that accompanied the coronavirus , contributed to record-high unfavourable views of China around the world and bolsteredcommitment to the " Quad " alliance and closer military ties with the US . <p> With Congress and the President aligned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as the National Security Law was imposed on Hong Kong , the Hong Kong Autonomy Act became law at breakneck speed . It took less than two weeks from introduction to enactment , compared with five months for the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act . <h> Bipartisan support <p> While Republicans have certainly been the most vocal , US support for Hong Kong , Uyghurs , Taiwan , and countering Chinese aggression and coercion around the world has been unequivocally bipartisan : a feat which is extremely rare in American politics . <p> Scott Kennedy of CSIS recently revealed that legislators from both parties sponsor supportive legislation in nearly equal amounts . While Republican Senator Marco Rubio introduced the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act , Vice President-elect Kamala Harris co-sponsored it along with the majority of their Senate colleagues . The Democrats ' leading voice in Congress , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , was a tireless advocate for its passage and met activists such as Joshua Wong and Nathan Law at the US Capitol . <p> Pelosi has been a thorn in Beijing 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she fought to protect the 40,000 Chinese students in the US at the time from the " butchers of Beijing . " And on a trip to Beijing in 1991 , she unfurled a banner in Tiananmen Square that read " to those who died for democracy in China . " Similarly , Republican Senators Rick Scott and Ted Cruz flew to Hong Kong in 2019 to join the protests and meet activists . <h> What to expect from a Biden presidency <p> The consensus is that American policy towards China will not change significantly under President-elect Biden . This is n't to say Biden 's past is beyond reproach on the issue , but the dynamic has changed significantly in recent years , and the US stance on China has changed accordingly . <p> Indeed , Biden 's views have evolved significantly since he was Vice President . It 's not just Trump who has woken up to the threat China poses to America 's friends in the Pacific : it 's the American people and US Government as a whole . <p> In a recent op-ed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get tough with China . " He has repeatedlycalled Xi Jinping a " thug " and slammed his actions in Hong Kong and Xinjiang . The Biden campaign has declared China 's treatment of Uyghurs " genocide " and its website says that " Joe will speak out against the internment camps in Xinjiang and hold the people and companies complicit in this appalling oppression accountable . " <p> The Wall Street Journal wrote that " the US has turned a corner in its relations with China and is likely to maintain a harder line . " The Washington Post reported that Chinese experts believe that a Biden administration would be more dangerous for China because " Biden will work with allies to target China , " and Biden might resort to more sophisticated and coordinated tactics against China . Axios agrees , claiming that Biden will " confront China across the globe " with the support of US allies . <p> Kurt Campbell , the top Asia official in President Obama 's State Department , believes that " there is a broad recognition in the Democratic Party that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but that a Biden administration would respond more effectively . In this sense , Biden and Trump differ only in their tactics , not their outlook . There will not be a sharp change of course under Biden 's administration . <h> Looking ahead <p> The United States is an extremely divided country , with few issues that unite both Democrats and Republicans . But Americans and their political leaders are united in their concern about an increasingly aggressive and authoritarian China . The Biden administration will continue pushing back against Beijing and standing up for Hongkongers , Uyghurs and Taiwan . <p> While the Trump administration must be given credit for helping to raise the issue , support for our friends in Asia is not coming to an end , and Biden 's consistent foreign policy and strong focus on supporting allies and partners is likely to be a more effective approach . <p> Supporters in Sweden . File photo : via Fridays for Freedom . <p> The fight against the Chinese Communist Party and its inhumane tactics is likely to span decades and many presidential terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the cause be acknowledged as bipartisan and that unity is able to grow and flourish . <p> Hong Kong protesters talk about not " cutting the mat " -- an expression that calls for unity amidst political or ideological divisions .

@@42491239 <h> A good but incomplete start to debt relief <p> A global collapse in economic activity during the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased the risk of debt distress in many countries , pushing the poorest ones to the brink . In response , various international organizations have unveiled a number of initiatives to forestall circumstances necessitating between responding adequately to the public-health crisis and servicing existing debts . <p> Most notably , the G20 has established a Debt Service Suspension Initiative ( DSSI ) , that allows the world 's poorest countries to suspend official bilateral debt-service payments until next year . And this month , G20 leaders adopted a new common framework to address sovereign-debt restructuring needs on a case-by-case basis . <p> For poorer countries grappling with the pandemic , debt not only limits their fiscal space for responding to the crisis but also forecloses on future development . Faced with the sudden costs of the COVID-19 crisis , many countries that are already struggling to service existing debt have needed fresh financing , only to find that it is too difficult or expensive to borrow more . And even if they can manage to do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , limiting their prospects for growth and development . <p> Far from involving a few unfortunate countries on the margins , today 's sovereign-debt distress poses a potentially systemic risk . Since 2014 , total sovereign debt as a share of GDP has not only risen substantially ; it has also become more fragmented , owing to the use of more diverse debt instruments among a wider range of creditors . <p> Given these circumstances , the global financial safety net urgently needs to be broadened beyond the support currently offered by international financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank . To that end , the DSSI took the first step by suspending principal and interest payments on debt falling due between May 1 , 2020 , and June 30 , 2021 ( having been extended from December 31 , 2020 ) , thereby expanding the safety net for at least 77 developing countries . <p> But while the DSSI offers some respite , it also merely kicks the debt-repayment can down the road , leaving the deferred payments to be repaid in full between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make up the difference with larger repayments , and might even need to borrow more to service their frozen debt , in addition to any other debt taken on during the COVID-19 crisis . The 46 countries that have applied for debt suspension so far eventually will have to cover $5.3 billion of postponed payments , on top of $71.54 billion of pre-existing commitments ; and any other debt contracted since the COVID-19 outbreak will be added to the burden . <p> Although the G20 's latest debt initiative misses the mark on many counts ( particularly when it comes to addressing the asymmetries between debtors and creditors ) , it has at least put a common framework for debt reductions squarely on the international agenda . The new initiative has two distinct merits . First , by allowing for a case-by-case approach , it addresses a specific concern raised by private-sector creditors , a key constituency that was not included in the DSSI . <p> Second , the new framework brings China on board , having overcome some initial resistance stemming from the definition of a state-owned bank ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Export-Import Bank would themselves be exposed to debt restructuring ) . Because China holds about 63% of overall debt owed to G20 member states , its participation is critical for the initiative 's success . <p> The common framework is an important first step in the right direction . But the G20 can not stop there ; the initiative needs to be expanded into a common scheme for sovereign-debt restructuring . Sovereign debt is the only debt class without a bankruptcy mechanism . While individuals and companies can declare bankruptcy , a country can not . <p> So far , the international community has relied on a contractual approach to prevent and resolve sovereign-debt problems . But this method often involves deep asymmetries between the treatment of debtors and creditors , resulting in an inequitable distribution of losses among different types of creditors . We need a multilateral agency specifically tasked with coordinating creditors , sharing information , and reducing the scope for information arbitrage . <p> In addition , the new framework should assist debtor countries throughout the restructuring process . For example , as the IMF has already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providing limited financing in order to give debtors some negotiating space to secure a sustainable debt-restructuring deal . <p> To tie everything together , the G20 should draw on its Operational Guidelines for Sustainable Financing to promote responsible lending and borrowing alongside orderly , multilateral debt restructuring . It should also support debt transparency and provide the necessary technical assistance , so that countries can strengthen their debt management capacity before finding themselves in debt distress . <p> Clear procedures , transparency , oversight , and accountability for managing sovereign debt are broad public goods . All people deserve to be fully informed about the steps their respective countries undertake when they borrow internationally , just as they should be aware of their countries ' debt obligations and liabilities . A framework that clarifies each step in the process of incurring a debt -- including the necessary checks and balances -- is critical for ensuring responsible borrowing ( and lending ) more generally .
