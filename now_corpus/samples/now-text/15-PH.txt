From the list of those who filed their certificates of candidacy , even if pruned downed to remove the deranged and weird aspirants , the main task left to the electorate now is still to at least ensure that the candidates who will win are not crooks and plunderers based on their past record of service both in the public and/or private sectors . <p> The electorate can fulfill this main task only if we have honest , orderly and peaceful elections ( HOPE ) . But under existing election laws and with the kind of electoral methods and practices in place , several obstacles exist stifling and dimming that HOPE . <p> Foremost of these obstacles are the political dynasties . Political dynasty exists when members of the same family by consanguinity or affinity , occupy or succeed to the same or several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every election we had in the past , more and more husbands and wives , fathers or mothers and sons and daughters , as well as brothers and sisters occupy or succeed as governors , mayors , vice governors , vice mayors , board members and councilors in most of the towns , cities and provinces all over the Philippines , including some cities in Metro Manila . Even in the Lower and Upper Houses of Congress , political dynasties are slowly gaining a firm foothold and increasing steadily . <p> It is now quite clear and obvious that political dynasties have not only deprived others of equal access to opportunities for public service . They have also seriously undermined the process of finding out the true voice of the people ( vox populi ) as expressed in the ballot . Families in power see to it that they remain in power by ensuring that their constituents remain poor and entirely dependent on them through dole outs and thus forever grateful to them come election time . <p> Actually however , the proliferation of political dynasties is not only inimical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also detrimental to good governance . When elected family members assume office , matters of public interest are usually discussed and decided in the privacy of their bedrooms or dining tables . And so the principle of checks and balances and transparency in governance are thrown out of the window . <p> But most detrimental is that political dynasties breed and perpetuate corruption in government . Members of the same family holding public offices and wielding political power will not wash their dirty linen in public . The natural tendency is for them to help each other in covering up shenanigans and other money-making government transactions they are involved in . They close ranks when implicated in order to protect their firm foothold and solidify their political power so that they can continue to cover up their involvement in government anomalies . <p> Opinion ( Article MRec ) , pagematch : 1 , sectionmatch : 1 <p> Another obstacle to fraud free and clean elections is the so called " command votes " coming from certain religious sects which binds and subjects their members ' right of suffrage allegedly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a more massive scale coming from specific areas all over the country where the voters choose their candidates dictated by influential and powerful personalities in their area . Thus we have the " solid north " , the Bicol or Visayan bloc " , and the " Mindanao votes . " Lately we also have the command votes supposedly delivered by local officials all over the country comprising the main cog of the well-oiled political parties financially backed up by business oligarchs . As shown in past elections , these supposed " votes " explain the dagdag bawas scheme that some candidates used to win elections . <p> Also an obstacle to a free , clean , honest and orderly election is the allegedly scientific " poll surveys " periodically conducted to find out who are leading or lagging behind in the race for a specific national position especially the presidency and the senatorial seats . Accurate or not , these poll surveys also undermine the process of finding out the real , honest to goodness choice of the voters as to the candidates who will promote their interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past elections , voters sometimes opt for candidates whom the surveys reveal as leading in the polls , believing rightly or wrongly that the candidates whom they prefer would lose anyway . This kind of " bandwagon effect " somehow makes " win-ability " as one of the qualifications in choosing a candidate and thus affects the electorate 's " intelligent vote " especially considering that the surveys are not completely reliable and credible . In fact , there are candidates " leading " in surveys that eventually lose and thus claim that they were cheated by the candidates " losing " in the surveys who eventually won in the election . <p> Then of course , another obstacle to an honest to goodness election is what is known as the " celebrity politics . " In this country , this kind of politics thrives well and has significantly grown because majority of our voters come from the C , D and E sectors who are enthralled by personalities they often see on TV , movies and newspapers especially sports heroes and movie stars . Hence when these personalities decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these voters is : " Iboboto ko yan " without finding out anymore whether they are the most qualified and best fitted for the position . To these voters , anyone lionized by media is magaling and their " idol . " Moreover , inside the polling booth during crunch time when they encounter hardship in filling up the ballots , the names that immediately come to mind are of course their " idols . " This " name recall " is another unfortunate reality in our elections that has adversely affected the wisdom and intelligence of the peoples ' choice . It has even impeded unknown but better qualified and well meaning citizens to seek public office . <p> And so HOPE will not spring and bloom in this country because of political dynasties , swing votes , poll surveys and celebrity politics . Let us get rid of them first .

@@2106230 <h> Winter Fashion Tips : Style Up From Head to Toe ! <p> Winter is almost at the door and so it is about time we open up our wardrobes and see what we have got for this season . If you see tacky stuff , or clothes you outgrew , there are two ways to deal with those ; giving those to younger siblings , who , not realizing that they have been given all the outdated clothes , would love you for it ! Or , the more preferable way would be to give those to the homeless people on your colony . <p> Either way , you need to make space in your wardrobe to fill it with the outfits that are ' in ' this winter . Beginning from the top , latest trends for the most important outfit for this season , that is pullovers , must be checked out . In contrast with summer when we prefer wearing kurtis or kameez that fit us perfectly , fashion statements in winter are different and instead oversized sweaters go very well this season . Whether it be mono colored or filled with vibrant fish scales or totem patterns , hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These may be either high or round collared but make sure you give your hairs a turtleneck look . Men may also refrain themselves from wearing hooded cardigans all throughout the winter and rather go for patterned sweaters for a change this year , but they of course need not look for the oversized ones ! <p> Next , to fight the chills better and also to look more stylish , you can complement your sweater with a long scarf . From fashion ignorants to fashion lovers , almost everyone prefer wearing a scarf around their neck ; and why not that be when so many scarf styles are out there , making this accessory an instant way to turn a simple outfit into a more stylish one ? <p> I do n't feel that there is any specific trend for choosing scarves because it has a variety of types , ranging from fur or woolen to tube shaped ones .

While skinny jeans and checkered leggings are going to be ' in ' this winter as always , picking up leather pants instead would surely make you look bold and different . These are usually found in black , but black goes well with every color on earth , does n't it ? <p> Finally , talking about footwear , with the skinny pants and oversized hip length sweaters , knee length boots would be the first choice for any fashionista .

Domingo Regional Trial Court Branch 37 that Ma . Cristina Sergio , live-in partner of her " kinakapatid " ( godbrother ) Julius Lacanilao , repeatedly attempted to recruit her to work abroad , once in 2012 and twice in 2014 . Sergio told her that working as manicurist or pedicurist outside the country would bring in money . <p> When asked how she responded to these offers , Valino said she reiterated that she was not yet of age and that she could not leave behind her now two-year-old son . <p> Valino 's large-scale , syndicated illegal recruitment complaint , along with other complainants , served as basis for the warrant of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Veloso , a Filipina on death row in Indonesia , said recruited her . <p> Mary Jane was sentenced to death in Indonesia more than five years ago for allegedly carrying 2.6 kilograms of heroin . Her scheduled execution was stayed at dawn of April 30 due to strong public outcry that she was a victim of human trafficking and , in the first place , should not have been charged and consequently convicted . <p> Her family has long decried that Mary Jane was deprived of government legal assistance . <p> Arraignment deferred anew <p> Despite arguing that there remains no legal impediment , Judge Nelson Tribiana granted the deferment of the arraignment of accused Sergio and Lacanilao for the qualified human trafficking complaint . <p> The arraignment was set last Sept. 18 but was deferred due to the motion for the bill of particulars filed by the defense lawyers . Judge Tribiana , in an Oct. 23 decision , said the prosecution had complied in particularizing the offense that Sergio and Lacanilao committed , and reset the arraignment today . <p> But the defense submitted today a motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Olalia , National Union of Peoples ' Lawyers secretary general and private counsel of Mary Jane and her family , said this should not serve as basis for the deferment of the arraignment . <p> Olalia said the deferment of arraignment can only be on the grounds of a pending judicial review before the Department of Justice , a prejudicial question , and if the accused has an unsound mind . <p> " Unless of course they would like to admit that they have unsound minds ? " Olalia asked , addressing the defense camp . There was an eerie silence for several seconds before Howard Areza of the Public Attorney 's Office and lawyer of the accused , retorted , " But he is asking a rhetorical question . " <p> Later , Areza also hinted that they may also seek a petition for judicial review and said , " We will eventually get into that .

Filipino and French friends and colleagues were successively checking in as " safe " from the succinctly-labeled , but earth-stopping phrase " Paris attacks " . Have you ever had that fraction of a minute when your mind 's knee-jerk interpretation of information was something very comfortingly benign ( it 's a gimmick , it 's a new film , whatever ) ? I had that . Then I googled it . <p> More than a hundred and twenty people have died in the attacks in civilian areas that have been blamed upon fundamentalist groups . Specifically , ISIS has claimed responsibility , saying it was in retaliation to France 's involvement in the crisis in Syria . Social media was , of course , immediately flooded with responses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It may be easy to contrast this overseas tragedy with the one closer to home , namely the continued perpetration of violence against Mindanao lumads . Some already have , in a well-meaning but , in my opinion , misguided attempt to value one tragedy over another . Besides , the current crisis in France and here in Mindanao with the lumad may have more in common than we thought . The current strain that permeates both is the phenomenon of " fundamentalism " . <p> This may be met with some confusion , given that here in the Philippines , the term " fundamentalism " is solely associated with the Moro struggle , stemming from our government 's enthusiastic embrace of the US 's framing of world conflict as that between " the free world " and " Muslim fundamentalism " . This has been widely adopted to the Mindanao context , and expect this framing to gain prominence once again ( but perhaps this time in connection with ISIS ) , especially with the APEC meeting this week in Manila . <p> But this is not the type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , but a more recent ( or only now noticed ) manifestation , which I and my colleagues at the UP have been mulling over and call " lumad fundamentalism " . <p> I will detail this further in a bit , but first let us see what we mean with the word " fundamentalism " . The term nowadays often occurs in the context of geo-political discussions , but I would argue that it is more importantly an anthropological concept . Conrad Kottak ( my go-to source for concise anthropological definitions ) describes " fundamentalism " as an " antimodernist movement " , wherein fundamentalists perceive a dilution , or even corruption , of their beliefs and way of life within the modern mainstream , leading them to seek a return to " an earlier , purer " way of life . What is ironic here , Kottak says , is that anti-modernism , or fundamentalism , could only have emerged under the conditions of modernity . Not all fundamentalist groups engage in conflict , but there is tendency among many of them to assert that other aspects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be subservient to their own often rigid interpretation of beliefs and morals . <p> This tendency we first began to notice to be articulated by the so-called " tribal chieftains " known to be on the AFP 's side . I had written earlier ( Thoughts During A Dialogue ) about how these " tribal chieftains " insisted on " kanya-kanya " , or to each his own , and that no tribe or village ( or support group ) must meddle with the affairs of their neighbors . I had written then that what appeared thence were " tribal leaders " that had completely imbibed the rhetoric of the State ( which stood to gain from keeping the lumad disunited ) , but a more sinister dimension sprouts from their insistence that that perspective was the " real " belief of the lumad , and that no other groups better dare touch them . <p> More recently , in an exchange that was to me very shocking ( as it was reported in the media ) , the gruesome murder of Alcadev educator Emerito Samarca was justified along these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself , Nancy Catamco . Samarca , the " chieftain " Jumar Bucales testified , had been " poisoning " the minds of the lumad , and that was why he was killed ( bringing to mind the death of the great philosopher Socrates , likewise accused of poisoning the minds of young Greeks , and condemned to die by drinking hemlock ) . <p> Responding with a leading question , Catamco asked , " Iyan ba ang rason , dahil siya ay may nagawang kasalanan sa tribo , dahil inapakan niya ang kultura ng tribo sa pagtuturo ng isang ideolohiya ( Is that the reason , because he committed a sin against the tribe , because he trampled on tribal culture by teaching an ideology ) ? " , to which Bucales answered yes . <p> Catamco then asked if the killing had " undergone a ritual " , to which Bucales responded " No . " This line of questioning was ostensibly to establish if the killing was sanctioned by tribal leaders , and god only knows what Catamco intended to do if the answer had been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( warriors ) that committed this act since , having undergone a ritual , the act of killing may be excused by her tribal standards ? We will never know for sure , but what we do know is that Catamco had , time and again , defended " tribal leaders " with AFP links , protected known murder suspects ( such as those in the Fr . Pops Tentorio case ) , and justified the creation of " tribal defense groups " , just another name for paramilitary with high-powered firearms . <p> All these moves ( including the harassments in and outright destruction of community schools ) are legitimized by Catamco and company to be under the auspices of their " traditional way of life " . Like other fundamentalist movements , these have resulted in two things . First is the isolation of the villages that have joined this cohort , rupturing kinship ties and other social linkages with neighboring villages ( our Manobo friends from the bakwit and currently at the Manilakbayan tell us that ever since one of their villages , Barobo , allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there has pretty much become permanent ; one then can not walk straight along the mountain ridge from the interior villages to the more accessible villages and must instead take a roundabout route down the mountain , along the Talomo River , then climb back up ) . <p> Second are the brazen acts of violence that have terrorized many remote lumad communities . Like the gun and bomb attacks in the busy streets of Paris , the very public execution of Samarca , Dionel Campos , and Bello Sinzo , and the brash destruction of the MISFI schoolhouse in White Culaman , among others , were all calculated to instill the deepest fear among those who witness it ( and it is always ensured that there are many witnesses ) . <p> These are all enacted with the articulated rationalization of strict adherence to " the traditional way of life " , of the prevention of " contamination " of the tribe ( the sin , apparently , of award-winning teacher Samarca ) , of keeping " tribal customs " " pristine " and " unchanging " ( made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white or red , or the validity of a ritual performed away from the ancestral domain , never mind that protests worldwide all possess a religious element , that Masses have been held in the streets , and that Filipino liberation theologians allow the use of tuba instead of red wine for the Eucharist ) , and of their unwavering belief that any deviation therefrom must only , absolutely , be the product of " manipulation " by " outside groups " . <p> From Paris to Talaingod , religious and cultural fundamentalism has reared its head to be a true enemy of vibrant peoples and dynamic cultures . But the crucial difference is that lumad fundamentalists here are coddled by the current-regime-in-place . They enjoy still being part of " lawful " society , of having friends in high places , and of being shielded from critical scrutiny . In the end , these lumad fundamentalists are not the rogues or the outsiders that ISIS and Al Qaeda are considered to be , but are clearly integrated in the **28;290;TOOLONG mainstream . <p> Davao Today is a daily online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business and politics in the city and nearby towns and cities are covered by Davao Today news team on a daily basis .

@@3063232 <h> Power crisis now upon us <p> Department of Energy ( DOE ) Secretary Jericho Petilla could now tell naysayers : " I told you so . " In July last year , Petilla already warned about the projected power supply shortage in the early summer of 2015 . <p> Based on this worst-case scenario , the DOE chief recommended to President Aquino to ask Congress to authorize him to declare a state of national emergency on the looming power crisis due to the very thin supply of electricity expected in 2015 . Petilla alerted the public to brace for rotating brownouts in the summer of 2015 due to " very thin reserves " and delays in the operation of some upcoming new power plants . <p> The Energy chief underscored the urgency of this measure as necessary to avoid brownouts next year as some power plant projects or expansion plans may not push through as scheduled by summer . <p> The Senate and House committees on energy went through their respective versions on the proposed grant of special powers to the President as the two chambers differed on solutions to address the looming electricity supply crisis . <p> In November last year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requested passage of the Palace-certified emergency powers for the President . The House committee on energy approved Joint Resolution No. 21 that seeks to grant President Aquino emergency powers to address the looming power crisis in the country . <p> The Senate , on the other hand , has yet to pass on third and final reading the proposed measure as modified by Sen. Serge Osme ? a III . With the Senate coming out with its own version , the measure will thus go through a bicameral conference committee to reconcile the differing provisions before being sent back to their respective chambers for approval . <p> Opinion ( Article MRec ) , pagematch : 1 , sectionmatch : 1 <p> The emergency powers , among other things , Petilla explained would allow the government , through the Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corp . ( PSALM ) to contract additional power . Petilla was recommending additional capacity of up to 500 megawatts , instead of just 200 MW to provide a buffer in case the project deficit becomes bigger than 200 MW . <p> At the time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , namely : the 87 MW Burgos wind scheduled to commence in February ; 150 MW coal plant , an 18MW biomass facility in May ; 10.8MW biomass , a 13.2MW hydropower plant in August ; 67.5MW Pililia wind in September and a 100MW Avion plant in October . <p> Petilla , however , admitted there are also power projects that may not push through for one reason or another . Ideally , the DOE calculated as much as 400 to 500 MW of extra power supply must come on stream no later than April , 2015 to reach a " comfortable " level of reserve capacity that could kick in to prevent any wide power outages . <p> However , the Malampaya natural gas facility in offshore Palawan is scheduled for shut down from March 15 to April 14 , 2015 to undergo preventive maintenance . This would consequently aggravate the power supply situation . <p> When Malampaya underwent preventive maintenance in 2013 , several other power plants also shut down for similar maintenance reasons . This did not only cause power supply interruptions but also was also blamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from DOE data , the occurrence of power outages in 2013 increased to 7.25 percent from 5.75 percent in 2012 . <p> Subsequently in September last year , President Aquino formally asked the 16th Congress for emergency powers . Such powers would give him authority to enter into contracts to raise the generating capacity . Under such a state of national emergency , the President would have the power to address the shortage by contracting new power plants or renting modular generator sets , or gensets . <p> However , the recommended leasing scheme of gensets got shot down early on because it is nothing but a stopgap measure and not a long-term solution as gathered from the sentiments aired in several public hearings in Congress . <p> The House approved instead the DOE 's Interruptible Load Program ( ILP ) in partnership with the private sector and incentives to energy saving measures to decrease possible shortfall of supply as against demand for electricity . <p> Under ILP , large industrial and commercial establishments would disconnect from the grid and use their own generators during peak hours to free up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn , will reimburse firms participating in the ILP for fuel use and other operating costs , and their expenses will be exempted from value-added tax as an incentive . <p> The funds from the Malampaya gas project may be tapped as the estimated cost of the ILP should not exceed P200 million , which was far cheaper than leasing power barges -- for as much as P12 billion -- as what Malaca ? ang had originally proposed . <p> With its request for special powers to address a looming crisis still pending in Congress , rotating brownouts have already started crippling provinces in Luzon and in Visayas for the past two weeks now . Even the DOE was caught by surprise why suddenly these power interruptions have been occurring one after the other this early . <p> The DOE Secretary , in the meantime , has been lately very visible on government-paid infomercials between breaks on prime time television . Fortunately , a good-looking Petilla appears as the government spokesman in promoting tips to cut monthly electric bills through simple installation of energy-saving light bulbs to use of inverters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> While the two chambers were still debating on this measure , Mr. Aquino reassured the public the government has been trying to fast-track the rehabilitation of the Malaya power plant to help augment power supply in Luzon and avert debilitating brownouts in 2015 . <p> The government is now preparing to reactivate the 650-MW Malaya Thermal Power Plant Unit 1 in Rizal province . The newly rehabilitated Malaya power plant might be online by March instead of June or July . It was advanced in the light of these latest rotating brownouts until Congress finally passes the special powers for Mr. Aquino . <p> Once approved by both chambers , that 's the only time it will be sent to President Aquino for approval into law . But of course , the Palace would do its own vetting before this measure is signed into law . Despite the emergency nature of this bill , the feared power crisis is already upon us before it becomes a law .

And the other was a local paper of limited circulation not even distributed in Bagamanoc . <p> The problem with Republic Act 9184 , otherwise known as the Government Procurement Reform Act , and its Implementing Rules and Regulation ( IRR ) is that it does not specify the qualifications of interested bidders in the contracting of Advertising Services , particularly in the publication of local ordinances .

Unfortunately , more than two years after the request , the concerned official in Padre Faura has yet to reply . <p> In addition , the advent of high-end copying machines has made possible the printing of full-size tabloid newspapers in full color .

Rappler comes from the root words " rap " ( to discuss ) + " ripple " ( to make waves ) . <p> MANILA , Philippines -- Imagine your smartphone telling you the best way to get to your destination around Metro Manila 's urban jungle . <p> All you need to do is fire up an app that tells you how to get there : what jeeps , buses , or trains to take , where to alight , and how long it would take to get from point A to point B. <p> But it does more than that . EDSA is congested . Take the train instead , it can say . Or , The lines at the MRT are really long . Better to take a jeep . The app shows you what roads are closed and where traffic is building up . It tells you if the Metro Rail Transit ( MRT ) has broken down ( again ) and whether you should head to the bus bay instead . <p> This kind of comprehensive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the award-winning web service Sakay.ph aims to one day build the platform that would make navigating Metro Manila 's convoluted transport systems much easier . <p> Sakay.ph , which won the Open Community Award at the 2013 Philippine Transit App Challenge , describes itself as " Google Maps or Waze , but for commuting . " Users simply input their starting point and destination , and the service comes up with a list of routes and an accompanying map showing the jeeps or buses the user should take , where to get off , and an estimate of how much to pay . <p> Sakay first started as a side project by Philip Cheang and Thomas Dy as an entry to the hackathon , which challenged software developers to create an app based on data made publicly available by the Department of Transportation and Communication ( DOTC ) . <p> Since then , Sakay -- now a full-fledged product of their software company By Implication -- has added more new features , including a recently launched mobile app , with even bigger plans in the works . <p> Developing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an effort to bring order to the city 's transportation system using data and technology , Cheang says . <p> " There 's a lot of problems with transport here locally , and not a lot of it is easily fixable . But the one we could 've addressed was information on how to get around , " he tells Rappler . <p> " If you go to other countries , the transit systems they have are very comprehensive ... it 's very easy for you to look up either paper-based or app-based information . We do n't have anything like that here . So we thought , why not attempt to bring some of that information , that order , here . " <p> Commuters looking for solutions <p> Though its popularity has skyrocketed since its launch , Sakay is not the first service to bring a more planned and scientific approach to travel in Metro Manila , home to about 12 million residents and plagued by monstrous traffic jams -- a situation that , if left unchecked , could cost the Philippines P6 billion every day by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have little choice : they can either sit for hours along EDSA in cramped jeeps and buses , or they can push and shove their way inside one of the coaches of the Light Rail Transit ( LRT ) and the Metro Rail Transit ( MRT ) . <p> But even the MRT is n't as reliable as it once was . Glitch after glitch has made it a constant mainstay in the news , and the Senate has even held hearings to figure out what went wrong with the aging , overburdened train line . <p> FULL TRAINS . Outgoing passengers struggle in a jam-packed train ride . <p> " Metro Manila is not a planned city , it 's a mess , " says Sakay 's Kenneth Yu . " The potential for a gigantic transpo f -- #k up has always been built into Metro Manila . It 's just never been as obviously problematic as now . " <p> " On the other hand , the capability of technology , of people and of systems to give a solution is also improving , " he adds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know in real-time which roads to avoid and what new routes to take . <p> But for commuters , there 's no such app , says Sakay 's Rodrick Tan . <p> " Sobrang kawawa ang commuters . Ang hirap na nga mag-commute in the first place , and then there 's no data available to them , " he says . <p> Their own web service is meant to fill in that information gap , but the team has much more ambitious plans : they want Sakay to be the one-stop app of choice , offering both directions and real-time updates on the state of the city 's mass transport systems . <p> " Commuters are really looking for information , but it 's not comprehensive . One possible way is to merge all of those , to make it readable , to create a one-stop access for seeing what 's the best possible route , the status of roads , and advisories , " Tan says . <p> Such an app would take a significant amount of time , resources , and manpower . It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking it one feature at a time . <p> Immediate impact <p> Sakay is not the only project of By Implication , but it 's certainly the most successful one in terms of its impact on people . <p> " Sakay and commuting directions , it 's basically non-existent . It 's a totally new thing in the market rather than improving on an existing thing . In terms of the number of people that we helped and depth of how we helped them , it 's pretty big , " Tan says . <p> In over a year , more than 150,000 people have used Sakay . Just last month , around 30,000 users visited the site . The spike of interest -- especially after the launch of the mobile app , and the redesign early this year -- has led the team to keep thinking up new ideas and fresh updates to improve the service . <p> WAZE FOR COMMUTING . The web service aims to provide the best possible commute routes for users . Photo courtesy of Philip Cheang <p> One of the new features that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feature that will allow users with no WiFi or 3G connections to get commute directions via text message . <p> It 's not actually a new feature , Cheang admits . They used to already offer the service , using a cheap Android phone programmed with software to send out commute instructions to users via unli-text . <p> It turned out that the cheap phone plus unli-text combination could n't handle the deluge of inquiries , he says . <p> " That was n't really sustainable , " Cheang says . " One , it was a really cheap Android phone . We got featured on the news once , then the phone kept ringing and eventually crashed . Two , we were cited for violating fair-use policy . I think we were sending out more than a thousand texts in less than an hour . So hindi kinaya ng phone , di kinaya ng unli-text . " <p> " But we actually have a real gateway now , " he adds . <p> Rolling out new features and keeping their users engaged is critical for the Sakay team -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into reality . <p> 15-MAN TEAM . By Implication , the company behind Sakay.ph , in their office in Quezon City . Photo courtesy of Philip Cheang <p> Upcoming plans <p> Right now , the Sakay team is currently working to add new modes of transportation , such as FX and UV Express shuttles , the Comet e-shuttle , and tricycles . <p> Soon , they 're planning on tapping their own user base to add new routes or correct wrong ones , to keep the commute instructions up-to-date . <p> This last is probably one of the biggest challenges in a service like Sakay . Roads close , jeeps change routes , and better ways of getting to point A from point B come up all the time . How will Sakay keep up with all these changes ? <p> It 's not something they can do manually on a massive scale , Tan says . It would be too costly , and too time-consuming . Instead , the service will rely on crowdsourcing to self-moderate the information that comes up on the system . <p> " A lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If you look at places like Reddit , Digg , and Slashdot , and a lot of places where people upvote things , people will downvote things that do n't work ... We intend to take something similar . " <p> " I think the assumption is people are more willing to help than screw with systems . For Sakay , I think the user base is very loyal , users would be willing to help , " says Tan . <p> The team could also take a leaf from the way the original transport data on which Sakay was based was gathered in the first place . Cheang narrates how the DOTC got students to ride jeepneys with smartphones that logged the routes , then compiled all the data . <p> Sakay could use a similar approach in the future , by allowing their users to record the routes using the Sakay mobile app . <p> " It could serve that same purpose . Okay , I 'm on a jeep that 's not here yet , why do n't I record this path ? Or if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a route that passes here . Ir I see a route on the website that 's wrong , why do n't I submit a correction ? We 're going to try to build that data via people submitting corrections , additions , via crowdsourcing , " Cheang says . <p> But building that platform would take more than just time and hard work . It would need funding , and the Sakay team is eyeing contextual , location-based ads to monetize the service and make it self-sustainable . <p> They are also planning to partner with government agencies , in a step to get their name more visible and to make Sakay much more than just a service for giving directions . <p> Imagine being able to get updates on how congested EDSA is , whether it 's a good idea to take the MRT , what routes to take best , and government advisories on road closures and rerouting schemes , all in one app . <p> " That stuff I 'd really like to see , because then it means Sakay would be more than just directions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to figure it out .

While the new legal framework includes approximations of some measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put forward by Greenpeace and a handful of Chilean politicians last year , environmentalists charge that there are too many loopholes for mining companies to exploit . <p> The new glacier law framework consists of 14 amendments to an earlier law proposed last year , according to Chilean newspaper La Segunda and radio station Radio UChile . These amendments would assign legal classification to different kinds of glaciers , as well as to the frozen land surrounding them , declare them national " patrimony " to be protected by the government , and allow for the revision of environmental permits already granted for projects that would interfere with glaciers . Such permits could not be revoked , but companies could be required to take additional measures to mitigate the impacts their projects would have on glaciers . The law would also describe specific kinds of activities prohibited on glaciers designated as requiring special protection . <p> The " five-star " proposal included a few extra steps : de facto protection of all areas defined as " glaciers , " as well as surrounding land , banning any activity that damages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glaciers to stop doing so . <p> Environmentalists have been clamoring for good glacier laws in recent months with a string of colorful protests . In January , Greenpeace activists parked themselves in front of the presidential palace , La Moneda , in the capital city of Santiago with a mock food cart full of withered and dried up fruits and vegetables for the " Market without Glaciers . " Produce was advertised at outrageous prices ( $5,000 pesos , or around US$7 , for every ratty piece of corn ) . On Twitter , Matias Asun , head of Greenpeace Chile , explained in Spanish that this is what the country 's produce would look like if all of its glaciers were destroyed . <p> A few months earlier , on Sept. 27 , two thousand people , many of them children wearing superhero costumes , marched to the La Moneda to urge president Bachelet to write glacier protection laws . And last March , Chilean Greenpeace activists declared a " Glacier Republic , " a sovereign state covering 23,000 square kilometers of glaciers in Chile that already has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a law to protect Chile 's glaciers . <p> According to at least one politician , 80 to 85 percent of all glacier surface area in Chile exists within its national parks . Under the new legal framework , the fate of the rest of the glaciers would be determined by the council of ministers as opposed to by legislation . Greenpeace 's Asun told Radio UChile that he believes this would open such decisions up to political influence from mining companies such as Barrick Gold , Angloamerican , Los Pelambres de Luksic and Codelco . <p> Chile 's neighbor Argentina adopted a glacier protection law in 2010 that defines glacier broadly to include rock glaciers and frozen groundwater left by receding glaciers , because some scientists feel these are key sources of glacier water reserves . The Argentine law has caused delays in a few mining projects , such as Canada 's Osisko Famatina gold exploration and the Argentine operations of Barrick Gold 's Pascua Lama gold and silver mine . But even before a law has been passed in Chile , the Chilean operations Pascua-Lama have been suspended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

@@3108239 <p> Recently , a fossil of a sea creature has been unearthed which is an ancient ancestor of arachnids , insects , and crustaceans . However , the researchers have spotted something unexpected on the fossil . Aegirocassis benmoulae , named after the Moroccan fossil hunter Mohamed Ben Moula , lived 480 million years ago during the Cambrian period . It belonged to the family anomalocaridid which is an earlier version of arthropods . A distinct feature of the creature is that it measured about 7 feet and has been described as a massive lobster-like sea creature . <p> Usually it is believed that early arthropods had only one set of flaps or limb-like body parts , known as ventral flaps , on their lower bodies which they used for breathing . However , the new fossil has surprised the researchers by showing another set of flaps , known as dorsal flaps , on the back side of its lower segment , which are used for swimming . But , unlike modern arthropods , the flaps in the fossil were not joined together . <p> Paleobiologist Peter V Roy of the Yale University said " And so for weeks , I went back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flaps are there , I 'm not being crazy , and I 'm not seeing things . " The recent discovery encouraged the researcher to reexamine previous fossils of anomalocaridids and they found that there were actually two flaps all along and they were not identified as they were well hidden . Another interesting finding is that the creature ate plankton unlike most of its fellow family members . Roy has also revealed that this newly identified arthropod was one of the largest to have ever existed and was much bigger as compared to those that live today . <p> Brian Thompson has been a science journalist since past 15 years and continues his journey with the Astronomy , Space and Social Science changes happened so far in this industry .

It is a toast to his initiative and respect for indigenous knowledge that sustained our Cordillera mossy forests for generations as the life-blood of lowland agriculture and power generation in Northern Philippines . Manny passed on recently at 54. - RD ) <p> VILLAGE leader Paul Casiwan said they found four types of acorns in the remaining mossy forests . He sounded like he was trying to hide his excitement over the find . The acorns sounded like coffee beans as he poured them out of jute sacks and into iron buckets . <p> His group had spent days gathering and sorting them according to shape , texture , and size and variety . <p> They were of four sizes . The three smaller ones were ovate , shaped like bullets , but with short pins at the tip and looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round , like a dull chestnut . Casiwan cracked a shell , popped the kernel into his mouth and chomped . He cracked another and offered the meat to visitors . It was hard , with an astringent taste like betel nut . <p> Acorns are basic food for birds and other animals that enrich the biodiversity of the mossy forest , he said . <p> Fellow worker Dominga Baliaga raked her hands into one of the aggregate piles , looking for those with tiny , whitish sprouts that must and damp coaxed out of their shells -- through the pins . Contrasted with the dominant color of chestnut , those with shoots were easy to spot . <p> Soon the germinating seeds will be sown in pots in tree nurseries they had carved and flattened out of steep mountainsides overlooking tributaries of the Abra River . When their leaves develop , they will be replanted in open spaces to expand the vanishing mossy forest cover of Agawa . <p> Until they started picking and examining seeds , villagers in Agawa and in neighboring barangays in northwestern Besao town , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forests contain . They now have to have an eye for detail to be able to properly identify the different tree species , together with the herbs and plants they 'll have to propagate as source of tribal medicine . <p> The propagation of " payen " ( the native name for oak ) , " da-il " ( petroleum nut ) and other mossy forest species was part of a forest biodiversity project a few years back for Agawa and the adjoining barangays of Ambagiw , Gueday and Lacma-an in Besao . <p> Months later , a women 's group in Bayyo Barangay in the capital town of Bontoc also launched a similar community-based forest biodiversity project . It was concentrated in Mt . Polis , the fragile water source for several towns in Mt . Province and Ifugao that is also watershed of the Chico River flowing into the rice lands of the Cagayan Valley . <p> The two projects scheduled for two to three years were supported by the Small Grants Program of the United Nations Programme then headed by Angie Cunanan .

Province , also mobilized the northern barangays of Sagada town for a headwaters enhancement project , also in a tie-up with SGP-UNDP . <p> He admitted that regular government outlays for forestry programs are very limited and spread too thin , prompting the need to tap other support institutions for the preservation of the mossy forests . <p> Until now , the mossy and pine forests that are unique to the village and most of the Cordilleras have been overlooked in the national forestry master plan . Conservation efforts are focused more on the common tropical foliage of these islands , from the mangrove to the dipterocarp and molave found up to 800 meters above sea level . <p> Unlike the lower forests , the dwindling pine and mossy forests have been classified only for protection , without provisions for reforestation and expansion Yet these higher ecosystems , specially the mossy forests , make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the source of water that is the lifeblood of the electric dams and the lowland farms . <p> " Mossy forest conservation and development had not been given attention by development agencies in the past , " noted the Agawa project paper .

" <p> As the headwaters , the mossy forest acts like a sponge that gradually releases rainwater into the tributaries of river systems . While it 's damp condition insulates it from heat , its natural elevation immediately above or beside the easily combustible pine stands makes it partly vulnerable to fires . <p> " Forest fires prevalent during the dry season creep into the edges of the mossy forest , " the Bayyo project noted . <p> The Bayyo women also pointed out that the expansion through regeneration of pine stands within areas formerly covered by oak and other species contributes to mossy forest and biodiversity reduction . <p> This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pine to exude resin toxic to other species , enabling it to spread and dominate areas earlier cleared by fires or for swidden farms .

Some surviving oaks are limited to the waterway gullies or below the invasive conifer stands . <p> For generations , traditional village forest management systems , rather than state policies that sometimes clash with time-tested tribal laws , protected the integrity of the pine and the dwarf oak forests . Like the mossy forest , however , these indigenous practices that were the original models of community-based resource management are also vanishing . <p> The two projects in Agawa and Bayyo , therefore , were anchored on the revival and documentation of these traditional practices , together with the folk wisdom on medicinal species . <p> In one of the Bayyo nurseries , Diana Peta-ul and Alicia Wayasen showed visitors several types of mountain tea which they claim possess therapeutic properties .

Rappler comes from the root words " rap " ( to discuss ) + " ripple " ( to make waves ) . <h> The sanctity of divorce <p> Every time I heard " sanctity " used to describe sex , I wondered whether the anti-RH Bill supporters were having the same kind I was having . While sex can elicit an " oh my God , " using " holy " in fighting the Reproductive Health bill was manipulative . Anti-RH Bill supporters argued that sex should only happen between married couples who want to populate the country . ( READ : Will PH have a divorce law ? ) <p> They conveniently ignored that , as of June 2014 , the Philippines has the highest teenage pregnancy rates among ASEAN nations or that baby-making is only one of a thousand reasons people have sex -- garden-variety desire is profane but as valid . Those unaffected by the RH bill could afford to buy contraception . Most affected , as usual , are the poor . ( READ : Divorce : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At first blush , " sanctity " is an inspiring word but when it comes to effecting change , it slows it to a glacial pace . Sanctity should be heard echoing in a church , not Congress .

The reasoning is the same , the vocabulary only slightly different , and that word " sanctity " rears its misused head . <p> As with the RH Bill , the reasons for legalizing divorce are diverse and urgent , and they 've been discussed on many platforms .

Marriages in the Philippines succeed but they also fail , with our own politicians and celebrities proving the latter . However , a well-heeled couple can apply for an an annulment or legal separation , if they can prove bigamy and psychological incapacitation ( i.e. crazy ) , among other reasons . <p> Again , as with the RH Bill , numbers prove that the divorce bill can improve Filipinos ' lives : It will make the process 30-40% less expensive than legal separation or annulment . More than 60% of those who apply for annulment are women . It will make divorce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anti-divorce law advocates are quick to use children as the ultimate shield in their argument against divorce .

I wish they had a more amicable divorce so I could have known them as happy people . " All studies show that children and adults , regardless of age , race , or income , are , on average , healthier and more well-adjusted when they 're raised with happy couples rather than unhappy ones . <p> While research shows that people who are happily married live longer , the same studies show a correlation between chronic illness and unhappy unions . <p> Yet , many Filipino citizens and a disappointing number of lawmakers continue to live in a Nicholas Sparks novel where married couples grow old together while the sun sets behind them . The protagonists ' fights are charming ; money , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couples have sex in the middle of a rainstorm and their hair still looks incredible the morning after . <p> And if their marriages fail ? You 're immature , according to the CBCP , which asserts : " A failed marriage is not an argument for divorce . It is rather proof of the necessity that only mature people enter into it . " It 's a condescending blanket statement about people who enter into the institution and decide they want out . <p> Archbishop Socrates Villegas , head of the CBCP , describes divorce advocates and seekers as if they are delusional : " The supposed suffering that a spouse must bear owing to a failed marriage is more imagined than real , and comes only upon one who does not make use of the remedies already available under existing law . " <p> The remedies he 's referring to are working through it and , if that fails , applying for annulment or legal separation . <p> Why are policies about marriage and sex informed by the CBCP for whom they are only abstractions ? While I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their voices should not be as influential as they are in shaping the law . <p> Those who fight divorce law like to fudge facts . An example is Bishop Teodoro C. Bacani Jr who said , " There is also damage to the children -- studies have shown in general that they fare worst in life , in their studies and relationships . " They also cite histrionic Hollywood examples and filtered paperback fantasies to support their beliefs . <p> The moment the D-word comes up , the phrase " sanctity of marriage " inevitably follows . Those with this limited view of marriage have an even more myopic view of divorce , with our own president and congressmen and women alluding to Hollywood celebrities ( e.g. Britney Spears , Elizabeth Taylor ) in their arguments . <p> Netizens are even grosser with their language , comparing advocating divorce to switching partners as if changing underwear . A Filipino friend , who is miserable in his marriage , says , " You do n't spit it out just because it scalds your tongue . " Suddenly , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Divorce cheapens marriage , " cry others . The financial metaphor is ironic , considering that the only people who can afford to end a marriage are the privileged or the lucky , who find themselves a pro bono lawyer . <p> My grandmother , who still mourns Sharon Cuneta and Gabby Concepcion 's break-up , told me when I was 20 years old to marry a Filipino because " a Filipino ca n't leave you . " Having seen David Hasselhoff kiss different women on TV , she believes that divorce legalizes the marital version of musical chairs . <p> She is on the same page as Senator Tito Sotto and Senator Serge Osmena , whose views on divorce are so solipsistic and self-centered , they mention their wives in their arguments . Senator Bongbong Marcos said that he has no reason to support the bill because " I love my wife . I do not want to divorce her . " Their soundbites sound like Hallmark greeting cards gone awry . ( READ : Most Senate bets vs divorce ) <p> Their comments illustrate their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill , and the challenges of going through one . They also illustrate a lack of empathy , with the commentators unable ( or unwilling ) to imagine a marriage unlike theirs . I would not care about their Pollyanna statements , if not for the fact that they shape policy . <p> Divorce is rarely easy for anyone and everyone is changed by it . While there are some hasty divorces out there , they are an anomaly . Part of the anti-divorce law reverie includes imagining all divorced couples as selfish , amoral , and miserable . Doing so strengthens their case . <p> Happiness , they suggest , should be available only to those who stick with the institution of marriage , till death do them part , regardless of the situation . " You 've made your marital bed , " they seem to say . " Now lie in it and call it ' marriage , ' even if there 's no love , no safety or trust , and , in some cases , no partner . " <p> There are many stories about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) who ended their first marriage and continued onto happier lives with well-adjusted children . Many friends and my husband are children from second marriages . But the CBCP and the anti-divorce law supporters like to discount these narratives . They make barring divorce sound like protection from broken families and what Mary Poppins calls " pie-crust promises , easily made , easily broken . " <p> Divorce does not push people into capricious marriages any more than wearing a seatbelt encourages speeding . <p> A Filipino Catholic married to an American , I am thrilled the divorce law is back on the Filipino discussion table . My supporting it says nothing about the status of my own relationship . To advocate for divorce law is to give other Filipinos opportunities to pursue their own freedom , their happiness . <p> I know from experience . <p> My husband had been married before , and that knowledge did n't stop me from falling in mad , mad love with his kind eyes and his robust laughter . If not for divorce , we would have never met and he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our bodies when we promised to be together till the end . I took his name . We have a joint bank account and the same health insurance plan and we 're planning for our future family .

My husband , who makes my heart flutter , is my best friend and partner rolled into one , and I plan on going to Tuesday-night movies with him for the rest of my days . I have an emergency contact . I get to make out with him ! <p> And I choose him back , every day , because he is , as poet Robert Creeley writes , " my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I choose him because I want to , not because the law and the Church force me to stay . I do not think a marriage license or contract is sacred but free will and love are . <p> I am grateful for him and our life together and I am sure that we 'll be together for the long haul , even though divorce is legal here . <p> It is necessary . Divorce protects the safety and dignity of people who enter into marriage . If marriage is the home a couple builds together , divorce is not its front door but its fire escape .

@@3328240 <h> Outdated Immigration law <p> More than out of irritation , Speaker Feliciano Belmonte Jr . was rightly indignant when he called for a House investigation into the raging controversy rocking the Bureau of Immigration ( BI ) . This was after the feud among the three-man Immigration Board over the aborted release of Chinese fugitive Wang Bo dragged the House of Representatives into the middle of the controversy . <p> The apple of discord among the BI officials is the alleged P400 million bribe squeezed out from Wang in return for his not being deported back to China where he is facing a string of criminal cases . The feud among the three-man BI Board , headed by commissioner Sigfred Mison and associate commissioners Abdullah Mangotara and Gilbert Respizo , got the Speaker riled up . <p> The Speaker naturally blew his top after it was peddled out in media that some P400-million bribe money from Wang was squeezed out by certain BI top officials who are allegedly very close to the Liberal Party ( LP ) allies of President Aquino in the 16th Congress . The bribe money was purportedly used to pay off pro-administration members of the House special ad hoc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Basic Law ( BBL ) for plenary debate . <p> It was Speaker Belmonte who created this House special ad hoc committee after President Aquino endorsed its speedy approval into law by Congress . The Speaker designated Cagayan de Oro Rep. Rufus Rodriguez as chairman . By sheer coincidence or by design by the anti-BBL rumormongers , Rodriguez was once the Immigration chief during the shortened term of former President Joseph Estrada . <p> The reported bribery controversy at the BI erupted a few days after President Aquino met at the Palace with Rodriguez and the rest of pro-administration congressmen of the House special ad hoc committee . Rodriguez confirmed they indeed had a meeting with President Aquino and for almost 12 hours discussed with him the issues against the proposed Palace BBL draft . <p> The House special ad hoc committee would later vote 50-17-1 approving the BBL draft , after amending it , for plenary debate .

As per the account of one newspaper ( not The STAR ) , the P400 million bribe money paid by Wang was distributed allegedly to the congressmen after they attended the meeting with President Aquino at the Palace . <p> So the Speaker took it upon himself to initiate a legislative investigation into this BI controversy , especially those involving the three BI commissioners . Belmonte filed the other day a House Resolution calling for this inquiry . Majority Leader Neptali Gonzales II and Minority Leader Ronaldo Zamora signed the Belmonte House Resolution as co-authors . <p> " We want to investigate the ( BI ) for the allegation of fixing by Wang Bo . The three commissioners are pointing at each other . If there is finger pointing , there must be some truth to it , " Belmonte fumed the other day . <p> Since BI is an attached agency of the Department of Justice , Secretary Leila de Lima placed all three BI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BI commissioners to her office yesterday and who reportedly told her about the " technicalities " in the case of Wang .

Wang , employed at the ELC Technology Consulting Co . Inc. based in the Cagayan Economic Zone , will remain in the BI 's custody while his appeal is pending with the DOJ . <p> While the Lower House is set to probe the BI on this case , De Lima told reporters yesterday she would resolve the appeal filed by Wang at her level .

Thus , we are prone to believe any allegations , especially when there is indecent haste in the approval of any bills of import in Congress . <p> But the House inquiry would be a timely opportunity for Congress to finally act on the long pending bill that seeks to modernize the BI . Towards this end , the Joint Foreign Chambers ( JFC ) has recommended to the House and Senate committees on justice to pass into law the proposed " Immigration Act " pending in Congress . The JFC in particular urged Congress to exclude a provision that authorizes the BI to pass on payment of overtime fees of immigration officers charged to airline companies and shippers , respectively . <p> Part of the modernization of immigration services , the JFC cited , is the ability of government to match the 24/7 operations of international airlines as major partners of the country 's tourism development . <p> To spare this added burden on private companies , the JFC supports the provision in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percentage share from its income generated so that the agency , they pointed out , could absorb the overtime payments of its immigration officers under its annual budget . <p> According to Mison , the BI generated P3 billion income last year .

This is why , Mison explained , they have to pass on the overtime charges of BI officers to airline firms and shippers . <p> This latest controversy at the BI should prod lawmakers to get this proposed Immigration Act passed into law to reduce , if not totally eliminate the loopholes in the law that allows such corruption to persist through the years . <p> The proposed bill seeks to amend Commonwealth Act 613 which created the BI in the 1940s . That 's how outdated the BI law and its existing rules and regulations that have been the source of these " technicalities " and shenanigans in this graft-prone agency of government . @ @

If the beacons are rolled out without the appropriate authorisation -- which has not been given -- it would be illegal . And given that the devices would interfere with emergency services broadcasts , I reckon it will never get permission . <p> It was a pretty informative statement from the ACMA : <p> In case you ca n't read the above , it says this : <p> " The Australian Communications and Media Authority provided no support for the five day blackspot beacon trial either in financial or other terms , apart from issuing a scientific trial transmitter licence for a limited duration test . The ACMA 's trial guidelines makes clear that the issuing of scientific trial licences does not imply ACMA support for the technology or imply that the ACMA would issue long term licences . <p> The ACMA will be requesting that the ACMA logo on the blackspots website be removed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ website also contains a video suggesting that these blackspot transmitters are being rolled out through NSW . The ACMA has not licensed this technology for operational deployment . Any such roll out would be unlawful . <p> The ACMA would need to address considerable regulatory challenges to permanently authorise a device that purposefully interferes with broadcast transmissions . Given the critical role of radio broadcasting in emergencies , this is unlikely to be contemplated without the full and informed support of the emergency service community , and following proper consultation with broadcasters themselves . <p> As such , the ACMA has referred the matter of over-broadcasting technologies to the Capability Development Sub-committee of the Australian New Zealand Emergency Management Committee for consideration of referral of this issue to the broader emergency service organisation community . The ACMA has asked that the ANZMEC seek the views of emergency management experts on whether this technology should play a role in emergency management and how that might impact on existing broadcast arrangements . The ACMA understands that the technology is now being considered by ANZMEC members . <p> As you 'll also see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for its logo to be used on the Blackspot Beacons case study site , and asked for it to be removed . <p> So we went to Transport NSW to ask whether despite the hurdles , the organisation was indeed planning for Blackspot Beacons to be rolled out as the awards video claimed . <p> Late yesterday afternoon , slightly to our surprise , they answered a different question in a very short statement . <p> Source : Transport for NSW <p> So the awards entry submission to the Lions had not been authorised by the client . <p> It was starting to look like it could be one of those classic scammy awards entries -- a clever proof of concept of something we 're probably not going to see in the real world . If you like the definition of scam as being work that would never exist without award competitions , then it might just fit . <p> As afternoon turned into evening , things then became a bit like one of those bad hacker movies where the data starts vanishing in front of your eyes . Over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have written about the campaign -- Digital Buzz Blog , deleted the article . Funnily enough , Digital Buzz is edited by the MD and ECD of VML Australia , Aden Hepburn . <p> Even more curiously , the shortlisted entries then vanished from the Cannes Lions website . <p> When we left the office last night , one of the few places where a reference to Blackspot Beacons remained was on the global VML site . By the time I got into the office at 7am today , it had vanished from there too . <p> It was an impressive display of near-real time digital decontamination . <p> Obviously , we 'd taken the precaution of taking screenshots of the sites and backing up the video before starting to ask questions . That 's the only reason you can still see the video above . <p> Not only that , but the rules say the work needs to have been implemented within the judging period of the 12 months up to April 30 . <p> Source : Cannes Lions website <p> So it looked to us that , much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch with the organisers of the Cannes Lions , owned up that they did n't have client permission and duly been disqualified . <p> We did n't get much of an answer from VML . Aden Hepburn told us he was n't allowed to give us a comment . At 11pm last night the agency sent my colleague Miranda Ward the following not-very-illuminating statement : <p> Perhaps slightly charitably , one theory I had was this : Maybe the agency did the project on behalf of the client ; Perhaps it got some sort of informal okay to put in an entry , but never got the case study video authorised ; Perhaps the claim that the Beacons were being rolled out was going too far ; Not wanting the PR embarrassment of seeming to be in a fight with ACMA or having no interest in pursuing what looks like a regulatory dead end , Transport NSW cut VML loose . <p> Just a theory , I stress . But it would n't have been the worst case of awards cheating in the world . <p> But this is where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cannes Lions , and how they have chosen to handle this . <p> This year the Lions topped 40,000 entries for the first time . That equates to well over $30m in entry fees alone . And that 's before attendance fees and all those duplicate trophy sales . <p> And VML is owned by WPP , the world 's biggest holding company ( and awards-enterer ) . <p> Indeed , the four shortlistings by VML counted towards a points tally which saw WPP named as Holding Company of the Year at Cannes . So although the entries did n't win any trophies , shortlistings still matter . <p> And I suppose you 'd expect the Cannes Lions to go the extra mile to save their biggest client from unnecessary embarrassment . <p> This is where things get a bit smelly . <p> You see , VML has not been disqualified . <p> Miranda sent a series of questions to the Cannes Lions overnight . Early this morning , the organisation 's London-based chief executive Philip Thomas sent the following reply , with his answers in bold next to Miranda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read the above , the answer says : " We were asked to remove them because the client needed to have the technology validated for public health and safety reasons . We complied . " <p> After all , it 's health and safety , in n it ? You ca n't be too careful . <p> But they 've absolutely not been disqualified because " we have no reason to disqualify them " . <p> Apart from VML making a misleading claim in the case study video and not getting the client 's permission to enter , that is . <p> Still , perhaps it 's all part of a legitimate system that says you can gracefully withdraw an entry rather than be disqualified . So let 's go back to those Cannes Lions entry rules : <p> Source : Cannes Lions website <p> The rules explicitly and specifically state that you ca n't withdraw an entry after May 15 . <p> There 's another curious thing about the rules . They state : <p> In the event of a complaint against any winning or shortlisted entry , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will request detailed documentation from all parties concerned including the complainant , the entrants and the client . <p> So will Cannes be investigating ? " We have not been contacted by the client " . <p> This feels like something of a loophole . <p> In this case there are public statements from two government bodies , with the ACMA stating that its logo is incorrectly on the project site and disproving a key claim of the awards entry . The other the client saying they have not authorised the entry . <p> But apparently unless the client actually complains to Cannes themselves , it wo n't be investigated . That looks like a bit of a flaw , does n't it ? <p> If you 're one of those clients more interested in achieving stuff than winning awards , would you be particularly motivated to work out how to complain to an organisation you might not know much about , about an issue you do n't care about ? <p> Or here 's another wonderful potential loophole : If it takes a complaint from a client to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fictional client for your wonderful piece of scam advertising ? Then there 's nobody who actually exists who can complain . <p> Or is anybody else entitled to complain ? Can a rival agency ? Can I ? <p> We emailed Mr Thomas first thing today to ask for clarification on why the rules have been ignored around the May 15 cutoff for withdrawing entries . He may have already gone to bed , because we did n't get an answer . But of course , we 'll update you on that point if we do . <h> Comments <p> An eminently riveting read , Tim . Alas , it is indeed impossible for the organisers to disqualify anyone even with the most irrefutable evidence of skulduggery , deceit , lying , fraud and cheating . <p> It would be the corporate equivalent of cutting one 's nose . Not least , offending and embarrassing their biggest single customer . Why ? Because advertising is a business based on over claims and exaggerations . What 's more , clients have never looked to agencies to be paragons of trust and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to set , let alone have any standards for governance , transparency , and values in the way we conduct our business . <p> It 's the same way , no one is actually shocked when a used car salesmen caught with evidence of underhanded practises . Or a hooker gives a John crabs . <p> The positioning of Cannes as the standard bearer of advertising has instead proved to further demonstrate the depths we will sink to as an industry . It serves to confirm every doubt clients have about us : how we operate , the complete disregard to solving real client problems and the dishonest means we employ .

@@3480231 <h> DHS publishes ' expanded ' provisional waiver rule for 3/10-year bar <p> The USCIS has published a proposed rule expanding eligibility for a provisional waiver of the 3/10 -year bar . The expanded provisional waiver will include " all aliens " statutorily eligible for the waiver . At present , only immediate relatives of US citizens ( spouse , parents , and child ) may apply for a provisional waiver of the 3/10-year bar , before they depart the US for immigrant visa processing at the US embassy , provided they demonstrate " extreme hardship " on a US citizen spouse or parent . <p> The proposed rule expands eligibility in two ways : <p> * Not only are immediate relatives of US citizens eligible for a provisional waiver , but also other family and employment-based categories . <p> * A person can demonstrate " extreme hardship " not only on a US citizen parent or spouse , but also on an immigrant ( LPR ) spouse or parent . <p> A provisional waiver could benefit people who are ineligible to adjust status in the US , such as : <p> * crewman ( or jump ships ) , who do not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MRec ) , pagematch : 1 , sectionmatch : 1 <p> * people who entered the US without inspection ( EWI ) , but do not have the benefit of Section 245(i) ; and <p> * people who entered the US on a K-1 fianc ? e visa , but did not marry the US citizen who petitioned them , but instead married a different American . <p> In all these cases , the person is ordinarily not eligible to receive a green card ( adjust status ) in the US , but instead must go back to the Philippines for an immigrant visa , which could trigger the 3/10-year bar . The purpose of this regulation is to shorten the amount of time these people are separated from their family members , while they process their immigrant visas overseas at the embassy . <p> However , before you jump on a plane for Manila , here are some FAQs about this regulation : <p> 1 . What is the 3/10-year bar ? The 3/10-year bar is a law , which basically states that anyone who is out of status @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than a year , and then departs the US , is barred from returning to the US for 3 years . Anyone who had been out of status for more than one year , and then departs is barred from returning for 10 years . This 3/10-year bar is triggered only when the alien departs the US . <p> 2 . What is the procedure currently in place for people who are subject to the 3/10-year bar ? Under current law and procedures , when a person has been found to have triggered the 3/10 year bar ( by departing the US after being out of status for more than 180 days ) , the person must apply for a waiver ( or forgiveness ) at the US embassy by demonstrating certain relatives ( called " qualifying relatives " ) would suffer " extreme hardship " if the waiver is not granted . At present , these qualifying relatives include the person 's spouse or parent who is a US citizen or lawful permanent resident ( LPR ) . A child is not considered a " qualifying relative " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , the alien must apply for the waiver only after he or she departs the US and applies for the immigrant visa at the embassy . In <p> addition , the adjudication of the waiver may take weeks , months , or even years to be completed . In the meantime , the family is separated for a lengthy period of time , waiting for the waiver to be processed . <p> 3 . Who is eligible under the originalexisting " provisional waiver " process ? The only family members currently eligible for the existing provisional waiver are immediate relatives ( spouse , parent , or minor child ) of a US citizen , and only where a US citizen parent or spouse would suffer extreme hardship . <p> 4 . Who is eligible under the proposed expanded provisional waiver process ? In addition to " immediate relatives " , a petition by an LPR ( green card holder ) relative or an employer would also qualify , or where the " qualifying relative " is an LPR spouse or parent . For example , if you have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petitioned by your USC child ( which is faster ) , and qualify for a provisional waiver by demonstrating extreme hardship on your LPR spouse or parent . Similarly , if you were petitioned by an employer and have an LPR parent , you could also qualify for the provisional waiver , by demonstrating extreme hardship on your LPR parent . <p> 5 . What are the benefits of the " provisional waiver " program ? This procedure would allow qualified aliens , with a US citizen or LPR parent or spouse , to apply for a waiver of the 3/10 year bar , while still in the US , and before they depart the US for immigrant visa processing overseas . If the waiver is granted , they would then depart the US ( with the approved waiver in hand ) , and would not have to wait several months outside the US to process that 3/10 year bar waiver . <p> 6 . Would this provisional waiver process apply to other immigration violations or grounds of inadmissibility ? No . This provisional waiver applies only to the 3/10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as fraud ( assumed name entry ) , criminal convictions , and the like , which also require a waiver , the person would have to apply for all such waivers outside the US <p> 7 . If I 'm being petitioned as an immediate relative , do I really need to depart the US ? In many cases , people being petitioned as an " immediate relative " can still adjust status ( obtain their green card ) , in the US even if they are out of status , worked without authorization , or do not have the benefit of Section 245(i) . If a person is eligible to adjust status in the US , they should not even think of departing the US , and , therefore , trigger the 3/10 year bar . See an attorney , who can determine if you even need to depart the US to obtain your green card . Maybe you do n't need to . <p> 8 . Are there any people who could benefit from this proposed " provisional waiver " process ? There are still a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ status in the US , even if petitioned by a US citizen as an immediate relative . These include : ( a ) crewman ( jump ship ) without Section 245(i) ; ( b ) someone who entered the US without inspection ( EWI ) , such as snuck across the border , and does not have the benefit of Section 245(i) ; ( c ) a person who entered the US on a K-1 fianc ? e visa , but did not marry the American who filed the K-1 petition , but married a different American instead , and the like . So this regulation could possibly benefit them , if they have no other immigration violations , such as fraud , misrepresentation , etc . <p> In conclusion , if you think this proposed expansion of the provisional waiver could benefit you , you should definitely seek the advice of a reputable attorney , who can evaluate your circumstances and status , and determine if it is even necessary for you to depart the US , and if so , can assist in preparing and processing this provisional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be eligible for this provisional waiver . 
@@3480232 <h> Libyan symbol of freedom now facing years behind bars <h> The court ordered Eman al-Obeidi to seek counseling for mental health issues , to get help for alcohol abuse . <p> ( CNN ) -- On a February evening last year , a Libyan woman confronted two patrons at the Bohemian Biergarten in downtown Boulder , Colorado . She poured her beer on one of the customers and later threw a glass at the other , leaving a bloody gash serious enough for sutures . <p> Boulder police arrested the Libyan woman on a second-degree assault charge . It was not her first scuffle with the law in America . She 'd been arrested three times before for disorderly conduct , resisting arrest and assault . <p> She 'd had brushes with authorities in her homeland as well . But back then , in Moammar Gadhafi 's Libya , she was the victim , not the aggressor . <p> Eman al-Obeidi burst into Tripoli 's Rixos Hotel on the morning of March 26 , 2011 , six weeks after a Libyan uprising against Gadhafi erupted in the eastern city of Benghazi . She howled in front of foreign journalists staying at the hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleaded for help . <p> " Look at what Gadhafi 's men did to me , " she cried . <p> The images of al-Obeidi were seen instantly around the world .

She defied an iron-fisted dictator and in doing so , she became for a moment , however fleeting , the face of revolution . <p> More than four years later , al-Obeidi is just another inmate in the Boulder County Jail . Now she is the one branded as the aggressor . <p> She has been confined to a small cinder-block cell since January on $40,000 bond after violating the terms of a work-release program on an earlier charge . At her trial for the Biergarten assault , al-Obeidi claimed self-defense . The jury did not believe her , and she was found guilty in May . <p> In September , she will find out her punishment for the barroom brawl . It 's a Class 4 felony that carries a maximum sentence of 16 years .

He says he is uncertain whether she arrived in America without the coping mechanisms needed to resettle or whether she was never the person of fortitude the world thought they knew . <p> It 's sad , he says , that she escaped Gadhafi 's tentacles in Libya but got tangled in her own web in America . <h> Vanishing dreams <p> It 's difficult to know the whole story of al-Obeidi 's fall from emblem of freedom to a convict behind bars . <p> Her presence in the media caught the attention of global players , among them then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , who eventually arranged for asylum in the United States . <p> Even though al-Obeidi expressed gratitude in the past for the role CNN played in publicizing her case , she refused recent requests for an interview . The woman who sought out the media and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avoid the headlines . <p> Few of the people who helped al-Obeidi settle in Colorado when she first arrived as a political refugee in 2011 are still in touch with her . Some describe her as a deeply troubled woman who has displayed public flashes of anger and behaved irrationally . Even the Libyan Embassy in Washington , which provided her with a life-saving , $1,800-a-month stipend , no longer maintains contact . <p> Mevlani says his agency tried to help her attain independence and self-sufficiency in her new homeland . That adjustment is never easy , especially for those who have experienced trauma and are not well-versed in English and the culture of the United States . <p> When I visited al-Obeidi in Colorado in early 2012 , she said she felt tired . She told me she had been harassed and hurt by people , especially in Libya and the Arab world , who did not believe she had been abducted , beaten and gang-raped by thugs . <p> The following year , feminist Germaine Greer mentioned al-Obeidi in a CNN commentary on rape , lamenting that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake was to survive . Because she did not die for other people 's crimes , the offenses against her are now described as ' alleged . ' Her credibility is shot , " Greer wrote . <p> Now even those who have supported al-Obeidi may question her credibility . And dreams for her new life in the United States -- finishing college , earning a decent salary and starting her own family -- seem destined to remain just that : dreams . <p> Phone calls to people whose lives intersected with hers more recently in Colorado were not returned . Her former lawyers did not want to speak on the record . <p> The prosecutor 's office showed her leniency with her previous violations , dismissing the first case against her . The second case -- a second-degree assault on a police officer -- was reduced to a misdemeanor . <p> " No one was injured , and the district attorney 's office again showed her some measure of compassion and leniency given what she claimed to be her circumstances , " Deputy District Attorney Jonathon Martin says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> The court ordered al-Obeidi to seek counseling for mental health issues , to get help for alcohol abuse . But even before her legal woes began , she had rejected offers for counseling . <p> " We gave her the opportunity to deal with those issues rather than be incarcerated , " Martin says . " We supported the court sentencing her to treatment options . " <p> But now , he says , she faces serious felony charges in the Biergarten case " with two victims who suffered significant injuries . " <p> This time , al-Obeidi may not be so lucky . <p> Depending on her sentence , she may leave county jail and enter a state system teeming with the worst of society . <h> Traumatized and entitled ? <p> It was n't supposed to be this way for al-Obeidi . She arrived in America a few months before Gadhafi 's grisly demise gave way to a new Libya taking root . She thought that she , like her homeland , would begin again . But like Libya , al-Obeidi struggled to reconcile past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment in Denver with the promise of a better life . But her journey had been riddled with difficulties , and her time in America would prove to be no different . <p> While she was still in Libya , she had spoken openly about her abuse . In a 2011 CNN interview , she wore traditional dress , her head covered in black . Her voice quivered as she described unspeakable acts of rape and torture by 15 of Gadhafi 's henchmen . They beat her , she said . They urinated on her and blinded her with alcohol before taking turns violating her . <p> Libyan government representatives said al-Obeidi was a prostitute , a thief and a drunk . They said she was mentally ill . <p> Al-Obeidi insisted she was telling the truth . She spoke out , she said , because she wanted the world to know the reality of Libya . <p> " They just know how to lie , " she said of the Libyan government . <p> She told the world her life was in danger and made a plea to human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flee Libya and temporarily found haven in Qatar but was then deported back to Libya . She was shuttled out in June 2011 and granted asylum in the United States after Hillary Clinton intervened on her behalf . ( Repeated emails and calls to the Clinton campaign for this story were not returned . ) <p> In Denver , al-Obeidi could not get accustomed to the life of a refugee . <p> From the resettlement agency , she received an assistance check every month for $335 and a $142 debit card for food . <p> " What ? " she said . " This is not enough . " <p> When I saw her in Colorado , she admitted she did n't expect things to be this difficult in America . <p> " There is nothing easy ; you have to work , " she told me . <p> But Mevlani , the refugee agency director , said al-Obeidi did not show up for job interviews the agency arranged . She was impatient and often stormed out of meetings with people when things did not go her way . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no privacy and was worried the refugee agency staff would have access to her psychological files . And she stopped speaking about the rape she alleged . <p> Mevlani said he wanted to help . He has seen people who suffered all sorts of tragedy but al-Obeidi was particularly difficult . He felt it went beyond the trauma , beyond the harrowing circumstances she had escaped . <p> " There 's always something going on . She expects things . She has a sense of entitlement , " Mevlani said . <p> Her caseworker at the time felt she expected to be treated like a queen , especially after Clinton 's support . <p> Al-Obeidi moved to Boulder with the intention of enrolling at the University of Colorado . Mevlani says he tried to stay in touch with her but she changed her phone number . <p> The last time she came to his office , he says , he told her : " If there is anything you need , I am here to help .

In his estimation , the city is fairly wealthy and white , and al-Obeidi may have felt like an outsider . She began using an alias , Eman Ali . <p> Al-Obeidi 's legal woes started adding up , and in November she was arrested for the fourth time in two years . She tested positive for alcohol and drugs and missed court-ordered drug tests . <p> " She has some serious issues with substance abuse , " Deputy District Attorney Catrina Weigel said in court , according to the Daily Camera newspaper in Boulder .

@@3480237 @ @ @ @ <p> IN A country where sports is a prominent aspect of culture , dribbling a ball across a court or scoring goals on a grassy field has become second nature to the Filipino people . With athletics on the local and international scale being a huge source of entertainment for most , sports have given our country an identity and common ground , uniting players and fans across islands with a mutual respect for these games . This is evidenced by phenomena such as packed crowds at the Araneta Coliseum , the spread of " Azkal fever " with the rise of the men 's national football team , and the infinite number of makeshift hoops set up in every nook and cranny of every barangay . This love for the thrill of competition is testament to the undeniable truth of a modern sports proverb : In the Philippines , ball is indeed life . However , in recent years , a new game has emerged on Philippine soil , bringing with it the idea that disc can be life , too . <p> Since its first appearance in the country on the fields of San Lorenzo Park at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tremendous geographical and social expansion . The universal code espoused by the sport called the " Spirit of the Game " has transformed a group of foreigners having fun with a plastic disc into a community of over 5,000 players in more than 60 active teams dispersed throughout the 7,107 islands of the Philippines . Within a decade , small gatherings of fanatics in Makati playing a game without referees swelled into large-scale recreational tournaments that invited both local and foreign clubs to dish it out on the field . <p> The establishment of a governing body called the Philippine Ultimate Association soon followed in 2003 to oversee and sanction all official activity with a disc , sparking the creation and maintenance of an Ultimate image and identity through international representation . And while the world-renowned Boracay Dragons have expertly carried the hopes and dreams of the nation on their shoulders by defending their reputation as the kings of beach ultimate on the world stage , the Philippines has demonstrated that it is capable of holding its own on the grass as well . This was the challenge four Atenean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Championship ( WU23UC ) held in London from July 12 to 18 . <p> Ateneans represent on the world stage <p> Information design sophomore Angela Titular , management economics sophomore Gerard Di ? o , communications supersenior Anjo Umali , and Anj Nguyen ( AB COM ' 15 ) represented the country as members of the national squad that participated in the WU23UC , a week-long international tournament that pitted the youth teams of the strongest nations in the world against each other in contention for the ultimate prize in Open , Mixed , and Women 's Divisions . The biennial tournament this year saw the cr ? me dela cr ? me of the Ultimate Frisbee world test their mettle on the world stage as 17 nations from six different continents took to the British fields and skies in a competitive display of sportsmanship and spirit . <p> The Philippine delegation was composed primarily of the most skilled stalwarts from different teams around Metro Manila and a few other talents outside the reach of the metropolis . It was comprised of two teams meant to compete in the Open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five-day pool play but eventually failing to qualify for the play-offs that were dominated by North American squads in each division . <p> " The competition we faced in London was like nothing we 've ever faced before , " shares Di ? o . " In a tournament like this , we faced players who are considered to be the best of our age in their countries , while some players are even part of the professional league in the United States . So simply put , these were elite level players who are at the peak of the Ultimate Frisbee level in the U23 age bracket . " <p> In addition to the surreal level of skill the squad was facing in London , a few other setbacks that transcended the white lines of the field made life much more difficult for the team on British soil . Shorter training times and drastic differences in temperature and weather were key factors that worked against the Philippine team . <p> " Another problem was experience as individuals and as a team , " explains Nguyen . " Teams like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had three months to train together . We also faced harsh weather since it would get really cold and windy and it would rain for awhile and stop , so we 'd be left soaked and shivering . " <p> But perhaps the most anticipated complication was the team 's vertical disadvantage against taller sides , an age-old story in the realm of Philippine athletics . " Except for the Asian teams , all the other teams were towering over our guys and girls . I almost felt short , and I 'm 5 ' 9 " ! " says Nguyen . <p> Despite the disappointment , defeat could hardly dampen the spirits of the Filipino team . The experience of representing one 's country and being able to play with and against athletes who share the same love for the sport was much more valuable than any success on the scoreboard . Failure can do little to bring an athlete down in the sport of Ultimate Frisbee , where the values of teamwork , discipline , patience , and camaraderie come before victory . <p> " The competition was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " comments Titular . " Being able to compete against foreign teams teaches you how to adapt to their different styles of play , to maybe even bring home and master . " <p> A share in the spotlight <p> The Philippine team brought home much more than a few mere victories tucked under their belt . The fire of Ultimate Frisbee in the country burns brighter with the squad returning as heroes who have accomplished much for the sport by opening the eyes of the public to an up and coming game . Besides growing as individual athletes , the journey to London has promoted the sport a hundredfold in the Philippines by giving it a boost in a crucial area that has greatly hindered its growth -- publicity . <p> The lack of attention and funding in the game has long kept Ultimate Frisbee from attaining the level of a national sport despite its ever-growing popularity . Although basketball and football will not likely be unseated from the throne , it would be a shame for Ultimate to be cast in shadow forever when it has , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the efforts of an enormous community of fans and players . <p> Ultimate Frisbee is growing rapidly with competition spreading from school to school through tournaments like the Philippine Ultimate Little League and the National Ultimate Collegiate Championship ( NUCC ) . With the game sharing the same humble beginnings as many of the country 's most popular sports , it is only a matter of time before it achieves the same status and level of popularity , perhaps even becoming a UAAP sport in the near future -- a vision about which the national team players are hopeful . <p> " Ultimate promotes a lot of good things such as teamwork , discipline , strategy , patience , and spirit of the game , " says Titular . " Because of that , I see Ultimate Frisbee growing more and more in the country . It really is a great sport to play and to be a part of . " <p> Di ? o shares similar sentiments . " As for Ultimate in Ateneo , I hope that the WU23UC will inspire both new and older players to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another to become better players , " he says . He also envisions having more clinics around the country wherein new players can learn the sport from Ultimate coaches and veterans . <p> For now , the life of Ultimate Frisbee on campus takes form in the Ateneo Frisbee Organization , an unaccredited student organization that represents the school in the annual NUCC . They finished first runner-up behind the University of the Philippines Diliman at this year 's tournament -- a milestone in the team 's history and a definite leap forward to further the sport in the school . <p> Participation in the WU23UC was a necessary step in pushing for a more prosperous future for Ultimate Frisbee in the Philippines -- a course of action that produced positive results by garnering public interest in the sport and one that is definitely going to take Ultimate Frisbee soaring to greater heights .

The political space in Cambodia is greater now than ever before , and that is a good thing . <p> That said , there is still cause for concern that could potentially become setbacks to the evolution of Cambodia 's democracy or reverse the gains made . The recent arrests of CNRP activists and the law on NGOs are such examples . It is a fact , however , that the average Cambodian citizen is increasingly aware of the importance of full political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people are pushing their elected leaders for reform through democratic means . It bears repeating that true reform can help Cambodia achieve its full potential and not let its past dictate its future . <p> 2 . What have been your top priorities as Ambassador , and do you believe that your successor will continue this work ? <p> During my time as Ambassador , I focused on promoting key U.S. interests in Cambodia , including human rights , sustainable development , business and trade , as well as providing assistance to American citizens . Speaking in broad terms , we have tried to focus our programs on improving the daily life of the average Cambodian . Just in the past decade or so , Cambodia has seen its poverty rate slashed by two-thirds , infant mortality reduced by 70 percent , youth literacy expanded by 15 percent , and life expectancy has increased by 10 years . These are great signs of progress to build upon but more work lies ahead . With regards to the country 's economic progress , we have actively worked to promote a positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and open for business . In terms of development , my primary emphasis has been on programs and initiatives that directly benefit the Cambodian citizens , now and in the future . I am proud of the efforts we have made to help in sectors ranging from agriculture to education , security to health , the environment to the economy , and much more . <p> In fiscal year 2014 alone , the United States provided $105 million in assistance to Cambodia , primarily through the U.S. Agency for International Development ( USAID ) . The results have been remarkable . For instance , through the President 's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief ( PEPFAR ) , the United States helped cut Cambodia 's HIV prevalence in half and continues to provide treatment to over 80 percent of those living with HIV/AIDS . We have assisted 120,000 farmers around the Tonle Sap increase yields by 344 percent . We helped over 36,000 Cambodian stakeholders adapt to the effects of climate change . <p> My successor , William Heidt , is going to be a wonderful Ambassador . He is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and overseas , including here in Cambodia in the late 1990 's . The new Ambassador will set his own priorities , of course , but I expect that the United States will continue to work with the people and government of Cambodia to help create a more stable , prosperous , and democratic society . <p> 3 . The government criticized you on several occasions for interfering in Cambodia 's internal affairs . Do you think that this was fair ? <p> We fully respect Cambodia 's sovereignty . The United States is a friend of Cambodia , and as friends we will not hesitate to speak out on issues of importance to our country , including human rights . We have to be true to our principles , just as Cambodia has to be true to its principles . The important thing is that we have been able to establish an open dialogue on a wide range of subjects , and although we sometimes disagree we are able to talk about it with candor and in a spirit of cooperation and friendship . I emphasized the importance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hun Sen earlier this week . <p> 4 . What was the most exciting moment during your time as Ambassador ? Are there one or two events that stick out in your mind ? <p> The period starting with the 2013 election through the deal that resolved the political impasse was a remarkable time to be in Cambodia . It was a period of great tension , but also one of great opportunity . I was delighted to see civil society and ordinary Cambodians working together to advance the cause of democracy . <p> I will also remember the many historic visits that we received from high-level officials , including President Obama 's participation in the 2012 East Asia Summit , First Lady Michelle Obama 's trip to Siem Reap in March , and two visits from Secretary of State Hillary Clinton . These and other visits demonstrate that Cambodia is an important partner for the United States in Southeast Asia . <p> Lastly , I think that the opening of Aeon Mall in Phnom Penh was exciting because it shows Cambodia has made significant economic progress and that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing about even more exciting developments in the future . <p> 5 . In Cambodia , the median age of the population is 24 years . You have devoted a lot of time to getting to know young Cambodians . What changes will this youth surge bring to Cambodian politics and society ? <p> Without a doubt young Cambodians are poised to play an increasingly important role in Cambodian politics , economics , and society . We are already seeing young people speak out on issues that are important to them . This nation 's " youth bulge " is one of its great advantages , and ensuring that young people are educated and have opportunity is the best investment that Cambodia can make in its long-term future . Young people bring energy and fresh ideas to problems , and Cambodia 's leaders would be wise to listen to what they have to say . The U.S. government is working hard to harness this energy and enthusiasm through programs like the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative ( YSEALI ) -- President Obama 's signature initiative to engage with the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite memories involves spending time exchanging ideas with my youth council . I have been inspired by them more than they know . <p> Young Cambodians are making excellent use of social media , which has exploded in the past three years . When I arrived in Cambodia , the U.S. Embassy had 25,000 Facebook fans . Today , a little more than three years later , we have more than 600,000 . Without a doubt , social media is a powerful tool for young Cambodians to learn about the world and to make a difference at home . <p> 6 . What will you miss the most from Cambodia ? And what will you miss the least ? <p> I will miss so many things about this country : the food , the cultural heritage , the natural beauty . But most of all , I will miss the genuine warmth of the Cambodian people . I have traveled all across the world , but I can say without a doubt that Cambodians are the most friendly , welcoming people that I have ever met . <p> One thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Penh . It was bad when I arrived , and it 's even worse now . As Phnom Penh continues to grow and expand , urban planning must become more of a priority . <p> 7 . Do you have any parting words ? <p> It was truly and honor and pleasure to serve as the U.S. Ambassador to the Kingdom of Cambodia . I take with me many memories of the people that I met and the places I went , and I hope that I have helped to improve relations between our two countries and to make a positive difference the people of Cambodia . <p> I am and always will be a friend to Cambodia . I leave with a heavy heart , but with a profound sense of hope and optimism for the future of this great nation .

As a safety measure , the Cambodian government has requested that Qatar guarantee safe worksites for laborers . <p> Almost six months later , Qatar still has n't guaranteed worker safety . <p> The wait may almost be over , though , as the Qatari government is expected to soon confirm that worksite security standards are up to standard , said Heng Sour , the spokesman for the Ministry of Labor . This would allow Cambodian workers -- some of whom tested with recruitment agencies in May -- to begin working in Qatar .

Long hours working in extreme heat can cause workers to succumb to fatal heat strokes . <p> Other workers are reportedly victims of violence and sexual abuse , and according to the kafala system , workers can not leave Qatar , even for work or a holiday , without their employers ' permission .

" <p> The Long Wait <p> Meanwhile , workers who trained and tested their skills at a recruitment agency in the hopes of getting a job building the next World Cup stadium are in limbo , unsure when or if they will be allowed to go to work . <p> Almost 100 workers have already been tested at the KCTC recruiting agency , which the government permitted to start recruiting for jobs in the Gulf emirate in May .

The recruitment firm said it has construction firms in Qatar who are eager to hire their workers . The only barrier that remains is the confirmation of safe working conditions from Doha . <p> The Qatar Ministry of Labor could not be reached for comment on the pending deal with the Cambodian government . <p> Opportunity or Exploitation ? <p> " We want to open up the market for Cambodian workers , " said Mr. Sour , of the Ministry of Labor .

@@3562239 <p> A MINI Cooper S is one of those cars we all need to own at one point in our lives . <p> The new MINI Cooper S is n't so MINI anymore . Indeed it still falls within the small car category , but it feels like it went to the gym , became a cross-fit addict and now the skin it wears can barely contain its added size , girth and heft . <p> It 's 98 mm longer , 44 mm wider and 7 mm taller . This is a good thing though , because it makes the new MINI platform just so much more easier to drive everyday , with more useful space inside and the longer wheelbase means it hops , jumps and shunts so much more less , making it less tiring to drive when you 're not in the mood , and a better , more capable high-speed long-distance tourer . Makes for a perfect getaway car for a romantic weekend for two , and a few small bags at the back . <p> It 's quite safe too : the Cooper S comes with eight airbags as standard , ABS-EBD brakes with brake assist , traction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan to probe the limits of the MINI because despite being a cute little car , it 's also got the ferocity of a monster if you do n't respect it . <p> Tourer . That 's an interesting word , because the new MINI is underpinned with the new modular platform being adopted by its parent BMW . This new modular platform will underpin more BMW variants in the future , with the BMW 2-Series Active Tourer being the first front-wheel drive bearing the BMW roundel . <p> But has the added size and heft changed the MINI 's go-kart like characteristics ? Thankfully no . Power comes from a 2.0 liter BMW TwinPower twin-scroll turbocharged direct-injected petrol engine that delivers a sizeable 189 hp and 280 Newton meters of torque driving the front wheels via a six-speed automatic with paddle shifters behind the steering wheel . The suspension utilizes a front Macpherson-strut design for better packaging , while the rear utilizes a more sophisticated multi-link rear-suspension . The multi-link rear is also the reason why there 's minimal trunk space and the rear seats are tight ; tighter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seating position is perfect , and the seats have a great balance of comfort and support even on very long drives and on very aggressive , sporty , manic track-driving . Kudos to MINI for finding such a great driving position . <p> The suspension is firm , and even without run-flat tires , it 's still firm . This is good for high-speed highway driving , where the MINI feels like it was designed with a lot of Autobahn miles in mind ( the A90 through A99 Autobahn routes are some of the smoothest in all of Germany , leading into and out of Bavaria , BMW-MINI 's home ) . <p> But on curvy , bumpy , undulating , winding roads , it can give you a bit of a fright : the suspension does n't have enough droop at times when you hit a sharp crest , there 's a slight lack of compliance when cornering hard on less than baby-bottom smooth roads , which can get the tail slightly nervous , and large expansion joints unsettle the MINI quite a bit . Or perhaps this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large 365 mm steering wheel ensures that you have adequate leverage to snap in a bit of opposite or just corrective lock when needed . Doing so becomes second nature as the steering feels intuitive , accurate and brimming with feel . <p> The rest goes for the suspension and controls : the suspension , though firm loads up nicely on high-speed sweepers , and once you get used to the somewhat lively rear-end , you know how much allowance you need to give the MINI 's rear end . The brakes were mushy on our test unit , but nothing that a fluid bleed wo n't fix . They were strong , fade-free and confident to boot . <p> We drove the MINI Cooper S down the booming south , through Laguna , parts of Cavite and of course Metro Manila .

Few cars in this price range deliver the smiles per gallon , and while others will argue that a rally-replica like a Mitsubishi Evo or Subaru STI can deliver even greater performance at a cheaper price in a comparable package , none have the excellent build quality , storied past and sense of occasion which the MINI has in spades . The MINI also has far better interior materials used , and the large central LCD instrument cluster displays all the information you 'll ever need to know about : multi-media , vehicle system settings , drive mode and so on .

Fuel consumption was a decent combined 9 km per liter on an engine with only a handful of miles in it , so this should improve vastly . The added size has made it easier to live with as well , and yet the fun-factor is very much intact . <p> And if you needed even more reason to buy one now , MINI Philippines is offering every MINI buyer until the end of September to go to MINI 's Oxford plant in the UK in November this year to see them in their final production phase prior to rolling out and into a new adventure with their respective owner .

@@3564233 <h> Top five features of the 2015 Ford Everest <p> The Everest takes on tough trails with an electronic locking rear differential . <p> Customers who pre-ordered the 2015 Ford Everest do n't have to wait much longer as Ford Philippines begins their delivery of the eagerly-awaited units this month . And judging by the length of the waiting list , we 're going to see a whole lot of them on the road as the months go along . <p> Whether you 're a brand new owner looking to learn more about Ford 's new baby , or someone in the market for a seven-seater SUV , here are some reasons why we think the 2015 Ford Everest is a big game changer for its segment . <p> WATT 'S LINKAGE <p> Watt 's Linkage <p> The Ford Everest 's solid rear axle features what 's called a Watt 's linkage -- an alternative to the more common suspension link known as a Panhard rod . When a vehicle equipped with a Panhard rod starts to steer , the amount of body roll is greater than if it turns the other direction . This is a kind of asymmetry that automotive engineers usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more symmetrical steering behavior and significantly reduces the side-to-side movement of the axle 's vertical travel . Simply put : better handling and more agile steering characteristics . <p> NOISE CANCELLATION <p> Active noise cancellation in the cabin <p> Ford 's engineers have put a tremendous amount of effort in creating aremarkably quiet cabin . The beauty is in the small details . One such example is aerodynamic sails on the side mirrors that are designed to reduce wind noise by 10 dB when driving with the windows down . Ford has used sound deadening materials in the door , roof and body . All doors also feature a double sealing system which reduces sound leaks and wind whistles . <p> But perhaps the most innovative technology involved in the Everest 's quiet drive is Active Noise Cancellation , which uses three highly sensitive microphones installed over the first and third row seats . <p> It 's a technique similarly used in noise cancelling headphones , with the microphones sending signals to the Active Noise Cancellation control module , and the module instantaneously generating opposing sound waves in real time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speakers , cancelling out any unwanted noise within the range of 30-180Hz . <p> HIGH-PRESSURE DIRECT INJECTION <p> The 2.2-liter Duratorq with high-pressure direct injection <p> The fuel injection system of Ford 's new Duratorq engine operates at 1800 bar and uses a new cone angle , more injection holes and a higher fuel-flow rate than the previous iteration . The Everest uses Piezo fuel injectors which are considered to be more accurate than solid injectors . They open and close much faster than conventional injectors , allowing for precise control of the injection interval , which determines how much fuel is sprayed into the engine . This results in a clean and complete combustion process which achieves a lot of power and torque with reduced fuel consumption and cleaner emissions . <p> IMPROVED TRANSMISSIONS <p> The Terrain Management System uses presets to conquer all . <p> Manual transmissions have a Crank-in-Gear feature that allows you to restart a stalled Everest in low-range four-wheel drive without using the clutch pedal . The Everest 's automatic transmission is fully adaptive , tailoring its shifting behavior to your driving style at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ input , as well as cornering speed to make sure it 's always at the right gear at the right time . It does this by recording and accumulating " points " . The more enthusiastically you drive ( rapid acceleration / high-speed cornering ) , the more points are acknowledged by the system . A fuel-economy biased shifting pattern starts at the base 0 points , a sportier shifting patter is 100 points , and the " enthusiast " shifting behavior is at 200 points . The software decreases the points once it detects that your driving style has become less sporty . <p> ELECTRONIC REAR DIFFERENTIAL <p> The electronic locking rear differential ( which can be locked manually ) comes in handy when you 're unsure about the composition of the terrain you 're about to traverse . It locks the axle so that power is sent to both rear wheels , allowing them to turn together . This is helpful if one wheel is in the air , since full axle drive torque is sent to the wheel that has grip . Four different terrain settings determine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throttle sensitivity , namely , Snow/Mud/Grass , Sand , Rock and Low-Range . When in low range , the Everest 's speed is limited to 65 km/h.

Rappler comes from the root words " rap " ( to discuss ) + " ripple " ( to make waves ) . <h> The political hazing of Grace Poe <p> In retrospect , Senator Grace Poe will be grateful about the events in the month of August . <p> In particular , the filing of the disqualification case against her by Rizalino David and her blunder in her response to the Iglesia ni Cristo protest against Justice Secretary Leila de Lima unexpectedly tested her at an early stage of the presidential campaign . Even as she has not yet declared , Senator Poe has been subjected to criticism , hatred and vitriol . Her patriotism has been questioned ; even her husband and children 's love for our country has been attacked . <p> Indeed , in August , Senator Poe suffered the equivalent of political hazing . <p> If she survived that month with her character intact , and most importantly with her family strong and united , she would now be ready for prime time . If she decides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially her young daughters , I would respect that . One should never sacrifice family ever even for a good cause . If Senator Poe however chose not to run , I would consider that a big loss for the country . We need good options for 2016 and she , alongside Mayor Rudy Duterte , would present an alternative to the two big anti-change and anti-reform establishment parties . While I am not ready to endorse her now or even to vote for her , I would like the option of doing that in May 2016 . <p> It is imperative that Grace Poe 's campaign learns from the INC fiasco . It was not that she said the wrong thing ; indeed , we have to respect everyone 's rights and especially on the exercise of religion . <p> What was incomplete in her statement is that she did not support Justice Secretary de Lima 's action of investigating a criminal complaint properly filed in the Department of Justice . By remaining silent on that , Senator Poe appeared to be siding with INC for political reasons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to be her vice-presidential candidate , went all the way to support the INC by saying that Secretary de Lima should prioritize other investigations and leave INC alone with their internal problems . People conflated Escudero 's statement with Poe 's and concluded they are both pro-INC and are willing to openly disregard the rule of law for the sake of getting the group 's vote . <p> The truth is only Duterte got it right ; ironically it was the archenemy of de Lima who supported her while Binay went on record also to fully support INC and Roxas was balanced in asking INC to respect of the rights of others affected by the protest . The mitigating circumstance in the case of Poe , lost in the noise that followed her remarks , was that her statement was given in an ambush interview compounded further by an error committed by a campaign volunteer . <p> The clear lesson here is for Senator Poe and her staff to be very disciplined from now on . No ambush interviews especially when there is a controversy ; she should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her staff must always be monitoring social media to warn her of the mood of people ; and of course , no longer must it happen that an ordinary volunteer can upload critical material without clearance from the senior communications people in the campaign . <p> Elephant in the room <p> There is another thing that Senator Poe must do . <p> Aside from the legal issues on citizenship and residence that she must face , there is another elephant in the room in Poe 's campaign and that is Senator Escudero . Now , let me be clear : I believe Senator Escudero is the right choice as VP for Poe . They are good friends , they are compatible , and they trust each other . This is a recipe for a good partnership . <p> Personally , my experience with Senator Escudero has always been positive , with him always being respectful of this simple professor ( although I never taught him , I suspect my being a UP Law professor has earned me that treatment from this powerful politician ) . Nonetheless , it is clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Poe and Escudero campaigns , with the latter subordinate to the former . <p> The truth is that Senator Escudero is not popular with some quarters that believe him to be a traditional politician , as a traitor ( in the 2010 elections when he engineered the NoyBi campaign ) , and even as corrupt . To these quarters , Senator Poe is tainted by the association with Escudero and the experience with the INC controversy is positive proof of how Poe is just the puppet of her best friend in the Senate . <p> Having observed the steeliness and strong will of Senator Poe , I do not believe that she is a puppet of Escudero , but perception in politics is sometimes more important than reality . And definitely the perception is there and it will be hard for that to disappear unless the Poe campaign takes serious and visible steps to distance itself from the Escudero VP campaign . <p> The truth is that the presidential and vice-presidential elections are different elections . People cross over all the time and mix their votes . This will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , be coordination between the two campaigns with Escudero 's subordinate to Poe 's . In practice , that means Senator Poe must always be taking the lead on policy statements and Senator Escudero must always wait until the latter has spoken before he weighs in to support her . <p> Get more advisers <p> An important element of this distancing is that Senator Poe must widen her circle of advisers and not rely just on Senator Escudero 's views as sound as they must be . <p> Senator Poe 's response to the INC crisis made her sound like a traditional politician . She lost some votes because of that , some of which she will not be able to regain while others can be persuaded to return to her fold . She must now work hard to do that , and especially focus her efforts on the millennials who will be the majority of voters in next year 's elections . <p> Among the declared and potential candidates , as we saw in her Nueva Ecija and Pangasinan stints , Senator Poe is the only one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly has a big advantage over her rivals . But it would be a mistake to talk down to these young voters . She must inspire them and call on them to be excellent for the country . <p> But to do that , Senator Poe must be excellent herself and abandon the ways of the traditional , wheeling-dealing , and insincere traditional poltician . <p> The political hazing of Grace Poe came at a good time . It is my hope that her initiation into presidential politics did not embitter or destroy her . What does not kill you makes you stronger , as the saying goes .

All photos provided by Oz Mendoza <p> This September , Miagao celebrated another Hablon Festival . The thought of it inspires in me a yearning to see Miagao again . On a visit last year , I fell in love with the charming Iloilo town , and I 've always told myself I 'd return . ( READ : Iloilo City : Your complete weekend itinerary ) <p> I 've encountered many rural townships on my travels around the Philippines , hidden jewels such as Calubian , Leyte or New Israel , North Cotabato . Each place is wonderful in its own way . For me , Miagao is just a bit more special , for beyond the quiet facade , it has unexpected , eclectic delights to offer . ( READ : #SharePH #ShareIloilo : Islas de Gigantes , Miag-ao church , Cami ? a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year ago , during their Salakayan Festival . The town 's biggest festival , Salakayan takes its name from a word that means " to attack . " Its highlight is the colorful re-enactment of a historic 1754 battle between the townsfolk and Moro raiders . <p> I remember it well . A crowd had gathered on the street alongside cherished local landmark Miagao Church , waiting for the show to begin . One by one , troupes of costumed dancers marched out under the blazing sun . Young women twirled billowy skirts , waving palm leaves and floral wreaths . <p> The dance picked up again , now a showcase of pride and resilience , as new backdrops feted the building of the present church . <p> Glittering spectacle <p> I was captivated by the drama of the battle , but looking back , I see that the showcase works as the origin fable of the town church . Sto Tomas de Villanueva Parish Church , better known as Miagao Church , is a marvel of Baroque architecture . <p> Its most striking feature is the intricate bas relief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its leaves outspread , and St. Christopher bearing the Child Jesus . Wonderfully ornate designs frame the arched windows , and also fringe the gold-plated retablo behind the altar . <p> The church is what put Miagao on the map . It 's a gorgeous historical building and a UNESCO World Heritage Site . Travelers come from all over to admire it . Many of them do n't think to explore the town much further . Neither did I , the very first time I went there . Only on my second visit ( to see the festival ) did I get to know the town a great deal better . <p> I came away from that visit with the picture of a Miagao composed of varied , almost contrasting shades . On the one hand , it truly is a small town , with every bit the character you would expect of one . The locals are warm and hospitable , making outsiders feel like honored guests , taking pains to see that they 're well cared for -- and well fed . And even though everyone 's toting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's an era with roots still in the past -- in a good way . <p> As if I had n't already been convinced , the Queen of Miagao coronation night proved a stunning showcase of the town 's charm .

All of the candidates were bedecked in fairytale gowns , each girl evoking Cinderella at the ball . <p> The Queen of Miagao paraded to the stage while her attendants doled out a staggering length of train that stretched all the way across the ballroom floor . To my eyes , the night went by in bizarre spectacle -- yet I was enraptured and amazed , all the same . What a great show it was , seriously . <p> A university town 's charms <p> There are other sides to Miagao , too . For one thing , it 's a university town , home to a component campus of the University of the Philippines Visayas ( UPV ) .

Past it , I emerged into the dining area , a wonderland of art , pottery , and assorted bric-a-brac . <p> Despite the eccentric hodgepodge , there was a sense of harmony to the place . We relaxed , had coffee , and browsed the motley collection -- the Buddhist statues , the equine sculptures , the golden pillar , even the bone segments from the spine of a whale shark . <p> From St. Michael 's , we began a walk towards the university 's Museum of Natural Sciences .

The magnificent sculpture was created by the National Artist Napoleon Abueva . <p> We then walked to the beach area . Imagine , a university that has its own beach ! It 's a black sand beach , and low on frills . Still , it 's nifty , is n't it ? A gate bars students from direct access to the beach . However , it was a holiday , and we were allowed to go down and stroll on the sands . The beach was n't too pretty , but it was clean , and the sea looked inviting .

@@3619237 <p> Statement of the Institute for Autonomy and Governance ( IAG ) on the Legislation of the Basic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region ( H.B. 5811 and S.B. 2894 ) <p> The Institute for Autonomy and Governance ( IAG ) , an independent public policy center devoted to the development of autonomy and good governance for Mindanao peace , makes public our analysis and recommendations on the pending legislation of the Basic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in the House of Representatives ( HB 5811 ) and the Senate ( SB 2894 ) . Our position is informed by countless experts ' discussions , researches and consultations we have undertaken on Muslim Mindanao autonomy since IAG began its work in 2001 . <p> Four ( 4 ) Key Considerations <p> First , peace agreements between the Philippine government and the Moro revolutionary fronts from the Tripoli Agreement in 1976 , Final Peace Agreement in 1996 to the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro ( CAB ) in 2014 are good roadmaps for the evolving development of meaningful autonomy for peace in Muslim Mindanao . Over-all , they establish and address weaknesses in autonomous arrangements . <p> The CAB , in particular , lays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delineation of powers between the national and regional government and a regional parliamentary system . It strengthens fiscal autonomy through a block grant system and a degree of control and management of the region 's natural resources . It provides a pluralistic justice system that recognizes the diverse peoples in the region and promotes law and order through normalization and policing roadmap . It mandates a system of continuing adjustments and improvement of intergovernmental relations through a multi-level grievance resolution machinery . <p> Second , at this time , the full implementation of peace agreements with the Moro fronts is not possible under the country 's prevailing constitutional , legal and political environment . The weight of legal opinion is to the effect that a number of provisions in the CAB and the proposed BBL are of doubtful legality and constitutionality . Without public support and legitimacy in the country 's laws and the constitution , the CAB and the BBL can not be implemented meaningfully and the gains and successes so far achieved are in danger of being further undermined . <p> Third , more powers and resources in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in successful autonomy . The ARMM has key powers under its Organic Law that to date are not implemented primarily because of weaknesses in the national bureaucracy to effect real devolution and the timidity and lack of capacity of the autonomous government to assert its powers as a matter of law . Among these unimplemented policies are the establishment of the regional police force , Shariah Law , regional indigenous people 's law , <p> local government system and local elections . Thus , it is absolutely essential that the transfer of powers to the autonomous government be in step with increased capacities as well as legal and bureaucratic reforms in the national and regional governments . <p> Fourth , the implementation of all peace agreements and legislation of any Basic Law must be inclusive . An autonomy arrangement " franchised " by a group or individual is bound to fail . Processes and structures moving forward must involve and supported by all key stakeholders including minority groups . It is imperative that the implementation of the CAB must seriously consider the enforcement of existing peace agreements with the Moro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BBL Legislation <p> The legislation of the BBL is effectively in a state of ' suspended animation ' . The House and the Senate , invoking their plenary powers and obligation to insure that the final version of the basic law is in accord with the Philippine constitution , have introduced substitute bills that depart in varying degrees from the proposed BBL . Senate Bill 2894 in particular is questioned as having provisions that are less than the current ARMM Organic Law . The remaining time for the passage of the Basic Law is getting limited and there is the real possibility that the national Budget Law and the 2016 election campaign will soon , sideline it . Many believe that there is no sufficient time anymore to pass a Basic Law under the Aquino administration . The MILF has publicly committed to continue the peace process and advocate for the legislation of the BBL that is compliant to the CAB beyond the current administration . <p> All parties and stakeholders must now accept the hard reality that unless the Philippine constitution is amended to accommodate the terms of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shift the country from a unitary to a federal system of government , existing peace agreements can not be fully implemented . It is the obligation of the Moro revolutionary fronts and government to move the peace process forward from a realistic and doable framework . <p> Our Call : Working Autonomy as a Framework <p> A realistic and doable framework is one that insures a working autonomy and a good transition from the ARMM to the Bangsamoro . We identify five ( 5 ) pillars of autonomy in H.B. 5811 and S.B. 2894 that are " big leaps " for autonomy in policy and practice . These are the " seeds " for the growth of meaningful Bangsamoro autonomy and self-governance in step with successful transition and legal and constitutional reforms . <p> First , we urge Congress to focus on the legislation of the five ( 5 ) pillars : <p> Delienation of powers between the national and regional Bangsamoro government ; <p> Regional Parliamentary system with an electoral system that provides equitable allocation for district and party representatives ; <p> Control of strategic resources by the Bangsamoro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regional governments ; <p> Block grant ; <p> Justice system and Bangsamoro Safety &amp; Security ; <p> These five ( 5 ) pillars are already provided for in H.B. 5811 and S.B. 2894 . The executive branch of government , the Senate and the House , the MILF and key stakeholders are strongly urged to devote all remaining energy and time to reach a consensus on the five ( 5 ) pillars above . IAG is of the view that a BLBAR with these five ( 5 ) pillars already provides a good foundation for the growth of meaningful Bangsamoro autonomy . <p> Secondly , we urge policymakers to legislate a realistic , sound and effective transition to the Bangsamoro . A successful transition can only be achieved when it results in policies , processes and structures to effectively implement the five ( 5 ) pillars . The transition must provide sufficient time , resources and mechanisms to raise the institutional and human resources capacities of the future Bangsamoro government to build and administer strong autonomous governance infrastructures . Special governmental fiscal processes must be adopted during the transition period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanisms at all levels of government . <p> It must be noted that a transitional mechanism is already provided in H.B. 5811 and S.B. 2894 . We urge Congress and key stakeholders to reconcile and develop a transition mechanism following the criteria above . <p> Concluding Remarks <p> Key stakeholders must recognize that peace agreements are aspirational and roadmap documents and the political deals therein can only be meaningfully implemented in phases and in step with reforms of national and regional political institutions , laws and processes . Political and legal reforms require more than reconfiguring the relationship between Manila and the envisioned Bangsamoro political entity . Equally and perhaps more crucial is building a democratic , efficient and working autonomous Bangsamoro political institutions that will lead the region to peace and prosperity . <p> We have a rare opportunity in the CAB , past peace agreements and in H.B. 5811 and S.B. 2894 to evolve strong public policies for Bangsamoro autonomy . The substitute bills pending in Congress may not embody all and some provisions may be contrary to what is provided for under the peace agreements . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to deal with the question of implementation of peace agreements . But from the perspective of building a strong autonomy in addressing the Bangsamoro question , the five ( 5 ) pillars already provided H.B. 5811 and S.B. 2894 when refined and strengthened are more than substantial to evolve a meaningful Moro autonomy . <p> Whether a BBL is legislated now or in the next administration , the process will be hounded and weigh down by the same constitutional , legal and political issues .

Just par for the course , since this was Ali-Frazier . <p> What follows is a round-by-round break-down of the fight based on accounts by people who actively participated in the match or watched it . <p> ROUND 1 <p> Hugh O'Brien , an American actor and guest analyst on HBO 's live coverage of the Thrilla : " Ali realizes he 's got to come out and try to do something in the first five rounds and that round proved it . He 's going at Joe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Ferdie Pacheco , Ali 's corner physician and author of the book , The 12 Greatest Rounds of Boxing : " Ali 's intention was to knock Frazier out in the first five rounds . He almost did . " <p> Eddie Futch , Joe Frazier 's trainer , in an interview on NBC 's Saturday Sports Showcase Presents The Greatest Fights Ever : " Going into the first round , we were attempting to lure Ali into throwing the uppercut at Frazier as he had done in the first fight . Our strategy then was to step in with a left hook as he threw the uppercut , and the bobbing and weaving was done in order to make Ali throw that punch . Ali did not go for it because he remembered the first fight when he got hurt on a couple of occasions doing just that . We did n't expect Ali to come out that fast . We really did n't . In the previous two fights , the pace had been more normal . " <p> Dave Wolf , sports journalist and a veteran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting low enough and he was eating a lot of Ali 's jabs . " <p> Mark Kram , Sports Illustrated journalist : " True to his plan , arrogant and contemptuous of an opponent 's worth as never before , Ali opened the fight flat-footed in the center of the ring , his hands whipping out and back like the pistons of an enormous and magnificent engine . Much broader than he has ever been , the look of swift destruction defined by his every move , Ali seemed indestructible . " <p> ROUND 2 <p> Mark Kram : " Frazier 's legs buckled two or three times in that first round , and in the second he took more lashing as Ali loaded on him all the meanness that he could find in himself . " <p> Ferdie Pacheco : " He rained blows on Joe , whose ability to take a punch had been questioned since Foreman had bounced him around like a basketball a year before in Jamaica . Now , Frazier kept coming , cannonball shots caroming of his iron jaw , and then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this and pursued him relentlessly . After Frazier had made it safely to the bell , Ali began to view him in a different light . This was n't going to be easy after all . " <p> Fight referee Carlos Padilla : " I told ( Ali ) not to hold Frazier to the back of the head and at the same time pull him . That 's Ali 's habit during fights . He was little bit surprised . He looked at me , ' Who is this guy holding me at the back of my head and warning me ? ' " <p> ROUND 3 <p> Thomas Hauser , an American author , who wrote the Ali biography , Muhammad Ali : His Life and Times : " Great fights between great fighters are few and far between . In the early rounds , Ali was dominant . He was moving , jabbing . Joe could n't get to him . In the first few rounds you said , " OK , Ali 's going to win this fight . " <p> Angelo Dundee , Muhammad Ali @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My Corner : " In the third , Ali caught Frazier with two lead lefts , jerking Frazier 's head back . But Frazier , an Energizer Bunny in boxing trunks , kept coming forward , forcing Ali into the ropes where Ali grabbed his shorter foe , pushing his head down . " <p> Ken Norton , a guest analyst on the HBO crew and one of only two men besides Frazier to beat Ali prior to the Thrilla : " Joe 's trying to pick his spots , he 's trying to get between the hands , trying to go behind the elbow and in the kidneys , which is bound to have a telling effect if the fight goes that far . " <p> Don Dunphy , a boxing broadcaster who was the anchorman who led the four-man HBO broadcast panel : " I noticed that Ali missed a lot in that round as though he was overanxious . " <p> ROUND 4 <p> Flip Wilson , an American actor and TV host , who was a guest analyst on the HBO crew : " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In the fourth or fifth round , somewhere in there , Joe hits him with a right hand . I did n't think Joe could tie his shoes with his right hand . And Ali pulls back and he says , ' You have no right hand . You ca n't do that . You ca n't do that . ' Bing . He hits him with another right hand . Suddenly , Ali had to think there were two hands in this fight on the other side . That was important . " <p> Angelo Dundee : " All of a sudden the man Muhammad had thoroughly discounted was now so alive his breath could cloud a mirror , and Ali could n't believe it . At the bell ending the fourth , all he could do was sniff at Joe , ' You dumb chump , you ! ' " <p> ROUND 5 <p> Don Dunphy : " I 'd have to say that this is an awful like the first fight between Frazier and Ali in 1971 , when Ali built up a big lead and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came on there . " <p> Ken Norton : " Very good left hook there by Joe . This is going to be very detrimental to Ali in the later rounds if he stays in the ropes . " <p> Angelo Dundee : " The fifth was Frazier , Frazier and more Frazier . . . My screams became shriller and more insistent : ' Get off the goddamn ropes . Get out of the goddamn corner . Stop playing ! ' " <p> Eddie Futch : " I wanted him to pressure Ali and back him against the ropes so he could get off those good , solid body shots with the hopes of bringing Ali 's hands down for the shots to the head . Most of the fellas , when they fought Ali , they would back him to the ropes then go immediately to the head with the left hook . ( Ali ) would just pull back , stretch the rope , make the puncher miss and you 're off balance then he 'll hit you with a thousand punches . " <p> ROUND 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a interview that appeared on Muhammad Ali : His Life and Times : " Frazier hit Ali with a left hook that 's the hardest punch I 've ever seen . It had to be harder than the punch he knocked Ali down with in their first fight . Ali 's head turned like it was on a swivel , and his response was to look at Frazier and say , ' They told me Joe Frazier was washed up . ' And Frazier answered , ' They lied . ' " <p> Jerry Izenberg : " They were tremendous hooks . And you have to understand , normal fighters would not have continued . I mean , this fight could have been over six times . " <p> Mark Kram : " Once more the pattern emerged as Frazier loosed all of the fury , all that has made him a brilliant heavyweight . He was in close now , fighting off Ali 's chest , the place where he has to be . His old calling card -- that sudden evil , his left hook -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pacheco : " By the end of this round , Joe Frazier was n't only fighting with strength , but he was fighting with joy . It 's as if he understood that the title was his for the taking , that Ali was getting tired and he was getting stronger . " <p> Angelo Dundee : " By the sixth any and all thoughts of an easy victory for Ali had vanished as Frazier attached himself to Muhammad 's chest and let fly with several left hooks from hell , catching Ali with two that caused the crowd to gasp , President Marcos to wince and Imelda Marcos to stare down at her shoes . " <p> ROUND 7 <p> Ken Norton : " At the present time , I would have to say that Frazier is in better condition . " <p> Dave Wolf from Muhammad Ali : His Life and Times : " By the seventh round , neither man had any mobility left at all . They were just standing there , pounding on each other . And there was frustration in watching it , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe was to batter Ali 's arms . We knew Ali would do the rope-a-dope , and it would be hard to come up the middle against him at first . But if you beat the crap out of his arms , a space would open up ; and Joe did n't do that enough . . . I think it came down to this emotional thing , where he was fighting with so much hatred that it was almost as though he could n't be bothered to go after the arms . He wanted Ali 's head . " <p> ROUND 8 <p> Don Dunphy , in the " Thrilla " documentary : " Hugh , the ' 71 fight was a super fight , but I think this is just as super . " <p> Hugh O'Brien : " Actually , I think it 's better . Ali 's really staying in there and punching with him all the way . You could n't say either one is carrying the fight to the other at this point I do n't think . And I think they 're both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of times that he got hit in the head , he got caught there , he could stand there and he could keep coming at him . He 's fantastic . " <p> Eddie Futch : " I was n't too concerned about those shots because the shots never had the full body of Ali into him . Joe has the faculty of making his opponent hurry everything that he did . Consequently , although Ali was rather landing him frequently there , he did n't have the full power had he had more time . " <p> ROUND 9 <p> Don Dunphy : " I give that round to Frazier on aggressiveness . " <p> Ken Norton : " Power and aggressiveness . Plus when Ali starts to box , he dances for maybe a few seconds and he always ends up with his back on the ropes , which is very bad . This is Joe 's best place . If Ali stays on the ropes , he 's going to be picked to death by Joe 's punching power . And that 's why Ali needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or he has to put Frazier on the ropes and get off the ropes quick . If ( Ali ) stays on the ropes , he 's definitely going to fall behind . Joe 's best position is on the ropes . He ca n't match Ali for speed in the middle of the ring . He ca n't do anything in the middle of the ring . He 's too short . " <p> Don Dunphy : I would think that ( Frazier 's ) body shots have got to take some toll on Ali , but Ali 's a remarkable athlete . Up to now , they do n't seem to have bothered him . <p> Ken Norton : " They have to bother him . He has n't been dancing . He starts to dance and he comes off his toes , which means the body shots are bothering him . " <p> Eddie Futch : " I thought our battle plan was being put into play . I figured that the fact that Frazier was able to get to Ali in the latter part of every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come on to winning the last few rounds . " <p> Freddie Pacheco , from the NBC special : " Frazier begins to understand that his chances of a championship are diminishing as the punishment and damage to his face increases . " <p> ROUND 10 <p> Ferdie Pacheco : " Ali thought he was dying . In the 10th round , he said , ' I think this is what dying is like . " I said , ' You 're not dying . We got a long ways to go before we get to dying . ' Like after the 15th round , you can die . But up to that point , you got ta keep on fighting . " <p> Muhammad Ali 's face during the tenth round shows the damage he had incurred . Screenshot from YouTube <p> Angelo Dundee : " I said , well , we got ta separate the men from the boys . What the heck . The shots they were nailing each other then . Battle of attrition . Wanted it more . It was all there . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the Thrilla that everyone expected . I think we 're in for a few more rounds . I was awful in my prediction of it ending before nine . " <p> ROUND 11 <p> Don Dunphy : " I 've seen a lot of them , but this has got to rank with Louis and Conn , Marciano and Walcott and the first Ali-Frazier fight . This is one of the great ones . " <p> Ken Norton : " That 's very true . These men are n't staying on the ropes . This is when men become men . There 's no playing on the ropes . Ali 's fighting back . He 's fighting more than people thought he could on the inside . There 's a lot of action here . " <p> Ed Schuyler , as quoted in the Thrilla documentary : " After four rounds , I thought it was 2-1-1 for Ali . But from the fifth round through the 11th , I only gave Ali one round . " <p> ROUND 12 <p> Don Dunphy : " I thought Joe Frazier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round . He had Ali on the ropes a couple of times and he did n't seem to have any zip . Now that 's just my opinion . " <p> Ken Norton : " I think he was told from his corner by Eddie Futch , that he 's been throwing a lot of power shots to the body . . . I would have to say that Eddie had told the man like get him on the ropes , throw the punches , do n't put as much power into them , just get the points behind them . " <p> Angelo Dundee : " Somehow , someway , somewhere with both gladiators running on empty , Muhammad found that something extra in his gas tank in the twelfth after I had exhorted him to ' go get him . ' Using his long right , he reversed the by now all-too-evident flow of the fight by getting back on his toes and pummeling Frazier 's face , turning it into a mass of lumps , bringing a trickle of blood from his mouth and closing his left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who in the eleventh round looked like he could have tossed it in , sucking it up and dominating Frazier . " <p> Eddie Futch : " I was concerned about the swelling in the left eye because it was quite pronounced at this time . I was afraid that Joe was going to have a lot of trouble seeing those right hands coming and it turned out to be the case . " <p> Joe Frazier 's cornerman , George Benton : " What I would 've done , I would 've told Eddie , ' Look Ed , let 's just make ( Frazier ) jump up and down in the corner and throw punches up in the air like he was trying to kill ( Ali ) . ' And Ali seeing this and seeing Joe full of venom , he would 've probably quit in the corner seeing Joe had so much left . But we really did n't know . I heard Ali say , ' I 'm not going back out there , this man 's crazy . ' But we did n't take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Joe could go on with his bad eye . But now looking back , that 's what I would 've done . " <p> ROUND 13 <p> Ken Norton : " Ali seems to coast until he sees an opening . When he has that opening , he throws a big , rapid flurry . This has been Joe 's downfall . Joe can not match hand speed with him , so when Ali throws a quick flurry at him , he 's very vulnerable . Very vulnerable . " <p> Eddie Futch : " The 13th round was very bad , but I thought maybe Ali had punched himself out and would be arm-weary after landing so many good blows . That 's the reason I let Joe go out for the fourteenth , and it was worse than the round before . " <p> George Benton : " Like I said before , if we had made Joe bounce up and down , that would 've gotten ( Ali ) to quit . But in all reality , Joe had one eye in that round . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way he could knock Ali out coz he did n't have any power . There was nothing there . Nothing but slaps . Neither one of them had anything left , but the thing Ali had going for him was that each time he poked Joe in the eye , the lightest punch , it could hurt him because his eyes were already swollen . " <p> ROUND 14 <p> Ferdie Pacheco , from the Thrilla in Manila documentary : " Round 14 was the closest thing I 've seen somebody kill somebody . He was very close to killing him . " <p> Joe Frazier , recalling his mindset in the moment in The Thrilla in Manila documentary : " No , man . Let me continue . I do n't want to stop . Let 's keep on going . C'm on , Ed . " <p> Eddie Futch : " I saw that Joe was n't able to see the punches coming , especially the right hand . He was getting hit by punches that he did n't see at all . So I did n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably fatally injured . So I stopped the fight . <p> Frazier would have continued . In fact , he resisted slightly when I told him the fight was over . He had been sitting on the stool and he jumped up and I just put my hand on his shoulder and pressed gently and he sat down again . He 'll be relying on my judgment . " <p> Thomas Hauser : " Wali Muhammad , who was a cornerman for Ali , told something that I had n't heard before and found extraordinary but Ali later confirmed for me , which is Ali went back to his corner and said to Angelo , ' Cut ' em off . ' " <p> Wali Muhammad , from Muhammad Ali : His Life and Times : " After the fourteenth round , Ali came back to the corner and told us , ' Cut ' em off . ' That 's how tired he was . He wanted us to cut his gloves off . And Angelo ignored him . He started wiping Ali 's face , getting him ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quitter ; he 'd never quit . But I 'd never seen him exhausted like that before . Then somebody -- I think it was Kilroy ( Gene Kilroy , coordinator for Ali 's camp ) -- looked across the ring and saw Eddie Futch call the ref over . Kilroy started shouting , " It 's over ! It 's over ! " And the feeling I had then ; I ca n't express it . In the dressing room afterward , Bundini ( Drew " Bundini " Brown , Ali 's cornerman ) and me , we just broke down and cried . ' " <p> Dave Wolf : " I believe that Ali was significantly more exhausted and had been beaten so much to the body that there was a real chance that if Eddie Futch had not stopped the fight in the corner after the 14th round that Ali would n't have come out for the 15th round and that Joe would 've won . I know that 's what Joe believed at that time . " <p> EPILOGUE <p> Futch 's decision would gnaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book , Ghosts of Manila , Frazier at one point brushed aside Futch 's reasoning that he was only trying to save his life , even attacking his trainer 's judgment many years after the fight . <p> Frazier told Kram that Futch had been " too soft to have been in charge " and that Yank Durham , Frazier 's manager right before Futch , would have sent him out for the 15th round in Manila . Futch said he never regretted making the call because he had witnessed boxers die in the ring . <p> In Manila , Ali emerged the victor , but in Frazier 's mind he won the war . In several instances years later , Frazier relished the thought that he was responsible for Ali 's current debilitating condition . He had gone on record to say he no longer harbored any ill will , but there had been interviews of Frazier in which it was evident some animosity still festered . <p> Freddie Roach , who had trained under Futch , knew how embittered Frazier was . " I know he was mad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roach said . " It took a little time for him to get over it . " <p> Futch died on Oct. 10 , 2001 . Frazier fought twice more after Manila before hanging up his gloves . He died on Nov. 7 , 2011 . <p> Immediately after Ali was declared the winner , he collapsed on the mat because of utter exhaustion . He would soften his tone on Frazier , apologizing on a number of occasions for the times he had insulted him and acknowledging that it was all promotional not personal . <p> Ali fought 10 more times after the Thrilla , a stretch that included claiming the world heavyweight title for a third time following his victory over Leon Spinks in September 1978 . In 1984 , Ali was diagnosed with Parkinson 's disease . <p> It took a long while before Ali and Frazier watched the Thrilla in Manila . <p> Frazier had n't seen it until he was convinced to do it for the Thrilla in Manila documentary in 2009 . For Ali 's part , Hauser , in a story he wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that it was one of his greatest ring triumphs , there was no joy in Muhammad 's face as we watched Ai-Frazier III unfold . " <p> Ali , now 73 , attended Frazier 's funeral in November 2011 . <p> " Joe Frazier is a good man , " Ali told Hauser in his book . " I could n't have done what I did without him , and he could n't have done what he did without me . And if God ever calls me to a holy war , I want Joe Frazier fighting beside me .

@@3635233 <h> Glacier Residents Include Birds and Mammals <p> A recent article in the Journal of Biogeography provides the first systematic review of birds and mammals which include glaciers ( and perennial snow patches ) as part of their regular habitats . The author , J ? rgen Rosvold of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology , documents the great importance of these cold frozen environments for a number of warm-blooded active species , which are known as chionophiles ( snow-loving organisms ) . In total , glaciers and perennial snow patches are frequented by 19 bird species and 16 mammalian species -- or 17 , if humans are included . It is not surprising that other vertebrate groups , such as reptiles and amphibians , are absent from glaciers , since they are cold-blooded and could not survive long exposure to such low temperatures . <p> The most common order of birds in these habitats is the passerines , or songbirds . However , other groups are represented . The golden eagle is a member of the falcon order , and the common raven , like crows , jays and their relatives , is a corvid . Several species of ptarmigan represent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , partridges , pheasants , quail and grouse . <p> The avian behavior most often recorded on glaciers is obtaining food -- insects and worms in the case of smaller birds , other birds and mammals for the golden eagle . One bird species , the white-winged diuca finch , constructs its nest on the surface of glaciers in the Andes ; it has been systematically studied on Quelccaya Glacier in Peru . <p> The mammals are more diverse , both in terms of taxonomy and behavior . Most common are the ungulates such as bison , musk ox , elk , reindeer , mountain goat , ibex , chamois and bighorn sheep , who come for relief from the heat ; as large animals covered with fur and hair , they have difficulty cooling off during hot periods , and either lie directly on the ice , or rest in the cold air that drains off glaciers . A much smaller mammal , the pica ( a lagomorph , or relative of rabbits and hares ) , also uses glaciers for this purpose . They have also been observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bighorn lambs play on the open surfaces of glaciers and snow patches . The carnivores -- bears , snow leopards and wolverines -- travel across glaciers and snow patches , perhaps to avoid leaving a scent . Wolverines have also been seen caching their prey on glaciers ; the author suggests that this behavior may provide lactating females with critical components of their diet during the period when they are nursing their cubs . <p> This article rests largely on the direct observations of field biologists . In the future , this valuable , though time-consuming , research method may be complemented by the use of radio collars to track animal movements .

Jose Francisco " Joefran " Talaban after the Senate budget hearing on the Aurora Pacific Economic Zone and Freeport ( APECO ) on September 29 . " We should not be tired of working for the community , for the development of the people . " <p> Talaban is an organizer of Task Force Anti-APECO ( TFAA ) , a group that is seeking feasibility studies of APECO 's projects as well as financial accountability for the excess spending that has not yet been justified . TFAA -- and supporters of APECO as well -- joined a mobilization outside the Senate as leaders inside discussed once again the APECO budget . <p> APECO was created in 2007 through Republic Act No. 9490 with the goal of boosting economic and industrial development in Aurora and nearby provinces . Covering over 12,923 hectares in the municipality of Casiguran , it was envisioned to attract businesses and investors through tax incentives provided by the government . <p> Last year , it was settled that the 2015 APECO budget would be cut from Php @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allotted for maintenance fees . <p> Anomaly analysis <p> This year , the TFAA , under the secretariat of the Simbahang Lingkod ng Bayan ( SLB ) , advocated for the reduction of the budget allocation for APECO to zero , and a special investigation to be conducted by the Commission on Audit ( COA ) , among other objectives . <p> In his presentation , Alpasa railed against the Php 486M airport built on farmers ' land and its neglect , which led to its disintegration . <p> " We have the most expensive rice dryer in the world , " quipped Senator Sergio Osme ? a III , referring to the airstrip 's current function for farmers . <p> For his part , Gutierrez raised the fact that the facilities are vulnerable to destruction of typhoons and other natural calamities . On 2013 , typhoon Labuyo swept through northern Luzon and damaged most of the facilities built by APECO . <p> Moreover , the financial irregularities of APECO remain a controversial issue , with the current notice of disallowances amounting to Php 416M , up from Php 335M @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyer for the Casiguran farmers affected by the economic zone and a supporter of TFAA , said that the discrepancy in funds breeds distrust and suspicion . <p> " There 's so much money there and there 's so much questionable items there that there may be government money in the wrong pockets , " he said . <p> Conflict of interests <p> Aside from APECO 's lack of financial accountability , infrastructures that it claimed would be instrumental to a " globally competitive , technologically advanced economic zone " are the same ones displacing the locals and taking away their means of sustainability . <p> The housing settlement , for example , was built upon irrigated land where natives harvest rice . The construction of the unused airstrip had also led displaced locals to build their own huts with the money Apeco paid them . As the majority of the natives are fisherfolk and farmers , their concern lies in relocation , where they will be farther from their land and livelihood . <p> In an Inquirer article , fisherman Marlon Angara commented that it was a bad idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't be fishermen if we do n't have access to the sea , " he shared . <p> The illegal cutting of mangroves , among other environmental concerns , was also tackled during the budget hearing . In their presentation , TFAA showed the inconsistency of APECO 's claims of conserving natural resources when there was unauthorized activity detrimental to the environment . <p> Monsod related the illegal cutting to the discrepancies in APECO 's finances and implementation . <p> " When they purchased the forest concession of a member of the board of APECO for PHP 120M , why did they do it ? " Monsod said . " Because they say , ' we think we can take better care of the forest ' , but look at what is happening in the forest , illegal cutting is still going on . " <p> He continued , saying the government granted the concession but bought it back with government money on the basis of the present value of expected earnings from the project . <p> " There 's something wrong with that , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem lies in the question of bringing necessary services to encourage human development , instead of focusing on the development of a place . <p> He noted that the Casiguran people prefer to have the allotted funds for APECO to be invested on health and education , and then allow them to seek opportunities elsewhere . <p> " Build the capacity , and go where the flow of development is , instead of trying to force the issue , with the economic zone that , obviously , is not viable in that area , " Monsod suggested . <p> Human infrastructure <p> For his part , APECO president and chief executive officer of Atty . Gerardo Erguiza emphasized that the development of human infrastructure should be the prime concern of APECO and is integral to the success of the economic zone . <p> " The bottomline here is what is most beneficial to the people , whether or not you are pro or against APECO , " he said in a mix of English and Filipino . <p> According to Erguiza , Apeco is still in its gestation period , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> He cited the cases of Subic and Clark economic zones , with budgets of Php 100B and Php 80B respectively . " These two facilities only started to earn income in 2012 , " he stated . <p> Because of this , APECO faces what Erguiza termed a " chicken and egg " problem , where the skepticism regarding the project brings few investors to the project , thus in turn , leading to insufficient funds . <p> " So there is a question of ' chicken and egg ' , since Senator Osme ? a said not to put infrastructure there because it was a failure from the very start , " Erguiza said in a mix of English and Filipino . <p> However , both parties are aware that compromise is necessary and essential to the progress of Casiguran . <p> " In the dynamics of legislation , APECO will be given a budget , ' di naman pwede just close the offices , but it should be strictly for a caretaker purpose , " said Monsod . <p> " While in this position of reduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at pagkatubo ng mga tao ( we want to be able to accomplish much within our parameters in the way of growth and development of the people ) , " said Erguiza . <p> As for TFAA , they continue to organize and develop the skills of Casiguran natives so that they can claim their stake in the conversation . With the help of SLB and the Jesuit Volunteers of the Philippines , they provide them alternative livelihood programs such as organic farming and sustainable agriculture .

" <p> Benjamin Diokno , University of the Philippines economist , echoed Mapa 's view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deficit would cause a potential downgrade by international ratings agencies , hence the unchanged income tax system . " <p> He explained that in 2014 , the Aquino administration targeted a budget deficit of P266.2 billion ( $5.70 billion ) or 2% of GDP . Actual deficit was only P73.1 billion ( $1.56 billion ) or 0.6% of GDP , and this is not because of higher-than-targeted revenue intake . <p> " The lower deficit was due to simple incompetence or poor budget planning or both , " Diokno , who is also the former budget secretary , told Rappler in an interview . <p> " The same horrible story is unfolding this year , " Diokno said . <p> " The Aquino administration is more afraid of the threat of a downgrade by foreign ratings agencies than incurring the collective wrath of Filipino taxpayers , who have to contend with the increasingly burdensome 19-year-old tax system , " he added . <p> For Purisima , the high income tax rate is to address the need for increased education and infrastructure spending . <p> " The need for education , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of GDP , we spend lower for education than our neighbors . In the case of the Philippines , we only spend about 3% of GDP , while others spend 5% of GDP , " the Finance secretary explained . <p> " If we want to improve infrastructure , we need to put in at least 5% of GDP for many years . Same with education spending . So the point is , we need revenue to make sure we attain these growth targets , " Purisima added . <p> A call for uniform , equitable taxation <p> For Ronilo Balbieran , a research associate from Research , Education , and Institutional Development ( REID ) Foundation , having the highest tax rate in ASEAN-6 is not a problem in itself , as different countries would have their different fiscal policies and developmental goals . <p> " In our case , the Philippine Constitution mandates that we should have a uniform , equitable taxation , and that Congress should evolve a progressive taxation system , " Balbieran told Rappler in an interview . <p> " It will require thorough studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We should answer first whether we are hitting our productive capacity and how much does the government need to spend to achieve full utilization of our productive capacity of economy , " he added . <p> But Balbieran pointed out in an email correspondence that the unadjusted tax bracket under the Tax Reform Act of 1997 has to be addressed as soon as possible . <p> According to the Bureau of Internal Revenue , the Tax Reform Act of 1997 has this matrix of tax rates : <p> NET TAXABLE INCOME .

@@3648230 <h> High Electricity Bills Drive Companies to Go Green <p> Khmer Times/Jonathan Cox <p> Monday , 05 October 2015 <p> 872 views <p> Cambodian electricity is among the most expensive in the world . High government tariffs mean it can cost as much as 21 cents per kilowatt-hour for electricity in the capital , and more in the provinces where the electrical grid is underdeveloped . The high prices have made managing electricity bills difficult for hotels and restaurants that require extensive lighting and air conditioning . This has led companies ranging from brick kilns to garment factories to five-star hotels to find new ways to cut their electricity bills . <p> Unlike neighboring countries where electricity is generated from natural gas , coal , or hydroelectric power , most of Cambodia 's electricity is generated by the more expensive method of burning heavy oil . Officials from the Ministry of Mines and Energy and the main electricity provider , Electricite du Cambodge ( EDC ) , could not be reached for comment on the reasons behind the high electricity costs . <p> Despite high power bills , many factories in Cambodia have used inefficient , energy-hungry machinery .

As part of the IEE project , 52 Cambodian factories invested a combined $12 million in improving energy efficiency . The factories come from some of the country 's most energy-hungry sectors -- rice milling , ice production , rubber , the garment sector , food processing , and brick manufacturing . <p> Mr. Gupta said the improvements have saved the businesses a combined $9 million annually , as well as dramatically cutting these businesses ' greenhouse gas emissions . <p> Many of the factories that partner with IEE improve efficiency by replacing machinery with more energy-efficient alternatives .

Add to that how our schedules and daily demands can forgo a healthy hair routine . <p> We got to catch-up with celebrity hairstylist and Asia 's Next Top Model mentor Lourd Ramos about a few haircare issues . He cut out some facts from the fiction , and tells us what it takes to get a great mane . <p> #1 Do n't forget to shampoo daily Lourd tells us that despite the rise of the dry shampoo and skipping showers , traditional shampooing is still most essential . " People think that they do n't have to shampoo everyday , " he says . " That 's a myth because every day our hair traps bacteria and free radicals that can only be cleansed by shampoo and water .

Unless it says that it is for the scalp , you just need to put conditioner on the tips of your hair .

" This is especially true with the different leave-in treatments we have nowadays that require you to leave your hair a little wet , " says Lourd . But he does still warn against tying your hair in a bun right after you step out of the shower or leaving it wrapped up in a towel since this can cause hair breakage . <p> #4 Be sharp about it Razor cuts are great way to tame thick , unruly hair . However , he reminds us that we must be keen on the number of times the hairstylist uses his or her razor . " I believe in razor cuts , as long as you use feathered razors and you make sure the razors are used for just eight haircuts . You ca n't keep it for 36 haircuts .

North Carolina features " undoubtedly the premier governor 's race of the country " for 2016 , and if the election were held today GOP Gov . Pat McCrory would be re-elected despite shaky approval ratings , said Tom Jensen , director of the Raleigh-based firm Public Policy Polling . <p> Jensen spoke of the race expected to pit McCrory against Democratic Attorney General Roy Cooper at a Wednesday luncheon event sponsored by the John Locke Foundation . PPP is a national political research firm that surveys voter positions in state and national elections . <p> Based on current polling data , Jensen said two-term GOP U.S Sen. Richard Burr appears to be on track for re-election . Democrat Hillary Clinton is far behind the Republican presidential field in North Carolina , and GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump still leads state polls . <p> McCrory , like Burr , " is not beloved by Republicans , " Jensen said . <p> McCrory has an approval rating among Republicans between 60 percent and 65 percent . Popular incumbents normally have an approval rating of between 80 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result , the governor 's overall favorability rating has languished at about 40 percent , and his disapproval rating about 45 percent . <p> However , Jensen said , Republicans who say they do n't like McCrory still would vote for him instead of a Democrat . He expects to see more " straight-down-the-line partisan " votes in 2016 than in past elections . That could hurt McCrory , who got a 25-30 percent crossover vote from Democrats in 2012 , he said . <p> While he views the 2016 race as " an undisputed toss-up , " Jensen said " if the election was today Gov . McCrory would get re-elected , " according to PPP polling . " McCrory 's advantage , though small , has always been continuous " in seven of 10 monthly polls this year . <p> McCrory 's approval numbers dipped as low as the mid-30s this summer , but Jensen said that was expected . <p> " The governor gets more unpopular with the voters when the legislature is in town every year . It happened when Gov . Beverly Perdue was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Jensen said . Cooper led McCrory by 2 to 3 points in June , July , and August , but this month the governor topped Cooper by 2 points . <p> " One of the most interesting things we know about Roy Cooper is that a majority of North Carolinians do n't know him , " Jensen said . That is a reflection of the fact that most voters do n't pay much attention to down-ballot races . <p> PPP polling shows only 50 percent of voters have an opinion of Cooper , compared to 70 percent in 2008 . Jensen attributes that to Cooper 's high profile during the Duke lacrosse hoax in which he declared the falsely accused defendants innocent of raping a stripper . <p> Running unopposed in 2012 further blunted his public profile , Jensen said . The unknowns present an opportunity for him to create a positive image for voters . But it is also a risk if Republicans define him negatively first . <p> Cooper 's polling numbers are similar to those of former Democratic U.S. Sen. Kay Hagan at this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Speaker Thom Tillis , Jensen said . <p> Independent organizations started attacking her and " really drove a negative opinion towards her in voters ' minds that she was n't ever able to really come back from , " Jensen said . <p> He expects a repeat of " a heck of a lot of money coming in on both sides bashing the heck out of both of these candidates , " calling it " the era of $100 million worth of attack ads . " <p> Independents do n't particularly like McCrory or Cooper , though McCrory has about a 10-point advantage among them . That is well below his 2-to-1 advantage among independents in 2012 . <p> Jensen said Democratic candidate Ken Spaulding , a Durham attorney and former state legislator , is a long-shot candidate with 15 percent name recognition , similar to what would be expected if pulling a random name from a phone book . <p> In the U.S. Senate race , Burr " has very soft approval numbers , which is the bad news for him , " Jensen said . The good news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it did n't stop him from getting re-elected by 12 points in 2010 . " <p> " We found that only 47 percent of Republicans approve of the job he 's doing , " Jensen said . But like McCrory , he would benefit from Republicans voting along party lines . <p> Burr leads Democratic opponents Deborah Ross , a former Wake County legislator , and Spring Lake Mayor Chris Rey by about 10 points . Roughly 20 percent of voters have an opinion of Ross and Rey . <p> Jensen said the race is reminiscent of incumbent Republican Sen. Elizabeth Dole eight years ago , when a host of Democrats refused to run against her , and Hagan , then a state senator , stepped forward . Hagan polled by a margin similar to that of Ross and Rey , and ended up winning . <p> Jensen added that 2008 was a great Democratic year . " I do n't think 2016 is going to be a great Democratic year . " <p> The presidential race is not looking as competitive in North Carolina as it did in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separated Barack Obama from Republicans John McCain and Mitt Romney . <p> In PPP 's last statewide poll , Clinton was down 9 to 10 points to GOP candidates Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina , and 5 points to Trump and Marco Rubio .

But he does n't expect that lead to last , as some GOP aspirants drop out and direct their voters to someone other than Trump . <p> And when Trump is matched head-to-head with other GOP candidates in the polling , " Carson blows Trump away " by 15 to 20 points every time , Jensen said . Rubio and Fiorina tie with Trump . " Trump beats Jeb Bush head to head by about 20 points , so I think Bush really is in big trouble .

@@4885231 <h> Wedding Bell Rings : The Changing Trends in Wedding Fashion <p> Shimmery Shamiana , flower garlands , aroma from the roasted spices , clinks of bangles and the sound of groovy music are the things what comes to our mind when we think of a wedding . Wedding is considered one of the most important celebrations of life in the world ; however , people in this sub-continent take the enthusiasm for weddings to a new level . It is not just about tying the knot between two souls ; it is also about getting the whole family and friends together and celebrating until running out of breaths or cash . Whereas the passion for fine celebration remained same , the trend in celebrating changed . Nothing lasts forever , and fashion style is the first of them . Do you think the trends in wedding fashion you saw ten years ago are still same ? How much did the wedding festivals change ? What caused it ? <p> The bride 's attire is undeniably the most important component of a wedding . A bride can never walk the aisle without the perfect clothe . For the purpose of making one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose the best dress . Perhaps , this is why , it has been prone to so many alterations . To every fashion savvy bride , finding the best " it " dress is as crucial as finding the perfect match in matrimony . Every year , with the changing winds , the wedding fashion gradually changes . However , it usually takes at least half of a decade to notice a significant change . Although , the glamorous vibe was persistent all along , the way glamour was dealt , changed from time to time . <p> If time duration was a criteria , georgette fabric would be the clear winner . After the heavyweight reign of Katan-Banarasi sarees in eighties and the beginning of nineties , the lightweight georgette ones seemed like a breath of fresh air to the gleaming brides . The trend that began in the middle of the nineties , lasted until the middle of the millennium . Vibrant designs and relatively lighter weight made georgette and chiffon fabric every bride 's favorite . They were adorned with splendid needle works done with golden or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabric remained same for a long time , the variation in color and design kept changing from time to time . That time was also the reign of Indian movies and sunrises ; the fashion styles shown there had a direct impact on our fashion world . The design showcased in Indian media became the hot cakes of our fashion worlds . The heavily embroidered saree and lehengas were the first favorite of all the brides . Brides tried to experiment with colors as well , red remained but it was also replaced by pink , orange or even at times with shades of blue . <p> The beginning of 2005 was also the beginning of a new trend in wedding fashion . The strong control that embroidered georgette and chiffon had on brides had begun to loosen . Brides started acknowledging more of the Bangladeshi materials than before . Many started choosing Katan over the Indian sarees ; Jamdani and Muslin also became a part of wedding fashion . The experiment with colors persisted . Red lost its clutch a slight bit and light colors and shades became more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> For last two- three years , katan banarsi is again walking on the road to glory . Girls are bringing their mother 's sarees out and merging them with new modern ideas to make them look extraordinary . In recent years , another style that has showing strong potential is the Pakistani fashion . The unique designs , fusion and role breaking color theme is attracting the brides . The dresses named Gharara or Sharara are the merger between kameez and lehenga . They are easy to wear and magnificent to flaunt around . The arrival of eastern themed gowns is also noticed ; they are the union between our traditional motif and western gown shaped designs . Another trend that is seen is , brides wearing desi designs and sarees in one program and for the other one , the newly designed foreign attire . Thus , balancing the both world . <p> One change or new addition to the wedding fashion is the Hijab . Before , brides did not follow the custom of wearing Hijabs in wedding very often . Now , we are seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day Hijabs are not ordinary ones , they have the equal caliber to match the glimmer of the whole attire . Moreover , they are adorned with traditional jewelries for head . <p> There was a change in the jewelry fashions as well . In nineties gold chokers were seen in fashion , they almost disappeared in later years . The heavy gold necklaces remained for a good period . However , there designs had variation . Drifting from the traditional multi layered designs , brides started to choose contemporary ones . The use of gems added a new dimension in design . Diamond started to glitter in the necklaces and bangles . Many brides , who chose desi materials as wedding fabric , wore silver jewelries as well . However , during these years , gold is not the best voted ornament . Girls are more interested into modern , multi colored gem designs . Meenakari and kundan work is triumphing . Lighter and smaller jewelries are highly applauded for their convenience . Jewelries for head are again becoming popular and once lost big nose pins are back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excused from change . The programs like ' Gaye Holud ' have seen the most perhaps . A decade ago , the way it was celebrated is no longer same . The food menu and the program planning have seen the most significant change . There used to be only light snack for the guests in that program , but later on these days , even a buffet does not seem sufficient enough . The arrival of DJ 's in the Gaye Holud program was part of the change . This trend stayed for a few good years ; however , these days that trend seems to be going away . Instead , dance performance conducted by close ones seems more fascinating . The trend of wearing same colored clothes in this program is not unnoticed . Moreover , the programs like Mehndi Night are added in the wedding plan . <p> Another place where change is seen is the photography sector . The way people took photographs ten years ago no longer seem valid . The beauty of the gorgeous bride is captured from every different angle . Romantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candies of any wedding program these days . Along with traditional group or family portraits , selfies have also made a place in the wedding photo session . However , the custom of video recording has ceased to exist . Theme based photography like western countries has added diversity in the wedding shoot . <p> The nature of every trend or fashion is to keep changing . As a course , wedding trends have changed as well . A few changes are good , a few of them great and after a time they might come back again . This was just an attempt to say something about them . When your wedding bell will ring , you will know what you want to choose .

Start with the basics and add on to it as you progress . <p> GLASSWARE <p> For your first set of glasses , maybe you can go for something more versatile and durable , like a set of rock glasses and highball glasses .

Old jam jars , tin cans , old teacups , beakers , the list goes on and on . If you can afford it , by all means get some crystal stemware as well .

The basic garnishes are citrus ( lemon , lime , calamansi , orange ) , mint and one of my favorites ... the sexy cucumber . You can prep them ahead of time and store them in your fridge so that when it 's time to party , you 're good to go . You can go even a step further by showing off or presenting your fruit garnishes on a nice dish that can hold crushed ice and display them on top . <p> Since it 's the holiday season , you can also get garnishes for the holiday drinks you might want to make : like little candy canes you can find in the supermarket , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> MIXERS <p> Mixers make all spirits more palatable , it enhances a cocktail and is always non-alcoholic . As for mixers , you ca n't go wrong with club soda , tonic , water , cola , ginger ale and fresh juices . <p> BITTERS <p> If you 're feeling like you want to step this up , get some bitters . They are great at adding sex appeal to cocktails , even if it is just a drop . Bitters can transform a good drink into a great one . Angostura bitters is the most versatile . There are so many great brands and flavors , but hard to find in Manila . Bitter Truth is sometimes available . Check Booze Online . <p> SWEETENER / SYRUPS <p> You must add a sweetener or syrup in your drink . It helps with the texture and balances the taste of your cocktail ( balance of sweet and sour ) , also enhances flavor . You can make your own simple syrup by dissolving equal parts of water and sugar over heat ( it will keep for several weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts sugar and one part water as well . Not to make the drinks sugar heavy , but to balance the sour ratios to their proper place and lessen added water . If you wan to get fancy , you can flavor your syrups with vanilla , cinnamon , cardamom , etc .

This area will evolve with time so it 's best to start with the standards : vodka , rum , gin , whisky , bourbon . Tequila . Buy what you like to drink .

But Meas Channa 's men still needed to find one more goal to send the tie into extra-time . <p> In search of the vital goal , Naga piled on the pressure , forcing Crown deep , and with only a minute left on the clock Korean defender Yong-sun Baek gave away a penalty , which was duly converted from the spot by a grateful Sokumpheak . The score , now 3-3 , sent the game into extra time . <p> Soksela Shootout Hero <p> Extra time saw Naga forward Barry Lelouma come close from the dead-ball ; his free-kick finding its way past a host of players and to safety just inches from goal .

Kazuaki Ban found the back of the net for Naga , although Sokthorn failed to do the same for Crown .

@@4943232 <h> Less candidates better for Jojo Binay <p> Ironically , the suspicions that the " powers that be " are behind the disqualification of Senator Grace Poe and the planned massive demolition job on Davao City mayor Digong Duterte have only boomeranged and hurt the chances of Liberal Party candidate Mar Roxas . <p> The results of the latest Pulse Asia survey showing Vice President Jojo Binay in the lead at 33 percent while the Social Weather Stations survey showed him statistically tied with Senator Grace Poe on top at 26 percent clearly show that the less candidates there are , the better the vice president 's chances are of winning the presidency in May 2016 . <p> We can all agree with Star columnist Alex Magno that Vice President Binay would be the ultimate beneficiary if Poe and Duterte are taken out of the race . It 's a well-known fact that Jojo Binay has a solid base that has shown support despite the consistent barrage of accusations and allegations that have been thrown his way .

Aside from the " sisterhood " arrangement , Binay also knew he could count on the " brotherhood " -- the Alpha Phi Omega fraternity to be exact , with the members -- many of them in influential positions -- banding together to throw the full weight of their support for their " brod . " <p> Our in-house survey analyst tells us that the disqualification of both Duterte and Poe would result in the migration of votes to Binay from the two 's respective supporters who would be raring to " punish " those whom they deem responsible for the disqualification -- which could only worsen the scenario for the administration candidate who continues to be at the tail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asia actually showed Mar 's numbers declining by four percent from 21 to 17 percent . <p> People 's prevailing perception that the Commission on Elections has shown " indecent haste " in moving to disqualify Senator Poe -- giving her a one-two-three punch within the space of three weeks with decisions from the Second Division , then the First Division and finally the en banc , have only strengthened suspicions that the administration is responsible for the moves against Poe . Her supporters are naturally angry because they see a well-orchestrated effort , pointing to the timing of the Comelec 's decision on Wednesday -- just before government offices closed for Christmas vacation and with the Supreme Court on holiday recess . This leaves Grace with only one option -- which is to file a petition for a temporary restraining order before the SC .

In the event that Duterte is also disqualified , the mayor had also publicly announced he will campaign for Vice President Binay .
