None of that happened on Jan 6 , 2014 , the opening night of Julius John 's solo exhibition at the Rohtas 2 in Lahore . <p> It was a different kind of experience , something that can be collected and retained in memory , though not in a tangible form . <p> John 's installation on display does not have any art objects , except two bathtubs and a plastic Christmas tree . A major part of the show comprises huge black crayon drawings executed on the gallery 's walls . These are images of houses , with details of structure , an ordinary metal chair and a plastic water tank on the roof , all rendered impressively . One of the bathtubs placed in the middle of the room is filled with black oil , while the one next to it is turned upside down with a pink plastic Christmas tree fixed on top of it . <p> All of these refer to the artist 's long association with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His observation of how the city is turning into two separable halves , of privileged and slum areas , is evident in the way he maps the surroundings which belong to low income groups , which also happen to be an ethnic or religious minority . <p> The drawings on the wall are about the locality of small houses ; the bathtub containing the black liquid is about a drain cutting through a populated neighbourhood . The insertion of the tree may be read as a tongue-in-cheek comment upon the condition of a community that celebrates its rituals , amid fears of religious extremism and in the face of extreme poverty . <p> In a sense , the murkiness at the gallery has nothing to do with the situation of the poor nor is it only about a religious community but it is the state of the larger majority which has descended into this darkness . <p> Apart from these obvious readings which could be misleading -- since all obvious interpretations prove to be deceptive -- the work suggests something different too . In a way , John 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and art circles . Interestingly , the drawings of houses are an attempt to bring the real world into the realm of art . These could be part of an attempt to subvert the exclusive sphere of art and convert the sacredness of gallery into a banal and usual setting . <p> The site-specific installation serves to blend the gallery interior with transitory imagery ; the architecture of gallery is connected with the layout of buildings drawn and is enhanced by the play of light , since the shadows cast on empty walls seem to complete the ambience of an ordinary area . <p> The choice of material -- black crayon -- increases the effect of shadows . At some point , one starts getting the feeling of being in the area -- away from the physical location of the gallery , experiencing the streets with open drains , exposed electricity wires and depilated houses . <p> Another shock which takes one away from one 's safe viewing position is to find no works on ' display ' . Despite the fact that the walls are covered with images , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung or dismantled or stored after being purchased . <p> This aspect of Julius John 's art is a comment on the growing art market which transforms and reduces an artist 's creative output into a commodity . He defies this notion of product and the procedure of selling and purchasing art which , for many individuals , has become the sole purpose for making art . On the contrary , the purpose of an exhibition is sharing of an experience . <p> More than any other thing , the two bathtubs as symbols of dirty sewerage are a comment on the situation of Christians in this country . For multiple reasons , the concept of dirt and cleaning has been associated with this religious minority , which renders it almost untouchable for the Muslim majority . The bathtub levelled with tar like substance , signifying the city 's ganda naala , as explained by the curator Seher Tareen , denotes the task or fate of local Christian community as cleaners . While the upside bathtub with the plastic tree appears like a grave and reminds the vulnerable position of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carnage of Joseph Colony and the killings at the Peshawar Church are a just a few recent reminders . <p> There can be several formal reasons for the artist 's decision to use only black but when compared with the imagery , that is mainly of dusk and the quote from the bible on the invitation card " ... and darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon , for the sun stopped shining . ( Luke 23:44,45 ) " , one empathises with the reason behind the various layers of darkness . The darkness may refer to the forces of bigotry that are spreading and gaining power in our surroundings . <p> In a sense , the murkiness at the gallery has nothing to do with the situation of the poor nor is it only about a religious community but it is the state of the larger majority which has descended into this darkness at noon without a way out . <p> The show will continue till Jan 15 , 2013 , at Rohtas 2 in collaboration with P.S.

@@4615239 <h> Pakistan can become world 's 18th largest economy by 2050 <p> ISLAMABAD - Pakistan has the potential to become 18th largest economy of world by 2050 , leaving behind many strong economies , according to Jim O'Neill , a British economist.Jim O'Neill is famous for coining the term BRIC - Brazil , Russia , India and China in 2001 , analyzing their potential to become world 's powerful economies.Now he has come up with a new term MINT - Mexico , Indonesia , Nigeria and Turkey , projecting their economies to see the strong growth in the coming decades.According to his projections for 2050 , Pakistan would become the 18th largest economy in the world by 2050 with a GDP of US$ 3.33 trillion ( almost the same size as the current German economy ) . Currently , Pakistan stands at the 44th largest economy in the world with a GDP of US$ 225.14 billion .

Something else three of them share , which Mexican Foreign Minister Jose Antonio Meade Kuribrena pointed out , is that they all have geographical positions that should be an advantage as patterns of world trade change.For example , Mexico is next door to the US , but also Latin America . Indonesia is in the heart of South-east Asia but also has deep connections with China . And Turkey is in both the West and East.Nigeria is not really similar in this regard for now , partly because of Africa 's lack of development , but it could be in the future if African countries stop fighting and trade with each other.This might , in fact be the basis for the MINT countries developing their own economic-political club just as the BRIC countries did - one of the biggest surprises of the whole BRIC thing.This was something the charismatic Nigerian finance minister , Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala was keen to talk about : " We know our time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are missing something by not having us . " Mexican Economist Meade Kuribrena went so far as to suggest that , as a group of four countries , the Mints have more in common than the Brics . " I am not sure about that , but it is an interesting idea , " he said.Economically three of them - Mexico , Indonesia and Nigeria - are commodity producers and only Turkey is n't . This contrasts with the BRIC countries where two - Brazil and Russia - are commodity producers and the other two - China and India - aren't.In terms of wealth , Mexico and Turkey are at about the same level , earning annually about $10,000 ( 6,100 ) per head . This compares with $3,500 ( 2,100 ) per head in Indonesia and $1,500 ( 900 ) per head in Nigeria , which is on a par with India . They are a bit behind Russia - $14,000 ( 8,500 ) per head - and Brazil on $11,300 ( 6,800 ) , but still a bit ahead of China - $6,000 ( 3,600 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country needs more of a sense of commercial purpose beyond commodities , and has to improve its infrastructure.In Turkey , visits to white goods manufacturer Beko and Turkish Airlines , the world 's fastest growing airline , definitely made me go " Wow " , and in Nigeria , I was saying it all the time.Sorting out energy policy was seen in both Mexico and Nigeria as a top priority and each country has launched a major initiatives this year , which if implemented , will accelerate growth rates significantly.In Indonesia , the fourth largest country in the world , leadership and infrastructure were the major challenges , though there were many more too . But challenges and opportunities sit side by side.In one of Jakarta 's slum areas , Pluit , the land is sinking by 20cm per year because of over-extraction of water , but property prices elsewhere in the city are rocketing.So , according to the BBC , the Mints can join the top 10 largest economies in the world , though it may take 30 years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

@@4622230 @ @ @ @ @ @ parliamentary election held on January 5 , 2014 , several articles have appeared in the national dailies . There were many divergent views -- some have justified holding the election for the sake of constitutional reasons and argued that a bad election was still better than no election . Others point out that the election fell short of democratic standards and failed to reflect the verdict of the people . There was disagreement on the number of people who cast votes -- the estimates varied from five to 20 percent . The president , the prime minister , the speaker and the chief election commissioner were amongst the people who either could not or did not vote . The leader of the opposition was interned and could not cast her vote either . By any standards , this latest parliamentary election held in Bangladesh was unique . Civil society and the international community rejected the outcome of the election . They demanded fresh elections as early as possible in order to not derail Bangladesh 's democratic trajectory.Prior to the parliamentary election the ruling coalition realised that the turnout of voters would be low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heavyweights of the ruling party became unhinged at the boycott of the election in 52 polling centres in Dhaka where hardly a voter was seen during polling hours . Driven by the desire to not be isolated at home and abroad , the leaders of the ruling party suggested that the government would be open to discussing the election . Over time there has been a shift in the mindset of the leadership . Now they are dismissing any dialogue and have reiterated their resolve to complete their five year term . The Jatiya Party ( JP ) , which has suffered from both moral and political bankruptcy , now forms an integral part of the ruling coalition as well as of the opposition . Though JP is both in the government as well as the opposition , its presence is not felt in either . There was unprecedented violence preceding the election . Activists of the right wing Jamaat-e-Islami formed the strike force . Its senior leaders were imprisoned and facing trials . Some of them were awarded death sentences for crimes committed during the 1971 liberation war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activists were in all-out confrontation with the law enforcement agencies . On the other hand , the brutal response by the law enforcement agencies against the activists made them even more desperate and added a new dimension to the violence . Though the Bangladesh Nationalist Party ( BNP ) opposed the election held under the incumbent government , it was not clear whether it had sanctioned such a high level of violence . The consequences were however far reaching ; trade and commerce came to a halt , the transportation system was severely disrupted and civic life was totally paralysed . Following the election , for obvious reasons , this level of pressure could not be maintained and normalcy was gradually restored . The government characterised the ' return to normalcy ' as a rejection by the people of opposition-sponsored violence.The government took advantage of relative peace and began consolidating its position . India was quick to accord recognition to the new government . One Indian daily drew parallels between the January 5 elections and the election held in Punjab in 1989 where the Akali Dal secured no more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Bangladesh as a constitutional obligation , but other dailies castigated New Delhi for being too supportive of the ruling coalition . Members of the international community including the US and European countries also accorded recognition to the new government but remained firm in their demands for an early , all-inclusive participatory election . The new government claims that the international community has accepted its legitimacy . This is far from the truth . As long as diplomatic relations are not severed , diplomats of foreign countries will continue to do business with the host government but at a minimum level . The US ambassador has unequivocally said his country 's relationship with Bangladesh is far from being normal.Hardly had the ' spite ' of convoluted parliamentary elections begun to fade than the government decided to hold the upazilla ( sub-district ) elections in order to gain political mileage . The ruling party leadership calculated that the BNP was in disarray and would not reverse its decision to participate in the local elections . The prediction failed and opposition parties led by the BNP endorsed candidates at the local election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ February 19 and 27 marked a significant victory for the BNP . Its nominees won 101 upazilla chairman posts as against 79 by the Awami League . On vice-chairman posts , the BNP scored 60 as against 52 by the ruling party . On ' women vice-chairman ' posts , the BNP won 78 as against 60 by the ruling party . JP put up a dismal performance and fell far behind the Jamaat-e-Islami . It remains to be seen how the remaining three phases of local elections are held . The opposition parties and civil society have expressed foreboding about heavy-handedness by ruling party candidates.The outcome of the local elections has provided a much needed boost to the BNP but it is still not well equipped to launch a mass movement to destabilise the government . Its leadership should now take pause and evaluate its strategy . It should take a critical look at how its agitation was perceived by the people and how it should conduct itself in future . The BNP 's record of mass outreach , its continued boycott of parliament and failure to articulate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It could not defend its own ' caretaker formula ' when it was tabled in parliament . Calling on the government to resign a few months after it formed , lack of interest in interacting with government counterparts , and asking for more seats in the front rows of parliament exposed the political bankruptcy of the party . The central working committee has failed miserably to provide guidance to its workers . The party needs overhauling from the central committee down to district levels with the induction of young and committed acolytes.The BNP should not fall prey to the provocations of the ruling party . Instead , it should focus on drafting strategies on how to promote bilateral relations with India , develop strategy for future interim governments to oversee general elections , the reconstitution of the Election Commission and Anti-corruption Commission , depoliticisation of the bureaucracy and police , promotion of rule of law and retrenchment of corruption in society . People are no longer keen for one party to simply replace another . They would prefer to see a comprehensive manifesto outlining future economic , trade and external @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zia still enjoys huge popularity . She should begin visiting outlying districts and inspire young acolytes and leaders about the goals of the party . The leadership should also pay attention to the practice of democracy within the party . Dictatorship in the party promotes party dictatorship in the country . The present crisis in the country is largely the result of one-person rule in the ruling as well as in the opposition parties . Anathema for dictatorship should be practiced at all layers of political organisations . Bangladesh deserves nothing less than popularly elected secular , progressive and forward looking government . 
@@4622232 <h> Symbol of federation <p> One unintended consequence of the Eighteenth Amendment perhaps is that the 139 year old prestigious art institution known as the National College of Arts is now struggling to stay as a symbol of federation . The rumour that the institution will be devolved to Punjab has drawn a strong reaction from everybody affiliated with it . <p> After the Eighteenth Amendment was unanimously passed by the parliament in April 2010 , many ministries and departments were devolved to the provinces including the education ministry which was constitutionally the parent department of NCA since 1972 . <p> The biggest reservation on the proposed devolution of NCA is that it would ruin the " federal character " of the institution , referring to the quota system put in place here . " In a federal institution , students have a rightful claim on the quota . Even if the Punjab government decides to retain it in some manner , it will be more as a charity and not as right , " says a senior teacher . <p> As per the defined quota , each degree course includes 50 per cent students from Punjab , 20 per cent from Sindh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from FATA and AJK , seven per cent from Balochistan , and three per cent from GB . Currently , the total degree-course strength of NCA is around 1200 ; this means no less than 600 of them represent different regions other than the Punjab . <p> People say that all art institutions established in the country have been initiated by the alumni of the NCA . It is known as " the mother of all art institutions " in Pakistan . <p> Following the Eighteenth Amendment , NCA 's control was handed over to the Inter Provincial Coordination Ministry and was then given to the Cabinet Division . After the abolition of Education Ministry at the federal level , the chairman Board of Governors of NCA is none other than the prime minister himself . <p> The college itself is determined to remain with the federal government . It is a desire shared by the students , staff and thousands of alumni of the college serving at important places in different spheres of life . <p> In a meeting organised by the Inter Provincial Coordination Ministry to discuss devolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the concerned additional secretaries of Cabinet Division told the ministry they would have no objection if the Lahore and Rawalpindi campuses of NCA were devolved to the Punjab province . <p> A short history of NCA <p> NCA was established as the Mayo School of Art in 1875 , along with LahoreMuseum , with the intention to have a centre that served the requirements of the museum by preserving and patronising the crafts of Punjab . This was twenty four years after the Great Exhibition of 1851 in London . <p> John Lockwood Kipling was made the curator of the LahoreMuseum and principal of the Mayo School of Arts . His vision and genuine regard for indigenous art allowed the crafts of the region to sustain at a time when they were under siege in industrialised Britain . <p> In 1958 , the MayoSchool was restructured by the Government of Pakistan as National College of Arts . Professor Mark Ritter Sponenburg ( 1916-2012 ) , an expert in art and design education and a great agent of change , was made the principal . In 1963 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a Board of Governors was formed under the provincial education ministry till 1972 , after which it became a federal institution . It also had quota of East Pakistan till then . <p> In 1985 , the college was granted a degree awarding status . In 1999 , NCA started a two years Masters in Visual Arts and in mid 2011 the then Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani announced to give NCA a federal university status . <p> The Cabinet Division policy is kind of contradictory as it allows some other institutions and organisations to remain with federal government , a document available with The News on Sunday reveals . The secretary held that Tobacco Control Cell , another unit under federal government , could not be devolved to the provinces due to its " international obligations " . Provinces would have to arrange funds for the institutions transferred to them , the document reads . <p> Importantly , the federal government as a policy to patronise art and culture has already taken the decision not to devolve Lok Virsa and Pakistan National Council of Arts ( PNCA ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following the decisions of Inter Provincial Coordination Ministry , a few weeks back , sought the opinion of NCA on budgetary matters , assuming that it would be taking over the college in the coming days . At the same time , according to some reports , the Prime Minister of Pakistan Mian Nawaz Sharif in a recent meeting has given the commitment that the institution shall not be devolved . However , it is said to be just a verbal commitment and nothing formal or written . <p> People who are in favour of retaining it in the federal domain say that all art institutions established in the country , whether in public or private sector , have been initiated by the alumni of the NCA . It is known as " the mother of all art institutions " in Pakistan . The continuation of its present status as a " national institution " shall provide an example to be emulated in the desire to achieve excellence in arts education . <p> " We are not keen to take over the NCA . We do n't want to intrude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mahmood Khan , secretary of Punjab government 's Higher Education Department . " We are only following the minutes of the Cabinet Division and Inter Provincial Coordination Ministry meeting . " <p> Mahmood says the department has also sought NCA 's opinion on the subject and nothing is final yet . " The final decision would be taken by the Punjab chief minister . " <p> The student body , representing the entire Pakistan and comprising extremely diverse socio-economic backgrounds , ethnic identities , ideological positions , languages and cultural traditions is the hallmark and strength of NCA . The students , staff and alumni of NCA are deeply concerned about the news of the college being devolved to the province . They are opposed to this move . They feel that institutions take time to develop and reach a certain standard of excellence . An already established institution like NCA , developing on the foundations laid over more than a century ago and in line with its charter as a national centre of excellence , provides equal opportunity for students from varied backgrounds and various regions to be exposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr Murtaza Jafri only reiterates this when he says : " Students coming from different cultures across Pakistan as a result of quota system is the beauty of NCA . " He says these students are freely expressing themselves creatively on the best platform in the country and they are not dependent on any province for this . " Its federal character practically brings all cultures of Pakistan under one roof , " he says . <p> " As a federal institution , NCA can continue to serve as an example and become the nucleus for the development of other art institutions in the various regions of the country in the years to come , " says a senior teacher . <p> As the pool of talent in art education is rather limited , NCA has attracted the best talent in the form of faculty from all over the country . In a federal institution , students coming from all over the country do not feel beholden to any province when entering its portals ; rather consider it their very right . It does not hurt their dignity . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fusion of rich and diverse cultural traditions . They claim equal ownership and consider themselves to be stakeholders in the best institution that the majority province has to offer , thus overcoming any sense of deprivation or backwardness . <p> It should remain with the federal government and rather elevated to the status of a federal university . It can gradually become a springboard for launching similar institutions in other federating units of the country .

The situation was somewhat similar a century ago , when Colonel Brazier Creagh of the India army during his travels in this region in 1893-94 observed : " When we went to the frontier it was called ' Yaghistan ' ( plundering land ) ; it was a forbidden land ... it was impossible to go inside ; and if you did your bones would be left there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pakistani parliament yet the unchallenged voice from there is of Taliban , who claim to be the ' religious men ' bent upon the imposition of their brand of religious order throughout the country .

One argument is that the tribal power structure establishes the authority of Malik and not the Mulla . The other argument is that both are competing institutions which legitimize each other in the sense that Mullas approve the institutional authority of ' jirgas ' headed by the Maliks whereas the Maliks approve the role of Mullas as the ' social guardians ' of the society . <p> The authority of the Pakistani state is as limited there as was that of the colonial British power .

Those who feel aghast at the breaking of TV sets , burning of video shops or more serious corporal punishments today by the Taliban need to read scholar Sana Haroon 's seminal research entitled ' Frontier of faith ' to find out how the Mullas confiscated the valuables and burned the houses of those , who refused to bow to their religious edicts and political directives . To extend their power in the tribal lands of India and Afghanistan , they resisted tooth and nail the authority of the British and the Afghan states . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written by the ruler of Afghanistan , Amir Abdur Rahman to the British authorities in 1897 : " Just as in the old days of Europe the popes used to profess to be the sole disposers of heaven and hell , and the people accepted the word of worthless priests so too these Mullas claim to possess the same power .... For fourteen years they raised every part of Afghanistan against me ... till thousands of men perished on both sides ... " <p> The calls of ' jehad ' have echoed the tribal areas many a time . In their religious observance and in its promotion during the last two centuries , the Mullas of FATA have generally followed the Naqshbandiyya-Mujaddidya ' tariqa ' or method based on the teachings of Sheikh Ahmed Sirhindi also known as Mujaddad Alf Sani and his successors Shah Waliullah and Syed Ahmed Shaheed of Rai Bareli . Before martyrdom at the Battle of Balakot in 1831 , Syed Ahmed had developed a close relationship with Akhund Abdul Ghaffur of Swat and the latter had not only kept those ' mujahidin ' under his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shah Waliullah 's philosophy in the form of the ' Tariqa-i-Muhammadiyya ' movement that put emphasis on the strict observance of the word of the Quran and the authenticated Hadith . In the last quarter of the nineteenth century , Fazal Wahid known as Haji Sahib Turangzai went to Haj in the company of the ulema of Deoband and met Haji Imdadullah , a member of the so-called Wahabi Movement in Mecca and took ' bait ' to continue the mission of religious revivalism as espoused by Syed Ahmed of Bareli . <p> The British adopted a policy of carrot and stick to tackle them . To woo the tribesmen from the influence of Mullas , they propped up the Maliks as an alternative pillar of power through generous distribution of funds . How money works wonders became visible during World War II , when several hostile Mullas such as Mulla Powindah Fazal Din and Shewa Mulla declared open support to the British against the Germans ... <p> In this regard , the Mullas have shown a propensity to be manipulated by the outside forces . If the religious radicals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housing foreign militants , today ; it is just a case of history repeating itself . The ' Jamat-i-Mujhaidin ' sponsored by the ulema of Darul Uloom Deoband had sent hundreds and thousands of non-Pakhtun Mujahidin recruits from all over India into FATA which were trained and settled by the local Mullas , in particular Mulla Sandaki and Haji Turangzai , the latter is believed to have settled at least 120 families of the members of ' Jamat-i-Mujahidin ' . Funds and weapons began to flow into FATA from India and Afghanistan . In just six months , three thousand rupees and over three hundred rifles from India and about sixty thousand rupees from the Afghan government of Amir Habibullah were funneled for the realisation of the objective of ' Jamat-i-Mujahidin ' which according to Maulana Hussain Ahmed Madni , a top leader of Deoband was to kick out the British from the subcontinent by the attacks of a revolutionary army of ' mujahidin ' in which the tribesmen of Kalat and Makran were to attack Karachi , the recruits from Ghazni ( Afghanistan ) were to attack Quetta and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conspiracy was busted by the British but the Afghan governments continued to meddle in the Tribal Areas by supplying cash and weapons to the Mullas throughout the 1920s and ' 30s . For instance , it is on record that Babra Mulla , Mulla Chaknawar , Haji Turangzai and several others were sent pistols , rifles and cash for personal use as well as grants to perform Haj and build mosques and madrasas in FATA . <p> The British adopted a policy of carrot and stick to tackle them . To woo the tribesmen from the influence of Mullas , they propped up the Maliks as an alternative pillar of power through generous distribution of funds . How money works wonders became visible during World War II , when several hostile Mullas such as Mulla Powindah Fazal Din and Shewa Mulla declared open support to the British against the Germans whereas those , who continued to resist the government by armed ' lashkars ' and guerilla raids on state 's forces and installations were attacked on the ground and bombed from the air first by the Royal Air Force ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Pakistan Air Force ( PAF ) in 1948 , particularly to quell the intransigent Faqir of Ipi in the Tochi Valley .

Every , government tries to attract the investors to invest their money for earning handsome profit in some safe various business fields . However , tendency of investment reveals that most of the Pakistani overseas preferring investment in Real Estate Business . The overseas investors consider that in Real Estate Business , early profit taking and safety of funds is much more as compared to the other businesses . But one has to invest at right time , at right place and in the reliable society . Therefore , while investing they prefer reputed and institutionalized society managed by some board rather than run by a single person . <p> Nevertheless , reputation of society in general public depends upon fraud free and fairness in the system of management . In this regard , we can say that it is only possible in the institutionalized societies like DHA , WAPDA , Police , Punjab Housing Society , Pakistan Housing Authorities , PAF and AWT rather than committing their finances in the societies headed by single individual , or trust consist of same family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Eden are running under the direction of a single executive . The point of concern here is that what will happen to these societies , in case their top most executives encounter with any mishap since all authorities lies with him . Whereas in institutionalized societies the management keeps on changing in due course of time and no policy change can take place on replacement or leaving of its some staff . Moreover , the person occupying the office normally tries to prove better from his predecessor and implement the policies . <p> For example , DHA Lahore 's team under the leadership of present management has launched various public interests projects and took steps in construction of new road , establishing medical centre , quick and rapid system of transfer of plots , paying reasonable amounts to the investors and running efficiently and effectively education institutions for normal and special children . Here it is also mentionable that Lt General Naveed Zaman , President of DHA Lahore despite his commitment as Corps Commander is regularly chairing the meetings of the board , supervises DHA affairs for taking steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system . <p> In fact media has played a very positive role in saving people from investing their money in irrupted housing schemes . At the same time , media is also exposing those owners who played games with the innocent people while grabbing their money and lands . Recently , TV programme " Khara Sach " with Mubashir Lucman regarding " Eden Housing Scam Fraud " has been aired by ARY News Talk Show on 13th February 2014 . The host of the programme stated some horrible facts about Eden Housing and plot schemes . According to him , Eden Housing Schemes due to the overbooking has failed to comply with the promises of provision of plots in time to its allotees . <p> Meanwhile , my brother in law visited and stated that he has almost nearer to complete final installments of land but still no plot or house been allotted to him by the administration of Eden Housing Society . The administration keeps on promising the allotment of plots since 2006 . It is a common practice that some of the societies do announce the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some other purpose . Thus , the societies ' owners fraudulently make money while deceiving innocent public . Many people have become victims due to illegal and fraudulent activities of the land grabbers . <p> I do remember that in 2005 Bahria Town Islamabad without acquisition of land has announced Phase IX . Thus ; perforce Management of the society after earning profit has merged it with their Phase 8 but astonished to learn that there is no such Phase IX on ground . It means that owners of both these organizations must have earned a profit millions of rupees while keeping masses of money in their accounts . <p> It is worth mentioning here that balloon of Bahria Town is getting punctured and the house of cards is crumbling . The anti corruption unit has submitted its report to the Supreme Court and the report says that the Malik Riaz and his son Ali Riaz is involved in the land scandal and the whole project of Bahria Town is a scam . The media reports also confirmed that 1401 acre land was acquired through fake documents in Rawalpindi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Qabza group . <p> In this connection one affectees of Bahria Town , Muhammad Khalid on October 6th , 2011 has applied for 10 Marla plot in extension 8 Rawalpindi so now we are waiting for SC decision . <p> Another victim of Bahria Town , Mr.Fawad Khan stated on October 8th , 2011 , Malik Riaz is 100% unbelievable , Fawad further revealed that many persons around Rawat , Humak , Sihala and South-Eastern Rawalpindi are available to narrate the sad tales of being deprived of land by force due to this gang . But due to his close association with political heads and Judges , he can not be touched . <p> Concluding , I would say that Real Estate business can be flourished , if the lords of this sector ready to eliminate fraud , provide secure environment to its inhabitants , abide by their promises , establishing authoritative board rather than giving executives posts to its family members and proper registration of the housing societies under company acts . <p> The writer cam be approached through zameer36@gmail.com <h> What do you think about the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Your Comments : * <p> Your Name : * <p> E-mail ( Optional ) : <p> City ( Optional ) : <p> Country ( Optional ) : <p> Field marked(*) are mandatory .

But that 's when you need to relax and get your wits together . An engagement ring is that one piece of jewellery that she is going to wear for the rest of her life , be it a wedding , a dinner or just a casual zoo trip ; she will be carrying it everywhere she goes . Keeping that in mind , you must pick something that she can carry off with ease and comfort , something she would want to flaunt wherever she goes .

Does she like simple and sleek or does she like traditional and old school ? What kind of jewellery does she normally wear ? Is it more towards gold or silver , does she like big diamonds or exquisite gems ? Is it simple or chunky ? It 's essential to know about her style when buying the ring because it will be close to what she already has in mind . At the end all you want is to make her really happy . Do n't you ?

If she is heavier , larger boned or taller , her ring size is probably in the 6 1/2 to 7 1/2 range . It 's always better to buy a ring a bit bigger than you think she 'll need , because sizing a ring down is much easier than increasing its size.There are an unending variety of patterns , details and metal choices when you are buying the engagement ring .

@@4626235 <h> Tribute to literature <p> Literature owes its pioneers for all inspirations taken . It always remembers those architectural experiments , which begin in delight and ends in wisdom . Even the followers of a particular trait are respected but the status of the inventors remains supreme . The domain of poem saying gets similar treatment in the Western , Chinese , Persian , Urdu and Arabic languages and culture . Ironically the pioneers of Nasari ( prose ) Poem have not been yet accepted with open arms in Urdu literature . Baudelaire ( French ) , Mallarme , Hoshi ( Chinees ) , Nima Yushig ( Persian ) , Tagore ( Bengali ) , Mira Ji ( Pakistan ) and Badar Shakir Alsiyab(Arabic) have given respect to their poems in their respective languages . Arabic Poems were born in Mesopotamia and its style remained close to ' Nazm e Aazad ' right from the beginning . The students of literature and history are aware that like Yellow River Civilization , the poets used the metaphors of the civilization close to Tigiris and Ephurates Rivers reflecting fertility that exists in its agriculture . Poet Badar Shakir Al-Siyaab was born in village Jekore ( Basra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matan Maut " ( the title of the book under review ) was born in Babul City . The Arabic poetry therefore encompasses this river-city culture and Arabic poets discovered new symbols for their poetry that depicts their psyche . They therefore did a dialogue with the rivers in the poetry and created outstanding pieces of poetry . This reviewer shall quote just one example of such poetry . Its title is ' Baaham Ik Bister Par ' ( together in bed ) ( Page 119 ) . It says ' Dhara Hei/Mere Dayen Haath Pei Ik Samunder/Bayein Haath Pei Maut/Thak Jaaun Tau/Dayein Haath Pei Maut/Samunder Bayein Pei Rakh Laita Hun/Jab Sota Hun/Tau Bister Par Mere Hamrah Samunder Sota Hei/Par Maut Nahi Hota/Woh Mere Saanson Ko Ginti Ginti/Pehra Daiti Hei/Mere Janib Takde Chale Jaati Hei/Jab Mere Bister Pei/Woh Laiti Hoti Hei ' . ( There is a sea/I carry with my right hand/there is a death/I carry with my left hand/when I get tired/I put the sea on my left hand/and the death on my right hand/when I sleep the sea sleeps restful beside me on the bed/ but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me with suspicion and doubt/ lying beside me as well as the bed ) . <p> Al-Siyaab has used Buwayb River , Qabani has used city Damascus , Adonis has used River Nile in their dialogues . Adeeb Kamal was born in Babul City . Even in Urdu Literature Babul City is a familiar metaphor . <p> Here one issue needs to be laid emphasis upon . That is independence of Urdu Nazm . It is not obligated to Arabic or Ajami tradition . The style of saying modern Urdu , Farsi and Arabic free verse took birth almost simultaneously . The words ' Azad Nazm ' took its name from the word ' Azad ' from Persian language and ' Nazm ' from the Arabic language . Urdu itself is outcome of a combination of various cultures emanating from the sub-continent soil . Modern Urdu Nazm has not followed the traditional route that has been followed by Urdu Ghazal . Its origin is different in the three languages . That is why their respective styles are different . Arabic poem holds a special place in all the languages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combination of vocabulary , experiences and treatment . No other language has been blessed with so many poets saying free verse as is available to this language . This group is led by Adonis , Adeeb Kamal ud Din ( Iraq ) , Muhammad Alfitory ( Sudan ) , Abdullah Alriyami ( Oman ) , Riyan Alchakaki ( Syria ) , Wada Saadi ( Lebanon ) , Khalid Mattawa ( Libya ) , Qasim Haddad ( Bahrain ) , Alsadiq Alrazi ( Sudan ) , Fatima Naout ( Egypt ) , Faliha Hasan ( Iraq ) , Adnan Alsami ( Kufa ) , Faiz Alhamdani ( Iraq ) , Fatina Alghara ( Palestine ) , Adeeb Kamal Uddin ( Iraq ) . Another generation came into existence in 1990s . Once Ali Ahmad Alseer Adonis ( spending time in exile in Paris ) was asked as to why he did not write what masses understood . He quoted the saying of Abu Tamam " why do n't you understand what he said " . His thesis was that the world was created to debate on an issues and question them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poem ' New York Ka Janaza ' ( The funeral of New York ) as ' Zameen Ki Tasveer/Nashpati Jaisi Tasveer/Ya Aurat Kei Gol Paire Ki Tarha/Phalon Aur Maut Kei Darmayan/New York/Engineering Ka Aik Shoabda Hei/Usse Chaar Taangon Wala Sheher Kaho/Jo Qatl Par Amada Hei ' ( Earth 's picture is like a pear or like a round wheat ball before flattened for making a bread . Between fruits and death , New York is an engineering feat , ready to kill ) . <p> The book titled ' Matan Dar Matan Maut ' by Iqtidar Javed is an attempt to introduce Arabic free verse poets to Urdu literature readers . The translation of poetry is the most difficult and challenging task for every translator . Translation is to make an art from art , maintaining the aesthetic value of the work . Robert Frost once described poetry as ' what gets lost in translation ' . Its a process from translation skills to mastering poetic structure , form , revising and editing.Keeing in view the complexity of translation activity , one can easily understand that only a poet can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writer and translator Eghishe charents is widely accepted , who is sure that a poem is to be translated by a poet.Iqtidar not only accepted this challenge but proved to be a poet of diversified experiences and expressions . <p> Its title takes inspiration from one of Adeeb Kamal 's poem ' Tum Kis Tarha Marna Chaho Gei/Jaise/Parinda/Khuda Ki Zameenon Mein Gum Ho Jata Hei/Jaise Machli Khuda Kei Samunder Main Gum Ho Jati Hei/Aur Parinda/Khuda Kei Samunder Sei Machli Utha Laita Hei ' ( well how will you die/if the bird gets lost in the hand of God/And ? / if the fish gets lost in the sea of Gods/And ? / if the bird picks up the fish/Amazing ) . Arabs are too familiar with deaths due to internal turmoil and external invasions . The Palestinian problem is too much imprinted in modern poets ' minds and reflected in their poems such as Mahmud Darwaish , Ibrahim Tokan , Ibrahim Nasarullah , Kamal Nasar , Sami Al-Qasim , Tahe Muhammad Ali , Abdul Aziz Al-Muqeela , Amjad Nasar , Nomi Shahab Nai , Izzuddin , Jehad Hadeeb , Ahmad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and alike . Iqtidar chose the book titled ' Tama Khata ' by Adeeb Kamal which is prose poetry . Iqtidar has tried to convert these poems in free verse , basically because of least interest of Urdu poetry lovers for this domain and secondly because of translator 's own choice to do so . He is grateful to Muhammad Saleem ur Rehman for his advice during translation and to Tauqir Ahmad Faiq and Ali Shehzad Tauqir for their advice too . The book contains forty one translated poems of Adeeb Kamal uddin.

@@4626239 <h> Legendary singer Ghulam Ali -- Part II <p> Singer Ghulam Ali avoided himself being called an ustad as he revealed during a show on PTV . This gesture simply indicated his humility . I know for one thing that Ghulam Ali is a very simple person . He avoids eating meat and naan ( baked bread ) . He likes simple chappati and shorba ( gravy ) . I was witness to it when I recorded his ghazals for Oriental Star Agencies ' ( Birmingham , UK ) album ' Khushboo ' at EMI Recording Studios , Lahore . ( I had the honour to render the same ghazals too ) . He mixes well with friends . He is a down to earth person , wears a simple dress and despite him crossing 70 , travels widely all over the world for his live concerts . Unlike his contemporaries he has managed his finances well . He told me that he is his own finance manager.Ghulam Ali has sung songs composed by many music composers of the subcontinent but he composes music also , especially ghazals . His compositions for the poet Nasir Kazmi need special mention . His ghazal " Dil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PTV and composed by Altaf Hussain ( late ) was also rendered by a female singer Tasawur Khanum for a programme in , which both male and female singers used to sing the same ghazal , disclosed Ghulam Ali . This number was an instant hit and later Ghulam Ali started rendering it as a solo item in most of his concerts both at home and abroad . His variations on the word ' leher ' ( wave ) through different combination of notes used to establish many shades of waves ; quiet and noisy . This craftsmanship used to mesmerise the audience and establish his command on tune , words and rhythm . One of such performances of this ghazal was part of PTV 's show ' Meri Pasand ' ( My choice ) produced by Khwaja Najamul Hasan in early 1980s . Though Ghulam Ali has rendered most of the ghazals composed by his assistant Rafique Hussain , his compositions are raag-based and sometimes include a scientific mixture of raags . The music lovers must be aware that a raag is a scientific , precise , subtle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement consisting of either a full seven note octave , or a series of six or five notes ( or a combination of any of these ) in a rising or falling structure called the ' Arohi ' and ' Amrohi ' . I had observed that Ghulam Ali uses his training of singing thumri in most of his renderings and plays with the rhythm , being a rhythm master himself . Sometimes he uses a ' bedaar ' ( odd ) note only to return to the original scale with ease beautifying his composition and performance . The other scion using this quality was legendry singer late Tufail Niazi . The result is touching the hearts of music lovers . Some of the examples that can vouch for this observation are " Aae husne lala faam " , " Apne dhun mai reheta hun mai bhi tere jaisa hun " , " Apni tasveer ko aankhon se " , " Arze gham say bhi faida tou nahain " , " Ye dil yei pagal dil mera kyun bujh gaya awaargi " ( Poet : Muhsin Naqvi ) , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raja " ( thumri ) , " Chamakte chand ko tuta hua tara bana dala " , " Chhup chhupa ke piyo " , " Chupke chupke raat din ansoo bahana yaad hei " ( Poet : Hasrat Mohani ) , " Dil buk buk ahro " , " Dil jala ke mera muskuraate hain woh " , " Dil dharakne ka sabab yaad aaya " ( Poet : Nasir Kazmi ) , " Dil mein ik leher si uthi hai abhi " ( Poet : Nasir Kazmi ) , " Fasle aise bhi honge yei kabhi socha na tha " , " Hadaffe gham na kiya sange mallamat nay mujhay " ( Poet : Raees Warsi ) , " Heer " ( for Pakistani film ' Heer Ranjha ' composed by Khwaja Khurshid Anwar ) , " Hum tere shehr mein aye hain " , " Hum to kitno ko mehzabeen kehte hain " , " Humko kiske gham ne mara yei kahani phir sahi " ( Poet : Masroor Anwar ) , " Hungama hai kyon barpa " ( Poet : Akbar Allahabadi ) , " Itni muddat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hansi " ( Produced by Khalid Asghar ) , " Kabhi naiki mein mujhe " , " Kachhi deewar hoon " , " Kesi chali hai abke hawa " , " Kal chaudhvin ki raat thi " ( Poet : Ebne Insha ) , " Kal raat bazm mein jo mila " , " Kehte hai mujhse ishq ka afsana chahiye " ( Poet : Qamar Jalalabadi ) , " Khuli jo aankh " , " Khushbu gunche talash karti hain " , " Khushbu jese log " , " Kina kina timro tasveer " , " Kiya hai pyaar jise " , " Koi humnafas nahi hai " , " Main nazar se pee raha hoon " ( Poet : Qamar Jalalvi ) , " Mehfil mein baar baar " ( Poet : Agha Bismil ) , " Mera kya tha tere hisaab mein " , " Ni chambe diye band kaliye " ( film song ) .

It took the issue to the United Nations , with Sindh-Taas Agreement between India and Pakistan ; United Nations resolved the water issue.One of the points of agreement was that in need , India or Pakistan could build a dam upon these rivers . India started building dams without informing Pakistan . Pakistan got worried when Wular Lake barrage disrupted the flow of water into Jhelum River , which flows into Pakistan because the capacity of the Wular Lake barrage is 3.0MAF while according to the proviso of Indus Water Treaty , to construct an ' incidental storage capacity ' the design has to be examined and approved by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceed 0.1 MAF of water on the other.The Wullar Lake is situated in the Indian occupied Jammu and Kashmir and River Jhelum flows into the lake .

For Pakistan the main worry was the barrage on that site , which could jeopardize and damage the three canal system consisting of Upper Jhelum Canal , Upper Chenab Canal and Lower Bari Doab Canal.Pakistan has been asking India to provide information about its projects at the planning stage , but India never does , even though it was bound to do so under the Indus Water Treaty .

In case the water flow is hindered Pakistan will fall victim to scarcity and paucity . Pakistan is in need of water to fulfill its agriculture demand . If water flow of these rivers is stopped then our agricultural land would become barren as Pakistan is already short of water .

@@4635232 <p> The writer is a retired lieutenant general of the Pakistan Army and served as chairman of the Pakistan Ordnance Factories Board <p> Twenty- five years ago in 1989 , Professor Francis Fukuyama of Stanford wrote the famous essay " The End of History " , which he recalls in his recent article in TheWall Street Journal as " the process of economic and political modernisation was leading not to communism , as the Marxists had asserted and the Soviet Union had avowed , but to some form of liberal democracy and a market economy . History , I wrote , appeared to culminate in liberty : elected governments , individual rights , an economic system in which capital and labour circulated with relatively modest state oversight . " Looking back he says : " The year 2014 feels very different from 1989 . " Not only are authoritarian countries becoming more authoritative and many countries like Thailand have suffered a military coup , and " Turkey , Sri Lanka and Nicaragua have been backsliding into authoritarian practices " . In the end , he , however , concludes that the " underlying idea remains correct " . Implying , thereby , that democracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in the realm of ideas , moreover , liberal democracy still does n't have any real competitors " . And even the Chinese model that is politically authoritarian can not compete with liberal democracy , as it is dependent on continuous economic growth that is unsustainable in the long-term . <p> He brought out in the same article how electoral democracies have proliferated from 35 in 1974 to 120 in 2013 . And even dictatorships such as those in Egypt or Venezuela would like to legitimise themselves under the cover of elections , however fraudulent these may be . <p> With Achakzai warning us of ominous clouds hovering over democracy , we need to take stock of our state of democracy and the dangers that it faces due to the machinations of Tahirul Qadri and his collaborators at home . In any case , for a country to be reminded of a possibility of a military takeover is the most debilitating experience . <p> The future of democracy in Pakistan will largely depend on how political parties evolve and politicians conduct themselves in coming years . A major factor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of governance . And what we are experiencing is that both at the provincial and federal level our political leadership has seriously neglected governance . <p> The PPP seems to have been really orphaned after the assassination of Benazir Bhutto . Although during its heyday the party was never known for running an efficient administration , even judging from its past standards there was steep decline in the performance of the last PPP governments both at the centre and in the two provinces where they were in power . The type of leadership provided by Asif Zardari is neither helpful in running the affairs of the government nor leading a political party . Retaining power within a small coterie of loyalists results in merit being compromised . This approach marginalises the best in the PPP . By setting low standards of governance and compromising on principles during the last five years in office , the PPP destroyed the party 's ethos .

Bilawal surely should be given a place of eminence provided he fulfills the criteria on merit . Although the PPP election manifesto for the 2013 elections spelled out fairly ambitious goals , the style and substance of governance bears hardly any relation to it . The party , to regain its position , will have to revive its organisation and cadres in Punjab , K-P and Balochistan and bring about a qualitative change in governance in Sindh . <p> The PML-N 's performance in Punjab is clearly better when compared to the other provinces , but at the federal level , its performance has many shortcomings .

This indecisiveness , had it continued , could have been a dangerous prelude to Nawaz Sharif finding himself on the wrong side of both the military and militants . His government also can not remain an idle spectator to the indiscriminate killing of Shias and other minorities . <p> Building metros and highways is fine and the country needs to develop its infrastructural facilities . But if these are built with Chinese assistance and Saudi benevolence and not by generating wealth from within by widening the tax base , then the country has a problem . <p> The PTI 's current strategy appears to concentrate more on developing street power than on governance in K-P .

But a time comes in the life of nations when leaders have to take tough decisions in the long-term interests of their people and the integrity of the state .

@@4635233 <h> Pakistani law and the role of media in curbing child labour <p> LAHORE : Millions of children are robbed of their childhood and are made to work , sometimes very dangerous jobs , in our country . The number of child labourers in Pakistan is estimated to be around 10 million , according to the International Labour Organisation ( ILO ) statistics , which is an alarming figure and what is more alarming is that the number is fast increasing . As a result of deterioration of socio-economic system and law and order , child labour has increased and emerged as a serious problem . The law of the land is very clear in this regard as constitution 's Article 11 ( 3 ) states : " No child below the age of 14 years shall be engaged in any factory or mine or any other hazardous employment . " Similarly , Article 25(A) clearly states : " The state shall provide free and compulsory education to all children of the age of five to sixteen years in such manner as determined by law " while Article 37(e) states : " The state shall make provision for securing just and humane conditions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in vacations unsuited to their age or sex , and for maternity benefits for women in employment . " The Employment of Children Act , 1991 , and the Employment of Children Rules , 1995 , exclusively deal with the subject of child labour.Despite presence of these laws , child labour is an increasing problem for the country and many children have to earn a living for their families and for them themselves by working long hours and taking up the risk of dangerous jobs . Children are our future but child labour is jeopardising the future of the country . Many things are needed to eliminate this evil practice , including poverty alleviation , education , advocacy campaigns and media awareness campaigns . No single institution , be it a government department , a non-government organisation ( NGO ) or the media , can tackle this issue single-handedly and concerted effort by all of the stakeholders and society as a whole are need of the hour.Undoubtedly , the media can help curb this inhumane practice through educating the people . As one of the basic roles of the media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces , the media has a duty to highlight the plight of children , who have to work instead of going to school.Our media has not remained successful in addressing various social issues , in which child labour is the most neglected area .

Recently , a high-power committee constituted by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif held a consultative conference on media 's code of conduct where this scribe had suggested that a percentage of daily media contents be fixed for development communication . And spreading awareness is perhaps the most required development communication in Pakistan.Our media has no indigenous entertainment for children ; all we get are Hindi-dubbed cartoon channels.By using the powerful medium of the media , child labour issue can be overcome and its hazardous effects can be communicated to the masses .

It is the media that can give a wake-up call to society and unite all of stakeholders . A good approach would be to get a joint campaign launched by all of stakeholders , including media groups , government , NGOs children and their parents .

There he met Bhutto and proceeded to hang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Meanwhile , Nuri Nutt gave birth to their second child . She named him Jeera Blade ( Gillette Razor ) . As Jatt lay rotting in jail , Nutt had to bring up their two sons all on her own . Sometimes when she could not earn enough money to feed and cloth her sons , she used to digress and commit theft by raiding the town 's shops with a home-made rifle . <p> She soon became notorious and the scared townsfolk began to inexplicably call her Hasina Atombum . Nutt wanted both of her sons to get a good education and become dentists . <p> Jeera was an obedient son and a hard-working student and always came second-last in his class . But Gullu did not take his studies seriously . He would spend most of his time painting a fake moustache with a thick black 2B pencil on his face and smashing watermelons on the Chaudhry 's farm . <p> Nuri Nutt : The crime-spree years . <p> After passing his matriculation ( in 3rd division ) , Jeera tried to join the Lahore police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer 's post in the Lahore police after the Chaudhry pulled some strings .

Instead , Gullu smashed the car of a small-time crook , an act that impressed a big-time crook who asked Gullu to join his gang . <p> The big-time crook was a gunrunner who smuggled in guns , drugs , rockets , grenades and Italian caviar from the Afghan border where he had connections with the anti-Soviet Afghan insurgents and some members of Zia 's government . <p> Once while Jeera was fleecing a milkman on a Lahore street and asking him to pay Rs.50 or face jail , he spotted Gullu smashing a brand new car .

She was recruited by PTI trolls . <p> Gullu continued to smash cars ( still just for the heck of it ) , but from 2005 onward he tried to give a semblance of meaning to his art by smashing cars and bikes during anti-US/India/Rwanda rallies and during protests against Pakistan 's gazillion enemies - especially Godzilla nurtured by famous Zionist scientist , Amrish Puri . <p> But , alas , this great artiste 's luck finally ran out when in June 2014 , while he was in the process of smashing his 5,000th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Record ) , some jealous folks claimed that he was one of the instigators of violence against the supporters of Canadian Moose-breeder , Tahir-ul-Kennedy . <p> Tahir-ul-Kennedy taking a leisurely walk outside his home in Canada . <p> Gullu was arrested and booked for injuring a Toyota car and then he was himself injured when he was attacked by a group of lawyers who were otherwise famous for showering rose petals on heroic killers . <p> Gullu 's fan-club , ' Gullu Kay Pathey ' , at once initiated a powerful campaign on Twitter against Gullu 's arrest with such hashtags : #JusticeForGullu ; #WeAreAllGulluToday ; #ButtHe'sInnocent ; and **25;99;TOOLONG . <p> This man is worse than an animal and we are encouraging him exactly the way we encouraged the killer of Salman Taseer .

The retail price of Indian Kesar is $30 per a 3kg pack while the world-renowned Alphonso mangoes are available in $35 per 3kg pack . <p> Currently , Mexican and other South American mango varieties are widely imported in the United States , along with Indian and Australian mangoes .

It is a misperception among the public and media persons that NAB makes some kind of agreement with the accused person to take back looted money and gives him ( the accused ) some relaxation . Even some senior media persons think that NAB does so but the reality is contrary to this . NAB or chairman NAB does not give any relaxation to the accused persons . The accused persons request a plea bargain under section 25 ( b ) of the National Accountability Ordinance ( NAO ) 1999 . When the accused person submits an application for a plea bargain to the chairman NAB , it is at the discretion of the chairman whether he accepts the application or not and when he accepts the application he refers the matter for approval to the Accountability Court . People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal procedure under the NAB law , wrongly criticise the bureau and the chairman . This incorrect impression needs to be corrected .

In addition to 15 percent fine , in the case of a government employee , he immediately loses his job forever and , if he is a non-government person or politician , he is barred from contesting elections for the next 10 years .

The top official should be man of integrity but he should ensure the compliance of rules and regulations at the Airlines on priority in order to make the Airlines functionally well.PIA management should consist of highly professional and dedicated employees who must be well-versed in the business of aviation implementing the policies to the grass root level effectively . " But unfortunately , it is not the case at present as majority of them do not have any background of aviation with no proper training and insight . " Currently , there are 18 directors , 40-45 general managers and 200 managers and their deputies for running an airline which is operating international and domestic flights with merely 15-17 aircrafts.He pinpointed the mismanagement at the Airline as barely two commercial flights have been carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrival on June 28 . However it is resting idle , making continuous losses of the Airline as it was rented on dry lease against $250,000 per month . " It happened because the management has not trained pilots for the newly inducted aircraft despite arrival of A320 . The plan was already delayed for more than two and half months . In this period , an ample number of captains could have been trained who could have operated maximum number of daily flights to utilize the aircraft optimally , " he said.Now what the management did was grossly incomprehensible for us . It grounded a series B737 aircrafts with no reason and their pilots as well . Besides , the pilots of A310 were stopped from flying in order to train them for A320 aircraft . Hence 42 pilots neither operated their previous aircraft nor the newly inducted or upcoming . " On the top of it , no fleet planning has been done by the management strangely when it was asked to provide them for the accommodation of pilots at available aircrafts . It shows the lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the Company 's rules of business , " PALPA president added .

@@4639232 <h> Enforcing respect by ordinance ? <p> The PML-N 's rise to power has brought back , to some extent , the straitjacket religiosity of General Zia 's dark years in power . The ministry of religious affairs , in the beginning of this Ramzan , was pleased draw the attention of the public to the ' Ehteram-e-Ramzan Ordinance 1981 ' ( the Respect of Ramzan Ordinance ) and remind the public that it was unlawful to eat , drink or smoke publicly during the holy month.The Ehteram-e-Ramzan Ordinance is one of the many incomprehensible laws that General Ziaul Haq 's unconstitutional and illegal regime inflicted upon Pakistan , which no one has dared to challenge on the touchstone of the constitution of Pakistan . It is a pointless law that has no precedent in Islamic history but perhaps is very similar to the Sabbath laws of Jews and Christians , which at one point enjoyed state sanction in many secular western nations including the US . Most of these states have since then repealed these laws or have made them redundant . The law states that any person who is under obligation to fast is not allowed to eat , drink or smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the first would be a person who is not under obligation i.e. a person who is either a non-Muslim , is sick , is elderly or is a woman who may be menstruating . However , the application of this law has more often than not targetted non-Muslims because , in practical terms , it is impossible to tell whether a person is ' under obligation ' to ' fast ' just by looking at the person . The second exception is for those people under obligation to not eat , drink or smoke in public . So , in other words , it is okay for a person under obligation to fast to eat , drink and smoke so long as he or she does it privately . Now the logical extension of this would be that a person not under obligation can eat , drink or smoke as he or she pleases . It goes without saying that this legal freedom is not honoured by the police who target the poorest of the poor in enforcing this law . It is quite the sight seeing labourers being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these extremely hot months of June and July . Then there is the obvious question of whether or not the state has any right , constitutionally , legally or morally to determine who is under an obligation to fast or not . Pakistan 's constitution , in terms of its relationship with Islam , is an enabling and not an enforcing constitution . The state is required to enable Muslims to live Islamic lives but not to force them to do so . No article of the constitution empowers the state to force people to pray , fast or live according to the injunctions of Islam . Hence the question of whether a person is under any obligation to fast or not is a matter between him and God , and not between the state and the citizen . When General Zia took over in 1977 , he introduced the myth that the objective of the Pakistani state was the Islamisation of culture and society . Himself a pious but simple Muslim , the Mard-e-Momin also tried very fervently to change Pakistan 's Independence Day from August 14 to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt to create a counterfactual narrative of the creation of Pakistan but one that has slowly and steadily taken root in the imagination of Pakistani people . As time has gone by , many Pakistanis have sought divine justification for Pakistan 's existence . Obviously , this has been achieved only by whitewashing history and sweeping under the carpet all inconvenient facts . For example , if Pakistan was created on 27th Ramzan , so was India . Tragically , those who wish to seek such spiritual reaffirmation of the country 's existence are up against the facts . On page 51 of the book The Aftermath of Partition in South Asia , a compilation by Gyanesh Kudaisya and Tan Tai Yong , we find the following account of the grand Independence Day gala at the Karachi Club on the night of August 15 , 1947 which needs to be quoted in full : " Jinnah arrived with his sister Fatima for the banquet .... They were led to the other guests , who included cabinet members , the diplomatic corps , the commander-in-chief , Sir Douglas Gracey , British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all resplendent in cummerbunds or dress suits with ladies in colourful saris and evening dresses . At the sit-down dinner around the teak dance floor , they were serenaded by Ken Mac and his band ... Sir Ghulam Hussain Hidayatullah requested Ken Mac to play So Deep Is the Night because on that Chopin tune . Ruttie had taken Jinnah 's consent for marriage in Bombay 's Taj Mahal Hotel , ballroom , at her birthday party , on February 20 , 1918 . Later the Quaid requested the orchestra for Paul Robson 's The End , which , as a courtesy to the Quaid , was sung in the tenor voice by the great Ken Mac himself , for it was known that the founder used to hum the words of The End on Thursday afternoons in Bombay that he devoted to visit the grave of his wife Ruttie , in the Khoja Shiite Isna'asheri cemetery of Bombay . The finale of the evening was given to the music ' Happy Birthday Dina ' because the Quaid had chosen the Independence Day of Pakistan on the birthday of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Bombay , with her two children Nusli and Diana . " Clearly , the father of the nation did not feel obligated by any religious observance while listening to Ken Mac 's band -- and to be sure there were many toasts in his honour on that night of 28th Ramzan . Whether he prayed tahajud later that night or rose early next morning for sehri is unknown . The time has come for the people of Pakistan and the government to realise that religious observance is a personal matter and not a policy one . It is time to bury General Ziaul Haq 's legacy with his remains at Faisal Mosque . The first step would be to scrap his illegal ordinances given cover by the eighth amendment .

DT : Carmudi is not operating in India and China , as they are the bigger markets in Asia ? Stefan : Of course they are the bigger markets , but look at the markets we are currently operating in , all of them are almost 1 billion in population size . Whereas in China and India there are already many companies in those markets and so there are less opportunities there and more in the markets we are currently operating in .

Those policies might affect dealers , but it does not affect us because we work as a bridge between buyers and sellers besides a platform for people buying and selling used cars . The gap in demand has to get filled by one way or another , whether it is through brand new cars , used cars or more reconditioned cars , but that gap will eventually get filled because the demand is there .

Based on holistic and natural therapies that cater to all issues , whether mental or physical , Arammish offers a fusion of healing techniques that have over the years been discarded or forgotten in lieu of allopathic treatments . The spa offers a diverse range of natural and organic therapies ranging from Ayurveda to aroma and even the little-known chromotherapy , which uses light in the form of colour to balance " energy " lacking from a person 's body . <p> The resounding success of Arammish and the fact that it is now the go-to beauty spot for Lahore 's socialites and celebs prove women 's willingness to embrace the natural , says Amna . " What sets Arammish apart from other salons and spas in the country is not only the variety of treatments we offer but also the fact that I 've tried my best to source as much material as I can locally . All my staff is Pakistani and trained to an international standard . I am personally against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and promoting every aspect of our country . Also , for our custom built salon near the FCC park in Gulberg , we opted for solar panels as our electrical source in order to remain as organic as we possibly could . " Amna strongly believes that the Arammish experience should mean all-encompassing well-being , hence the spa also offers health food options and an organic juice bar . So while you pamper yourself with a papaya facial or strawberry and cream hair mask , you can treat yourself guilt-free to a tuna salad sandwich or a platter of hummus with whole-wheat bread . <p> Zainab Abbas <p> 40-something Zainab Abbas is a Pilates instructor who also introduced the Route Two health supplement store in Lahore . One look at svelte Zainab is all that is required to convince anyone of the effectiveness of Pilates as the chosen form of exercise . The soft-spoken instructor fell in love with Pilates while vacationing abroad and felt a connection that has n't wavered since . She offers personal training sessions at her studio ( pricey , albeit worth the money ) while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Pilates with girls she has trained herself over the years . Named after its German inventor , Joseph H. Pilates , this form of exercise comprises of over 500 different controlled and precise movements designed to strengthen without adding bulk . <p> According to Zainab , Pilates is a great alternative for women who want to tone their body and strengthen their core without adding ungainly muscle or enduring endless hours of sweating at the gym . It is suitable for all ages and body types and Zainab swears by its effectiveness in weight loss , giving the example of a client who went from size 14 to 8 with just Pilates and a controlled diet . However , for Zainab the ideal body is neither waif-thin nor super muscular , but simply one that belongs to a calm and happy mind , free of any aches and pains and that is what she endeavours to achieve for all her clients . <p> Shehnaz Minallah <p> There is no denying the dynamic energy that resonates from Shehnaz Minallah , energy that even the most skeptical cynic ca n't ignore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one quite knows how to get there , " Shehnaz laughs . Shehnaz helps people connect with themselves and attain inner peace through the erudition of Sri Sri Ravi Shankar and the Art of Living Foundation . The program combines ancient wisdom with modern science to deal with afflictions of the mind , body and soul . It focuses on breathing techniques to help each person find their center and reconnect with themselves in a manner they never knew possible . It increases personal awareness and allows the body to release all its stress with the exhalation of each breath . According to Shehnaz , who became enamoured by the school of thought at a particularly dark juncture in her life , by day three of the two-week long course when rhythmic breathing is introduced , the person is already beginning to experience mental tranquility . <p> Shehnaz was first introduced to the Art of Living while finalizing an acrimonious divorce and dealing with depression caused by an empty nest syndrome . She admits that while it might sound ludicrous to many , something as simple as deep breathing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The breathing calms the nervous system and helps the brain deal with stressful situations better . While many may view this hypothesis with skepticism , there is no side effect to meditation and one can only benefit from it . The frenetic pace of life these days and the inability of many of us to disconnect from our hectic schedules leave little time for introspection or the chance to simply put up one 's feet and relax . At moments like these , the Art of Living and the meditative practices it teaches can aid a person in attaining stability and peace .

Meanwhile , over 250,000 people living alongside the Gaza border fled their homes in search of shelter deeper inside Israel , tourism took a dive and the indiscriminate killings of civilians in Gaza brought worldwide condemnation . Our readers will recall that this is not the first time Israel has resorted to unscrupulous military action against its neighbours . In mid-2006 , on the pretext of rescuing two soldiers allegedly abducted by Hezbollah , Israel launched a military offensive in Lebanon . Israel destroyed large parts of Beirut and damaged infrastructure in south Lebanon but the abducted soldiers were not found . The war ended without achieving declared objectives . Years later , the abducted soldiers were exchanged for Arab prisoners in Israeli detention in a deal brokered by the International Red Cross.The seven-week war cost over 2,000 lives , 72 percent of which were women and children , and pulverised over 10,000 buildings including homes , hospitals and mosques . People all over the world voiced outrage at the destruction and demanded immediate cessation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Israel and abroad condemned Israeli actions in Gaza . Early this week , 33 Holocaust survivors and 247 descendents of Holocaust survivors issued statements condemning Israeli actions and demanding an immediate halt to the carnage . In a strongly worded statement , they said , " As Jewish survivors and descendents of survivors of the Nazi genocide we unequivocally condemn the massacre of Palestinians in Gaza and the ongoing occupation and colonisation of historic Palestine . We further condemn the US for providing Israel with the funding to carry out the attack and western states more generally for using their diplomatic muscle to protect Israel from condemnation . Genocide begins with the silence of the world . We are alarmed by the extreme , racist dehumanisation of Palestinians in Israeli society that has reached a fever pitch . In Israel , politicians and pundits in The Times of Israel and The Jerusalem Post have called openly for the genocide of Palestinians and right wing Israelis are adopting neo Nazi insignia . Furthermore , we are disgusted and outraged by Elie Wiesel 's abuse of our history in these New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justify the unjustifiable : Israel 's wholesale effort to destroy Gaza and the murder of nearly 2,000 Palestinians including many hundreds of children . Nothing can justify bombing UN shelters , homes , hospitals and universities . Nothing can justify depriving people of electricity and water . We must raise our collective voices and use our collective power to bring about an end to all forms of racism , including the ongoing genocide of Palestinian people . We call for an immediate end to the siege against and blockade of Gaza . We call for the full economic , cultural and academic boycott of Israel . ' Never again ' must mean never again for anyone ! " Civilian casualties have shocked people across the world . The UN Human Rights Council appointed a commission led by William Schabas , a distinguished Canadian professor , to investigate how so many civilians were killed in the conflict . In reaction , an Israeli lobby issued a one-page long condemnation in The Washington Post demeaning William Schabas and saying the proposed commission would serve no useful purpose . If Israel 's government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting for a just cause why are they opposed to investigation by an international organisation ? Does the Israeli government feel it is within its right to periodically resort to mass slaughter in Gaza or in the West Bank in order to exterminate a race in Palestine ? Richard Cohen , in an article in The Washington Post on August 19 , lauded Israel for its legendary intelligence service that is capable of monitoring just about every phone conversation in Gaza . He was shown aerial photos that were so clear that license plates of parked cars could be compared with motor vehicle records . Israel knows who lives where , Cohen claimed , and these impressive technological feats suggest a kind of perfection . Cohen concluded , " If the bombing of a school or a hospital is not a mistake , then it must have been on purpose : Israel is the cold-hearted killer of children . " The Palestinian Authority has decided to approach the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) seeking indictments against those responsible for the murder of women and children in Gaza . Tel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mahmud Abbas that this would jeopardise the peace initiative . What a ridiculous proposition ! The ICC is an international judicial forum where many perpetrators have been tried and convicted of human rights abuses . The US ' attempts to restrain President Abbas from approaching the ICC are brazen partisanship since a US sponsored peace initiative collapsed long ago . John Kerry revived the peace talks with an artificial timeframe in mid-2013 . It achieved nothing because the US , being a party to the conflict , has lost the neutrality essential to broker peace . It remains the largest arms supplier to Israel and it unconditionally provides much needed diplomatic support for Israel to perpetuate the occupation of Palestinian lands . It is clear that a two state solution is no longer an option because the massive expansion of settlements has not left enough land for a viable Palestinian state . There could be one secular state , Israel , where all could live as equal citizens but hardliners led by Netanyahu will not agree because Israel would cease to be an exclusively Jewish state . In this polarised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scandinavians could come forward and jointly arbitrate in this long conflict but , prior to arbitration , both warring factions should accept the reality . Palestinians should accept Israel as an established fact . On the other hand , Israel should realise that , despite the possession of nuclear weapons , advanced military hardware and guarantees of unconditional support from the US , they are still searching for security . A nation can not survive for long by depending on another country . The key to Israel 's security lies in the hands of the homeless Palestinians living in Gaza and the West Bank . It would be wiser to enter a meaningful dialogue with the party that matters rather than looking for help from a friend thousands of miles away .

@@4647230 <p> In this nauseating and disingenuous confrontation of the elites , real issues are shoved into oblivion . Balochistan appears in the corporate media in accordance with the whims and needs of the deep state and ruling classes . Ever since the creation of Pakistan , Balochistan has been in a state of turmoil , revolts and insurgencies . Militant struggles and military operations rage on . In reality , Balochistan has become a festering wound on the body politic of the whole region , including Pakistan , Iran and Afghanistan . The discovery of mass graves in Tutak , more than 800 bodies of abducted activists dumped in Balochistan and Karachi , and the 18,000 missing persons , predominantly young people , are a stain on the system , state and the incumbent , so-called progressive government brought into power by Nawaz Sharif with the petitioning of over 600 NGOs . Under Abdul Malik Baloch 's watch the crisis has only been aggravated and its performance has proved to be even worse than the previous regime of clownish Aslam Raisani . Just as in Kashmir and Afghanistan , these killing fields have been outsourced to jihadis , resulting in making the lives of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell . In addition , proxy wars between various world and regional imperialist powers like the Iranian clergy and the Saudi monarchy are compounding miseries on a daily basis . It would be wrong to limit our analysis to proxy wars and communalisation of Baloch society . The Baloch youth in particular have a rich tradition of generations of revolutionary struggle against national and class oppression . The first stirrings of polarisation between the youth and the narrow nationalist leadership are beginning to emerge , particularly on the question of internationalism and class struggle . Imperialist corporate vultures from the US and China to Russia and India are looking for proxies mainly amongst the leaders and sections of the state to become partners in the imperialist plunder of Balochistan.Gwadar port , Mirani dam , the Makran coastal highway and other projects aimed at extracting the estimated $ 1.5 trillion in mineral wealth from Balochistan have intensified the great game between these imperialist monsters . The masses are being subjected to brutalities and excruciating social and economic woes . Baloch grievances in the past have centred on the gas fields ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribal territory ) that provide around a third of Pakistan 's energy . The Chinese corporation running the Saindak mine , in 2010 , processed around 15,000 tonnes of ore a day . Scientific estimates for the Reko Diq field near the borders of Afghanistan and Iran show up to 16 million tonnes of pure copper and 21 million ounces of gold that , if developed , would make Pakistan one of the world 's largest producers of copper ( though still far behind Chile ) and a serious gold producer.Ironically , Reko Diq could lead to explosive disputes between the Chinese contractors and among the tribes themselves , as has been the case with both Sui gas and Gwadar port . The principality that Baloch nationalists regard as the historic Baloch national state was that of Kalat , founded in 1638 around an oasis like that of Quetta , fed by two natural springs ( now dry because of tube-wells and the radical sinking of the water table ) . The British arrived in the region in the 1830s and from 1839 to 1847 fought a fierce war with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official , Sir Robert Sandeman , signed a treaty with the Khan bringing Kalat and its dependent territories under British suzerainty . During partition in 1947 , the myriad princely states of British India were voluntarily or involuntarily annexed to India or Pakistan , among them Kalat . While the new rulers of Pakistan claimed Kalat as a part of their new state , Baloch nationalists claimed that the relationship with the British Empire was closer to that of the British protectorate of Nepal that , after 1947 , became an independent state . The current insurgency is the fifth during the last seven decades between the Baloch masses and the state , the pro-establishment sardars , politicians , fundamentalist forces and those hungry for Balochistan 's resources . All these revolts have been concentrated in one tribal group or another , or parts of that group . In the late 1940s and 1950s , Mengals took the lead and , in the 1970s , it was the Marris . This allowed the Pakistani state to play on deep traditional rivalries between the tribes and , eventually , through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebel tribes , bring these revolts to an end . The Pakistani state 's approach is summed up in the remarkable fact that , as of 2009 , out of 65 members of the Baloch Provincial Assembly , 62 were in the provincial government as ministers or advisers with ministerial ranks . Every member of the government received Rs 50 million as a personal share of Balochistan 's development budget . This was an effective co-option of the tribal leadership , as it ensured all but three of the 80 odd tribal sardars or claimants in Balochistan were neutralised and arrayed with the government , as opposed to the armed struggle . Rather than the old British strategy , this was closer to the Roman approach of making smaller local tribal chieftains into local officials and bigger chiefs into Roman senators . By making them responsible for tax collection , these local leaders were also given a share in state revenues . The Romans , however , had the advantage of representing not just overwhelming military force and an efficient state bureaucracy but also a great state-building idea , summed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , Pakistani regimes have always been inefficient , corrupt and in economic decay.A senior army general summed up the state 's analysis and strategy to a British journalist in 2009 : " Everything here is shades of grey .

You always have to be prepared to negotiate with your enemies . Who knows , they may change sides and become your allies tomorrow . That is something the Americans still have not understood in Afghanistan ... That is why you can meet in Quetta many nationalist politicians who have declared themselves as rebels against Pakistan , but whom we deliberately have not touched . " Balochistan is plagued by extreme deprivation , poverty and joblessness . Social indicators are at rock bottom despite the province having the most natural resources .

@@4647235 <h> Why 2013 elections were rigged -- a statistical analysis <p> Were the 2013 elections rigged ? There is blood on the constitution avenue and thousands of people protesting against rigged elections . By some media reports there were at least 49 polling stations in the 2013 elections , registering a voter turnout of more than 100 per cent and some of the Election Commission of Pakistan ( ECP ) officials ( including an ex-additional secretary ) have come out supporting claims of vote rigging . Given this , it is time to look at the data from the ECP and put it to the test . What follows is to the best of my knowledge the first and most detailed comparison of election results of 2008 and 2013 . <p> When we compare data from the 2008 and 2013 elections we can see that there are clear signs of suspicious activity and rigging in the 2013 elections . Using data from the ECP and using measures like skewness , extra votes cast and confidence intervals we can not only see how many suspicious votes were cast , but also in which seats rigging may have taken place . There are several reasons why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they are consecutive elections . Secondly , the incumbents in 2008 lost , which is a sign that the elections were not rigged , whereas , in 2013 by and large incumbents won . For instance , PML-N won in Punjab , where it controlled the provincial government and PPP won in Sindh where it controlled the provincial government . Lastly , both the government of the time and opposition parties accepted the results of the 2008 elections , in contrast to the aftermath of the 2013 election . Given these reasons , using the 2008 elections as a base to make comparison with the 2013 elections seems natural . <p> A statistical analysis of 2008 and 2013 elections can give us significant information and more importantly , it can give us a road map of which seats to verify first -- if the ECP goes down that route . <p> A statistical analysis of 2008 and 2013 elections can give us significant information and more importantly , it can give us a road map of which seats to verify first -- if the ECP goes down that route @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can only know for sure which seats were rigged by physically verifying the ballots . However , this statistical analysis can become an important map for future verification processes and it can become an important tool to press for such verifications . <p> Let 's start with some basic comparison between the 2008 and 2013 elections . In 2013 there were about 46.6 million votes cast , compared to 34.8 million votes in 2008 . This means that in 2013 there were about 11.8 million extra votes cast ( figure 1 ) . The percentage of votes polled to registered voters increased by 9.8 percentage points to 54.0 per cent in the 2013 elections . <p> Figure 1 <p> *Source of data : Election Commission of Pakistan <p> Probably the most significant sign of rigging will show up in the increased skewness of vote distribution . In a non-rigged election we would expect some seats to have low voter turnout and some seats to have high voter turnout , with most seats falling in the middle . This type of distribution is called a normal distribution . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see a proportionally higher number of seats with high voter turnout ( because of bogus votes and ballot stuffing ) , skewing the distribution to the right . Moreover , the magnitude of skewness will be proportional to the rigging undertaken . Figure 2 shows the distribution of 2008 and 2013 election votes by National Assembly ( NA ) seats . The 2008 elections look fairly normally distributed , which as discussed before , is a sign that the 2008 elections were relatively rigging free . However , the 2013 election results are significantly skewed to the right . Furthermore , Kurtosis ( a statistical measure of skewness ) for a 2013 was 4.5 compared to 2.6 in 2008 , which is a significant increase in skewness . This puts a question mark on the whole increase of 11.8 million votes in 2013 . This skewness of vote distribution is a clear sign of vote rigging in 2013 . Based on this measure alone , the people of Pakistan can and should demand impartial vote verification . <p> Figure 2 <p> *Source of data : Election Commission of Pakistan <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the increase in votes cast in each seat were outside the norm . If a seat witnessed unusually high voter turnout in 2013 compared to 2008 , then this may be an indication of vote rigging . To look at unusually high voter turnout ( votes polled as a percentage of registered voters ) , we can look at seats where the increase in voter turnout in 2013 was outside the 90 per cent confidence interval . A confidence interval is a range of values that describes the uncertainty surrounding an estimate . The " 90 per cent " in the confidence interval represents a level of certainty about our estimate . So very loosely speaking and in lay man 's terms , confidence intervals are a statistical tool to look at the likelihood of an event . If an event is likely it will be within the confidence interval , whereas unusually or unlikely events will be outside of the confidence interval . Being outside confidence in itself is probably not a sign of rigging . However , being outside of confidence interval and the increased skewness of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on 90 per cent confidence interval measure , there are about 76 NA seats , in the 2013 elections , where voter turnout increase was outside the confidence interval . This means that there is a significantly high chance of vote rigging in these NA seats . As this is based on probability , so not all of these 76 seats may be rigged , and indeed there may be many rigged seats that have not been captured in this 90 per cent confidence interval . Having said that , these 76 NA seats are an indication of potential vote rigging in the 2013 elections and may be just the tip of the iceberg . <p> Rigging involves support of the ECP officials , police and state machinery . Given this , incumbents have greater means to rig election . Using this logic , we can look at incumbents who have won seats where voter turnout was unusually high , i.e. , outside the 90 per cent confidence interval . Based on this , there are 31 seats with strong potential signs of vote rigging . Table 1 lists these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unusually high voter turnout compared to 2008 , this table can be used as a starting point for vote verification . <p> Table 1 <p> Some people can argue that maybe the increased votes were based on a higher proportion of young voters , and/or the entrance of a politician who inspired higher voter turnout , i.e. , Imran Khan effect . It is important to address these concerns . Let 's look at the Imran Khan effect first . If we look at the seats where Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) won , voter participation increased by 9.02 percentage points between 2008 and 2013 , far less than the difference of 15.66 percentage points used in the 90 per cent confidence interval employed above . <p> Now let 's look at the youth effect . If the increase in voter turnout in 2013 was due to higher youth participation then we would expect to see this effect in all constituencies and not just some . However , looking in Figure 1 , we can see that votes do not rise proportionally in all constituencies . In fact , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the right . So we can rule out the theory that this unusually high voter turnout in some NA seats for the 2013 elections is based on higher youth participation . Lastly , the standard deviation of the confidence intervals used above is based on increased votes between 2008 and 2013 . Given this , the confidence intervals used already take variables like youth and/or entrance of a dynamic politician into account . More simply put , even after taking these concerns into account , there are clear signs of potential vote rigging in the 2013 elections . <p> Rigging involves support of the ECP officials , police and state machinery . Given this , incumbents have greater means to rig election . Using this logic , we can look at incumbents who have won seats where voter turnout was unusually high . <p> Moreover , it is interesting to see who won the above seats and where are they located . Most of these seats were won by either Pakistan People 's Party Parliamentarians ( PPPP ) or Pakistan Muslim League - Nawaz ( PML-N ) ( figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we see these parties as being the biggest obstacle to vote verification . Moreover , most of these seats were either located in interior Sindh or Punjab -- bastions of PPPP and PML-N . <p> Figure 3 . <p> *Where suspicious seats are as based on Table 1 . <p> If true , then these 76 NA seats , or even the more conservative estimate of 31 NA seats ( using the incumbent measure ) , are a clear indication of voter fraud . Moreover , these numbers are far higher than the four seats where PTI wants ballot verification . <p> Given the measure of skewness and the unusually high number of votes cast in some seats , the ECP should use table 1 as a starting point for vote verification . Votes cast by the people are probably the most important tool and right of democracy . Moreover , democracy is a process of choosing your government , but if someone overrules the choice of the people by vote rigging , then can it still be called a democracy ? The answer for me is a resounding no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ECP to make sure that no one steals this valuable right and that a proper , impartial and systematic vote verification is launched to look at the anomalies of 2013 elections . <h> 11 Comments <p> You have taken 2008 election as a benchmark however it would have made more sense if you have also compared it with 1997 elections . 2008 elections can not be used as a benchmark for various reasons .

@@4649235 <p> I have always wondered what the English phrase " delusions of grandeur " meant . But if Imran Khan and his supporters can be credited with one thing it is that they have demonstrated this phrase to all of Pakistan . It seems that Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf ( PTI ) supporters are suffering from such incredible delusions of grandeur that they are ready to appropriate any form of resistance to the government or political class as of their own making . Sadly , they do not even bother to find out the circumstances before pronouncing their victories and making their tall claims.Take , for example , the recent episode with respect to Maryam Nawaz . Social media was abuzz with the claim that the incident in which Maryam Nawaz 's request to have a maid upgraded to business class on a PIA flight to London was somehow or the other another challenge to Pakistan 's VIP culture . And news channels that have unfortunately become vehicles of the anti-political propaganda of the military establishment immediately jumped onto the bandwagon with respect to making similar claims . However , if any objective analysis of the event were made it would be abundantly clear that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not the opposite.It was not the case that Maryam Nawaz was unwilling to pay for the upgraded seat . Those who travel frequently would already know such an upgrade is quite common in international flights where there are empty seats in business class . These upgrades are made on the basis of frequent flyer miles that are linked to credit cards . However , mainstream media has completely ignored the central fact that this was a request for an upgrade that was granted at first and then reversed when it was discovered that the person being upgraded belonged to the working class . Instead , the media has tried to paint the distorted view that Maryam Nawaz wished for her maid to sit on a seat that she had not paid for.The sad reality is that in our class-conscious culture we are not ready to share our space with working people . And if a working class person comes and sits in what we euphemistically call " business class " , our upper classes are greatly angered by the mixing of the classes . These are supposed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is the bourgeois class . How can a working person be found sitting in business class ? And so , apparently , a senior bureaucrat , who refused to sit with a working class person in what is no doubt a class-divided plane reflective of a class-divided society , complained to the captain . The captain in turn gave solid proof of his ' good upbringing ' by refusing to have a maid in the exclusive space of the bourgeoisie , which is business class . Hence , if anything , this entire incident shows that VIP culture , the class-conscious culture , is ingrained deeply in our society.The irony though is not merely the fact of the existence of this VIP , class-conscious culture but the fact that the media and those who are claiming to be representatives of a new Pakistan did not see how deeply this entire incident reflects the old Pakistan that needs to be changed . Quite the contrary , the fact that they viewed this entire incident as a victory of new Pakistan is itself indicative of the conservative upper-class character of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to defend in any way , shape or form the Sharif family . However , the issue of contention here is not really the Sharif family at all . The real issue is our refusal to share our space with working people .

@@4649236 <h> Media polarisation creates confusion in society <p> Unprecedentedly high media polarisation in Pakistan has created confusion in society besides doubts about the media 's credibility , especially the electronic media . The level of this polarity is strong enough to evoke extreme media positions on the ongoing political stalemate in a vivid manner . Due to these consistent media positions , even general media consumers are in a position to identify the television news channels that are supporting the PTI-PAT sit-ins and those that are not.Those who want to see the real , bias-free and neutral picture of the prevalent political scenario are really baffled regarding which channel to watch to get an impartial and professional point of view . Surely it is difficult to see many news channels with extreme points of view and slant on the same issue and then arrive at an opinion while avoiding the impact of media framing.Sensing the obvious bias of some media houses , many active consumers of television news channels started to crosscheck the information on other media channels .

However , in the electronic media the craze of high ratings and the competition to break the news first of all has damaged professional standards . Some news anchors and news channels seem ready to go to any extreme to get better ratings . Hence coming back to newspaper reports , editorials and columns seems very natural and realistic.Furthermore , the allegations regarding the glittering of money in the electronic media industry , the claim of bribe of Rs 200 million and even more and the alleged support from the secret hands are some other stigma on the face of the powerful fourth estate .

According to Development Media Theory , which is applied in the countries having lower economic development and limited resources like is the case in Pakistan , media freedom should be subordinated to provide required support for social , economic and political development . Unfortunately our media houses ' policies mostly focus on their political and economic interests instead of the national political-economic stakes.The media polarisation started during the regime of Asif Ali Zardari , who in his endeavour to tackle the negative coverage of his government by one particular media group , not only boycotted the group but also supported two other media groups in order to balance his portrayal in the country . Thus three visible media poles were created in Pakistan during his era , including a pro-Zardari regime , anti-Zardari regime and the neutral groups.The media industry 's growth in the form of private media houses since 2002 was being taken as a very positive indicator for converting Pakistan to an information-rich society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . No doubt media proved itself as a great blessing for the country in the recent past and brought the nation out of many untoward circumstances.However , unfortunately certain forces in the country seem to be bent upon achieving some gains by targeting and bribing media persons in their individual and organisational capacity . Now it is high time to come to grips with these allegations . Now let us turn towards the true role of media . The required social role of the media is a responsible role to save and strengthen the nation . Surely there is a solution to every problem and the media , instead of becoming part of the problem and flaring up the issue on daily basis through partisanship , must become part of the solution . Only a professional media with a national commitment and the sense of social responsibility as the fourth estate can help bring the nation out of this national political standoff.

In a time before man even considered enacting onstage in front of an audience , string puppetry has delighted audiences . It has been said to have originated in as early as 2000 BC Egypt , practised in Ancient Greece where it was also known as marionettes and became a rage in Rajashtan in India , where it was known as the kathputli . And so , with the promise to take us back centuries , Thespianz Theatre , in collaboration with the PACC , hosted a puppet theatre that brought to an eager audience beloved folk tales from Sindh and Punjab . <p> However , despite the many selling points of the collaboration , with the added feature of targeting children , a demographic rampantly ignored in most cultural collaborations , the event could almost have been labelled a disaster . <p> Thankfully , the storytelling salvaged the night and of course the commendable performances by the puppeteers .

This was an unexpected intrusion , considering that many of PACC 's events are smooth sailing , without cameras being shoved into one 's face . <p> Moving on to the show itself , string puppetry , with its colourful backdrops and vibrant costumes , is the perfect medium to narrate folk tales . The folk tale Umar Marvi , among the various tragic romances from Sindh , set the tone of the show by narrating the story of Marvi , whose beauty has become a legend in her surrounding villages .

The Karbala shrines were reconstructed later as the Saudi proxies were beaten back but they would not allow the rebuilding of the ones at Madinah , which remains firmly under their heel . As the mufti rumbled on , the Saudi government appointed minders at the Baqee cemetery continued very vocal takfir ( apostatising ) of the visitors in Urdu , Pashto , Persian and , of course , Arabic .

Saudi anxiety is palpable but it is not out of compassion for the victims of ISIS 's grotesquely brutal war . Over 2,000 Saudi nationals have reportedly been fighting alongside ISIS and the Riyadh regime is worried about the twin threat that some of them or their fellow travellers within the kingdom and ISIS knocking at its northwestern borders might pose . This would not be the first time the house of Saud feels the heat from the jihadist fires it has been stoking as far out as Afghanistan and Pakistan . The Saudi Ikhwan , sired by Emir Ibne Saud , before he re-established the Wahhabi kingdom , had rebelled against the regime in the early 20th century .

Both the Juhayman 's Ikhwan -- they remain active in Saudi Arabia and as the JuD -- the ISIS impugn the legitimacy of the Saudi regime on doctrinal grounds for not being Salafi enough and also consider it politically wayward . Little surprise then that ISIS teaches in its core curriculum the letters of Juhayman and writings of Ibne Wahhab al Najdi .

@@4651238 <h> Confessions of a Pakistan fan-turned-cynic <p> I did this last in 2008 , and it is not something I am proud of . In a time where we have an overload of constant information and infinite perspectives , there is a tendency amongst us to cling to what we know , to what we are comfortable with . Perhaps no contemporary emotion is as pervasive , at least to me , as cynicism -- a retreat into pulling everything down . Cynicism and despair come across as the fear of those who wish to pretend they are able to understand what they ca n't . Hope , sincerity , love -- those are brave emotions to aim for , because they are instinctively mistrusted , and believed to be na ? ve and foolish . So back to 2008 , when while watching Pakistan succumb to what would be their heaviest defeat to India in all one-day matches until then , I wrote : " I 'm too young to be an old fogey living in the past ... but the future feels uninhabitable at this rate . " My first reaction when I revisited this post yesterday was to laugh . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , particularly the 2009 World T20 win , were right around the corner . And yet , I also laughed because I was eerily prescient . Six years later , Pakistan cricket has unarguably gone through its worst period ever . I do n't wish to recount the list of the disasters of this era -- you know it by now . <p> In 2008 , a part of me had started to admit what I had feared since 2003 , which was When Wasim and Waqar left . It had started to dawn on me that Pakistan 's " temporary " slide since then was actually something more permanent . That instead of resuming our role as the world 's most unpredictable and watchable side once we got over the shock of losing those greats , we were actually going to become a downright mediocre one . It says a lot about the state of my delusion , but also perhaps of the assorted heroics and triumphs since , that this slow admission has still not transformed itself into belief . But now things are getting quite terrible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losing their dominance over India , but now that question is largely irrelevant . In 2014 , Pakistan are barely pulling together enough to make ends meet , on or off the pitch . Take a look at how deplorable our record is in the one skill that all of modern cricket venerates -- batting . Like a leggie who keeps bowling googlies , Pakistani batting 's current variation is the solid outing , while its stock delivery is the collapse . <p> In 2008 , Pakistan had their world-class bowlers , and they continued inventing new ways of losing a once-in-a-generation bowler forever . But none of those ignominious ends compare to the utter , devastating tragedy of Saeed Ajmal 's ban . As I write this , I keep feeling that we Pakistani fans are like the relatives of a witch burnt at the stake -- forced to watch the destruction of a loved one who has been condemned as a heretic .

I vowed to never be cynical like them , yet I increasingly find myself turning to trashing my own players just to feel satisfied for a few seconds . And while all fans are tribal and divisive , the state of listening to Pakistani fans bicker wildly in the midst of terrible results is simply atrocious . I am not above the fray here , but every now and then I catch myself being this repulsive and wonder how my younger self would see me now . <p> In 2008 , my post had a little aside where I praised Misbah 's infamous 2007 final scoop as " a romantic encapsulation of the Pakistani spirit " . Yet now , the most tiresome and intractable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit , or kept it alive . None of us manages to avoid this debate , and no one has any definitive answers . A while back I had tried to cheer myself up by arguing that the debate showed just how important playing a certain way was to Pakistan . Yet even that respite has lost its charm , as Misbah 's typically frustrating loss of form right at the start of the run-up to the World Cup has made this debate urgent once more . The sectarian divisions I just mentioned have now become nauseatingly pervasive , and we all keep adding to them without finding any way to stop . <p> Just like 2008 , today I hate to sound this despondent and hopeless , simply because apart from everything else , Pakistan cricket routinely sets you up for a surprise .

@@4653238 <p> In a speech and a subsequent tweet recently , Imran Khan produced this alleged quote from Macaulay : " I have travelled across the length and breadth of India and I have not seen one person who is a beggar , who is a thief . Such wealth I have seen in this country , such high moral values , people of such calibre , that I do not think that we would ever conquer this country , unless we break the very backbone of this nation , which is her cultural and spiritual heritage , and , therefore , I propose that we replace her old and ancient education system , her culture , for if the Indians think that all that is foreign and English is good and greater than their own , they will lose their self-esteem , their native culture and they will become what we want them -- a truly dominated nation . " This is a bogus quote ( though clearly Imran Khan would hardly know better ) , invented by Hindutvadis in India during the 1998-2002 Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) government . Hindutvadis had just begun moulding history in India -- just as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pakistan -- to show that the native culture had been destroyed by those evil colonialists . The basic premise of this cultural relativist argument is that India was doing just fine before the British came and that the colonial project destroyed , very deliberately , the " high moral values " and the " cultural and spiritual heritage " of the natives . The real Macaulay 's Minute of course is part of historical record and it contains no such thing . The original minute can be found online at the Columbia University website and can be verified.Now the colonial project was a mercantile project ; there are no qualms with that proposition . The British colonialists did whatever they did out of own self-interest and no particular love for the natives . Still , let us not assume that everything was hunky dory before the British came and that the British did not bestow anything worthwhile on South Asia . The fact of the matter is that before the British came to the subcontinent , the idea of a state and society did not exist . There were no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the late 18th century and certainly nothing of the kind that existed in the UK or the west . India -- not even really one country by any stretch of the imagination -- was in a state of total and complete decay . What we had in the subcontinent were rajas , maharajas and Mughal emperors as feudal overlords who gave very little in return for nominal obedience . There was no law except the law of the stick and carrot , devoid entirely of any sense of justice . When the English were building courtrooms , hospitals , mental asylums , schools and universities , rulers in the subcontinent of India were busy building mausoleums , gardens and pleasure houses . Even the few contributions that were made to science by Muslim rulers elsewhere were made a long time ago . Ulugh Beg 's Observatory was made in the 15th century . Nizamul Mulk 's schools dated back to the Seljuk era . The Mughal emperors , unfortunately , were only interested in perpetuating their despotic rule . The two exceptions , somewhat , were Akbar and Aurangzeb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his rebellion against the conservative Sunni religious milieu . Aurangzeb imparted a few projects of public welfare out of puritan religious guilt . By and large though , by the end of the 18th century , the literacy rates of Muslims and Hindus were woefully low and they lived utterly medieval lives under feudal fiefdoms and overlords who ruled by fiat and arbitrary whims . The British Raj , right from the beginning of Clive 's Company Raj in Bengal , which was one of the worst forms of commercial exploitation , was far better in its approach than anything that had existed previously . By the time Lord Macaulay joined the Governor General 's Council as a law member and gave his famous ' Minute on Education ' , the British Raj was already well advanced . His contempt for the natives was considerable but so was his belief that English education and English civilisation could help raise the standards of the natives to equal that of the Europeans . Contrary to Imran Khan 's bogus quote , Macaulay arrogantly declared : " I have no knowledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could to form a correct estimate of their value . I have read translations of the most celebrated Arabic and Sanskrit works . I have conversed , both here and at home , with men distinguished by their proficiency in the Eastern tongues . I am quite ready to take the oriental learning at the valuation of the orientalists themselves . I have never found one among them who could deny that a single shelf of a good European library was worth the whole native literature of India and Arabia . The intrinsic superiority of western literature is indeed fully admitted by those members of the committee who support the oriental plan of education . " This too is as much an exaggeration as what Imran Khan purports to be Macaulay 's words . Arab and Sanskrit literature was extremely rich , ancient and the knowledge transmitted through these two languages was in no small part responsible for what the west was . After all , it is the west that celebrates Rhazes and Rushd . These were men of the east . Yet it was not entirely incorrect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hindus alike was so abysmal that Macaulay was driven to say this . Macaulay 's contribution in terms of introducing modern English education can not be underplayed .

In Pakistan 's case , there was no finer specimen of Macaulay 's dream than Jinnah himself , a Macaulayite in temperament , habit , mannerism and ideas . So , while we criticise Macaulay for his almost racial contempt and ignorance of Arabic and Sanskrit literature , we should also credit him for creating that class of individuals who were later to lead the subcontinent to its independence . <p> The writer is a lawyer based in Lahore and the author of the book Mr Jinnah : Myth and Reality .

@@4655235 <p> A fairly common demand of conservative Muslim political parties is that the death penalty be implemented as punishment for blasphemy in accordance with sharia or Islamic law . It is therefore worth looking at the textual sources that are used to justify this law . Interestingly , investigation reveals that there is no Quranic basis for any blasphemy law at all . Further investigation reveals that the blasphemy law arises from the secondary legal source of sunnah ( or prophetic practice ) . However , the prophetic practice as described in the sirah ( prophetic biographies ) does not establish any death penalty for blasphemy . The sirah passages that might have provided a basis for the blasphemy law actually seem to be dealing with secular nationalist issues , namely treason during wartime . Finally , the relevant hadith ( prophetic sayings ) that advocate the blasphemy law may be the product of political tampering by the early caliphate during the post-prophetic wars of apostasy ( rida ) . Even if the relevant hadith is reliable , justification of any blasphemy law in sharia through these religious sources may still be questioned.To begin with , we can look at the Quranic position on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious offence against God but no earthly legal penalty is ever mentioned . Rather , the Quran emphasises that God will ultimately punish blasphemers , not any human law . " Those who disbelieve and oppose the messenger after the guidance hath been manifested unto them , they hurt God not a jot , and He will make their actions fruitless . Those who disbelieve and turn from the way of God and then die disbelievers , God surely will not pardon them " ( Qur'an 47:32 , 34 ) . This verse makes the point that God can not be harmed even " a jot " , the logical implication of which is that the blasphemy laws are not required for His protection . This is in keeping with the following verses that explicitly identify punishment for blasphemy and disbelief as being in the afterlife , with no mention of any earthly punishment . " ? God hath promised those who believe and do good works : theirs will be forgiveness and immense reward . And they who disbelieve and deny Our revelation , such are the rightful owners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Quran even tells the Prophet ( PBUH ) directly that it is foolish to expect everyone to follow him , as only God knows who will find guidance and humans , including messengers of God , have no ability to control this . " They indeed are losers who deny their meeting with God until , when the hour cometh on them suddenly , they cry . Alas for us , that we neglected it ! ... We know how well their talk grieveth thee , though in truth they deny not thee , but the evil-doers flout the revelations of Allah . Messengers indeed have been denied before thee , and they were patient under the denial and the persecution till Our succour reached them . There is none to alter the decisions of God ... And if their aversion is grievous unto thee , then , if thou canst , seek a way down into the earth or a ladder unto the sky that thou mayst bring unto them a portent ... If God willed , He could have brought them all together to the guidance -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Qur'an 6:31-35 ) . How can traditional Islamic law justify punishing blasphemy with death , given the lack of any mention of earthly punishment at all for this crime in the Quran ? The answer is that traditional Islamic law is not derived only from the Quran but also from the sunnah , as is established by the hadith . A narrative of prophetic actions , and hence of sunnah , can also be derived from the sirah . So , these additional sources have to be considered . When we look at the prophetic practice as recounted in the sirah biographies , we do find a precedent that may initially seem to support the death penalty for blasphemy . This is the killing of Ka'b ibn al Ashraf , a Medinan who composed poetry opposing the Muslims . After the battle of Badr , Ka'b recited verses praising the Meccan Qureish whom the Muslims had slain and mocking the Muslim victors . He was slain by Muslims acting according to the Prophet 's ( PBUH ) instructions : " The apostle said ... ' Who will rid me of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I will deal with him for you , O apostle of God , I will kill him . ' He said , ' Do so if you can ' " ( The Life of Muhammad : A Translation of Ibn Ishaq 's Sirat Rasul Allah , page 367 , by Alfred Guillaume ) . On the face of it , this seemingly justifies the death penalty for speaking against the Prophet ( PBUH ) . However , blasphemy implies a religious offence . A significant fact about Ka'b ibn al Ashraf is that his opposition to Muhammad was not religious in nature . Rather , he was a political opponent of the Muslim community of Medina . In spite of being a Medinan , and nominally at peace with the Muslims living there , Ka'b publicly allied himself with the Qureish , who had not only expelled the Muslims from Mecca but were still in a state of war with them . So , technically , this killing was not for blasphemy at all , but treason during wartime.A second incident that throws light on the secular nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Medinan tribe of Banu Qurayzah . The Banu Qurayzah were punished after the " battle of the ditch " , when the Muslims of Medina protected themselves from the attacking Meccans by digging a protective trench around the city . During the battle , the Banu Qurayzah allied themselves with the Qureish . As a result , after the Meccans had been repelled , the Muslims besieged the Banu Qurayzah . The Banu Qurayzah surrendered on the condition that their fate be decided by a Muslim , Saad ibn Muadh , from whom they expected leniency . However , Saad gave the decision that all the men of Banu Qurayzah should be killed , their property seized and their women and children enslaved . The execution of the men of Banu Qurayzah was obviously for treason , not blasphemy , as unlike Ka'b they did not speak publicly against the Muslims.The fact that the death penalty was used against both Banu Qurayzah and Ka'b ibn al Ashraf in similar circumstances points to the fact that their crime was the same . It is a fair generalisation that most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocating the death penalty for treason , especially during war ; the Medinan state of the Prophet ( PBUH ) was no exception . Thus , these two cases taken together do not provide any basis for establishing the death penalty as a punishment for blasphemy.So far , it seems that there is support for the death penalty as punishment for blasphemy neither in the Quran , nor in the sunnah as mentioned in the prophetic biographies . The only remaining possible source for the blasphemy law is the hadith . In fact , there are hadith reports supporting the death penalty for blasphemy , such as the following attributed to Ibn Abbas , one of the companions of the Prophet ( PBUH ) : " Whoever changes his Islamic religion , kill him " ( Sahih al-Bukhari ) . Here we see that the position of the hadith is remarkably different from the Quran , in that this hadith report does explicitly advocate the death penalty for apostasy . It should be noted that apostasy is not exactly the same as blasphemy , as blasphemy usually implies publicly insulting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purely private renunciation of religion , in which case it would not be blasphemy . However , a Muslim committing blasphemy in public may be legally judged to have become an apostate , and so the two offenses become related . Thus , hadith reports such as the above become the legal justification for the death penalty for both apostasy and blasphemy in traditional Islamic law . <p> ( To be continued ) <p> The writer holds a Master of Theological Studies degree from Harvard Divinity School in the US .

In the following days , countrywide protests were held against any change in Noreen 's conviction and in this connection two prominent politicians were murdered for supporting her . During the court hearings and public debates , only Pakistan 's blasphemy laws were heatedly discussed but not the caste prejudices . <p> After four long years , Noreen 's appeal against death sentence was heard by the Lahore High Court on Oct16 . Her lawyer , Naeem Shakir , argued in the appeal that the crux of the matter was untouchability rather than a clash between Christian and Islamic faiths . Referring to the trial court judgment , he argued that the judge wrongly believed the conflict was purely of religious nature . <p> The trial court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Islam permits Muslims eating and drinking with the " People of the Book " , e.g. , Christians , Jews and Sabians . The Holy Qur'an emphatically declares that " The food of the People of the Book is lawful unto you and yours is lawful unto them " ( 5:5 ) . <p> The trial court did not discuss the role of untouchability in the case . Islam permits Muslims eating and drinking with the " People of the Book " , e.g. , Christians , Jews and Sabians . The Holy Qur'an emphatically declares that " The food of the People of the Book is lawful unto you and yours is lawful unto them " ( 5:5 ) <p> There is a possibility that Noreen got provoked and sarcastically retorted after being humiliated over her courteous act , but the question arises : From where did her co-workers get the notion of ritual impurity in the first place ? <p> The concept of untouchability as means of keeping certain people at distance emerged with the arrival of Aryans in India about 4000 years ago . The word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " colour " . The light-skinned Aryans declared the dark-skinned aboriginal people untouchable through these laws to keep them out of social , political and economic spheres . <p> Christians in Punjab are sometimes treated as untouchable because many of them trace their origin to these aboriginal inhabitants of the land . During the colonial period they converted to Christianity to escape this social stigma . These Christian converts were still treated as untouchable by high caste Hindus . Renowned scholar Aysha Jalal in her book Self and Sovereignty suggests that Christians sided with the Muslims in the independence movement in Punjab because they thought they would be treated with dignity in Pakistan as both were monotheists . Noreen 's case shows that the treatment of Christians as untouchable continues unabated ; now at the hands of Muslims , instead of Hindus . <p> The Indian Muslims learned caste disabilities through close proximity with Hindus over almost a millennium . The light skinned Muslims of Arab , Turk , Persian and Afghan descent called themselves ashraf ( noble-born ) and they called local converts to Islam ajlaf ( lowly-born ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put them in low occupations , and did not marry with them as dictated by the Hindu caste system but was against the egalitarian nature of Islam . It is in this context that Sir Syed Ahmed Khan 's Aligarh University admitted only high caste Muslims while banned admission to low caste Muslims . The Aligarh movement gave birth to All India Muslim League that struggled for a separate homeland for Muslims of India . <p> It would be no wonder if Pakistan 's name owes to the caste dichotomy of pure ( Persian pak ) and impure ( Persian paleed ) . In order to ridicule the Muslim League independence movement , Maulana Abul Ala Maududi called Pakistan ( land of the pure ) as Paleedistan ( land of the impure ) . <p> The founding father Muhammad Ali Jinnah was well aware of the deeply ingrained caste biases in Indian Muslim minds . In his inaugural speech before the constituent assembly on August 11 , 1947 , Mr Jinnah clearly identified casteism , racism and religious discrimination as causes of hindrance to progress : <p> " If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone of you , no matter to what community he belongs , no matter what relations he had with you in the past , no matter what is his colour , caste or creed , is first , second and last a citizen of this state with equal rights , privileges , and obligations , there will be no end to the progress you will make " . <p> Mr Jinnah 's words , however , slowly vanished from the political landscape of the country . The 1956 Constitution of Pakistan and 1974 Constitution of Azad Jammu and Kashmir state : <p> " Untouchability is abolished and its practice in any form forbidden and shall be declared by law to be an offence " . <p> Christians in Punjab are sometimes treated as untouchable because many of them trace their origin to these aboriginal inhabitants of the land . During the colonial period they converted to Christianity to escape this social stigma <p> No such law was ever enacted to penalise the practice of untouchability . The 1962 Constitution of Pakistan watered down the real intent of Mr Jinnah by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No law should permit or in any way to facilitate the introduction into Pakistan of the practice of untouchability in any form " . <p> Secession of East Pakistan in 1971 had the skin colour based dichotomy , a basic feature of casteism . Stanley Wolpert suggests that Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Yahya Khan could not hand over the country to the Bengalis " whose small , dark-skinned physiques neither of them believed worthy specimens of Pakistani stature " . The Islamisation agenda after the fall of Dhaka totally silenced the new constitution on untouchability . Since then the topic is totally withdrawn from public debate . <p> Answering a question raised by Denmark over the treatment of outcaste Hindus in the Universal Periodic Review of the United Nations Human Rights Council in 2008 , Pakistan stated : <p> " It is a Muslim country and does not have the concept of Dalit ... it is free from such kind of prejudices , and the existing norms do not contain discrimination on the basis of caste or creed " . <p> Intrusion of religion in every sphere of life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the subject have given way to confusing untouchability with Islamic purification rites . <p> Islamic jurisprudence requires removal of physical contamination , which is of temporary nature and is to be washed away before the observance of religious rites . <p> Unlike Islam , Hinduism believes ritual impurity is innate , nonphysical and permanent . One can only improve on the scale of purity by being born in a higher caste in the next incarnation . It is possible if one 's good karma of his previous life outweighs the bad karma . <p> Hindu religious philosophy has lost relevance in Pakistan as more than 95 per cent of the population consists of Muslims , but untouchability as a social norm is very much alive . Ordinary Muslims have uniquely put untouchability into the mould of Islamic concepts of purification . Some believe that conversion to Islam can remove inborn impurity of untouchables as Noreen 's co-workers suggested her . <p> The Pakistani state is responsible for this mess because it ignored Mr Jinnah 's instructions . Though the concept of untouchability is pivotal to Hindu religious philosophy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preaching and practicing it through the 1955 Protection of Civil Rights Act . Millions of low caste Hindus and Christians would have been saved from being treated as untouchable if Pakistan had enacted a law against untouchability . Also , this way Pakistan would not have been put to shame on international forums and media , two of our politicians would not have been murdered and the conflict between Noreen and her co-workers would not have turned into a religious one in the first place . <p> It was the case systme for all he criticisms that save India and Hindu culture from being overwhelmed by the invaders even after one millennium of rule.they could not break throgh the caste barrier and so the few who did convert adopted this same approach for being reverted to their original castes.islam does practice colour bar.An arab muslim the original muslim , th rest are converts and that ; s how they are treated much as we would like to pretend it is other wise ! @ @ @

While selling their products , companies forget the ethical dilemmas associated with unauthentic packaging and make their products look tempting and catchy . <p> They overstate facts , for example , 100% pure orange juice , 85% less fat butter , sugar-free cake , etc .

" Marketing firms just play this game . They make buyers think about their product the way they want , not how it actually is ! <p> The quantity and quality of the actual product is concealed behind the immense creativity of the packaging . A packet of chips has 60% to 70% of air in it . It seems like you are paying the price for purchasing air rather than chips . <p> A cake packaged in a brown paper would certainly be more unpleasant than a cake packaged in a fancy box with sprinkled glitter . We do n't even consider the fact that " looks are often deceptive " and the taste and quality of the former might be better . <p> Of course , the impressive packaging is more prone to become the quintessential sign of quality in our minds . But then again the packaging companies are not the only ones to blame ; we are equally delusional based upon the looks . <p> Colours and characters <p> The use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is another technique used by marketers these days .

This is how these manipulations and the attractions towards junk conclude . <p> Candies , chocolates , chips , etc are the unhealthy items which are mostly marketed to children .

I have seen many children forcing their parents to buy items which they do n't even know about like tooth pastes , tissue boxes , shampoos , etc . They just demand that product because of their favourite characters or colours on them . <p> Healthy intake of food should be given significance for numerous reasons ; one reason is the drastically increased apprehension about obesity in Pakistan . <p> Among many other reasons , attractive packaging has also played vitally in enhancing obesity .

@@4659236 days ago , a video of erstwhile pop icon and widely heard Islamic evangelist , Junaid Jamshed went viral on the Internet , in which his remarks were perceived as blasphemy against the Prophet Muhammad ( PBUH ) and his wife , Ayesha ( RA ) . <p> By the time of the writing of this article , he has been charged under the Blasphemy Law ( clause 295-C of the Pakistan Penal Code ) . The clause reads : <p> 295-C -- Use of derogatory remarks , etc. , in respect of the Holy Prophet : <p> Whoever by words , either spoken or written , or by visible representation or by any imputation , innuendo , or insinuation , directly or indirectly , defiles the sacred name of the Holy Prophet Muhammad ( peace be upon him ) shall be punished with death , or imprisonment for life , and shall also be liable to fine . <p> The law prescribes a fixed death penalty for all those who are found guilty . The option of life imprisonment was made defunct after a 1991 Federal Shariat Court judgement . <p> Junaid Jamshed has already responded with a public repentance , re-affirmation of his faith and a plea for pardon . <p> Unfortunately , for Junaid Jamshed , the dominant religious narrative in the country holds that blasphemy is an unpardonable offence . <p> Simply put -- you blaspheme , you die . <p> No ifs , ands or buts about it . The credibility of this assertion is built on an apparently universal consensus ( ijma ) on the subject across all four Sunni schools of thought . By maintaining this front of scholarly consensus , the religious leadership disallows any concept of an alternative position . <p> This idea of a unanimous scholarly endorsement of an unwaivable death penalty for blasphemy has been relentlessly repeated : in the Federal Sharia Court Judgment on the blasphemy law in the ' 90s , in the Parliament , in the popular print and oral narrative on television channels , and has seeped deeply into the consciousness of the Pakistani population . <p> In the collective imagination of mainstream Pakistan , blasphemy is not a pardonable offense and anyone who believes otherwise is also committing blasphemy , and must similarly pay with their life . <p> Junaid Jamshed 's plea for mercy has raised a question about whether or not a repentant blasphemer may indeed be pardoned . <p> All were led to the question that Junaid Jamshed is currently plagued by : <p> Is blasphemy a pardonable offense ? <p> The answer , it is clear , was a categorical yes . <p> The stance that ' blasphemers who ask for a pardon would be spared the death penalty ' has already been established by the founder of the Hanafi school of thought , Abu Hanifa . <p> Within the Hanafi position , it simply does not go higher than Abu Hanifa , and it is the Hanafi school of thought that is foremost in significance , in terms of religio-legal debates in the Supreme Court , the Federal Sharia Court and the Council of Islamic Ideology . <p> Moreover , a long line of students and followers of Abu Hanifa , legal heavyweights of their respective eras , further corroborated this position in many of their works . Centuries of Hanafi scholarship have maintained the same categorical answer to our original question : Yes , blasphemy is a pardonable offense . <p> Keep in mind : as per the principles ( usul ) of the Hanafi jurisprudence , a consensus of Abu Hanifa and his students can not now be challenged . <p> This is one of the primary principles of taqlid in traditional Islamic legal thought . <p> The letter of the law 295-C makes no mention of the permissibility of pardoning a blasphemer . <p> In fact , it is a Federal Sharia Court interpretation of the law that serves as the operational blueprint of the application of the law , which rules out pardon . <p> They considered the same sources as listed above , and somehow reached the opposite conclusion : that the authoritative position of Imam Abu Hanifa and his students is that blasphemy is not , in fact , a pardonable offense . <p> How could this possibly have happened ? How could such a clearly stated position , maintained for centuries , be so misinterpreted ? <p> In my pursuit of answers , I discovered that in the 15th century a Hanafi scholar , Al-Bazzazzi , misquoted the Hanafi position on pardon that had been established since the time of Abu Hanifa . <p> It is important to note that he was not offering an alternative stance ; he meant to describe the original position but erroneously ended up misrepresenting it entirely . It is baffling to consider how he could have strayed so far from the original position . <p> Imam Ibn e Abidin , one of the most revered scholars in South Asia , chancing upon his erroneous depiction , was moved to write an impassioned critique of this divergent position -- not only explaining Bazzazzi 's error as a ' misreading of two important works ' ( Al Sarim-ul-Maslool ala Shatim-ur-Rasool by Ibn Taymiyyah and Al Shifa by Qadi Iyad ) , but also summarily dismissing the idea that blasphemy is unpardonable as " ridiculous " . <p> One of the most important scholarly figures in Islamic legal tradition , and one of the most revered figures in Deobandi madrassahs across Pakistan , Imam Ibn Abidin had the wisdom and foresight to warn that these competing narratives , if allowed to exist , would create undue confusion and chaos . He counseled the scholars to be meticulous in their research on the referencing of primary resources . <h> Where Pakistan 's laws came from <p> Advocate Ismaeel Qureshi , the architect of the blasphemy law , apparently did not get the memo . <p> In his best-selling book on blasphemy and his petition , Qureshi apparently built his case of an irrevocable death penalty , with no scope for pardon on the works of leading Hanafi authorities , and ironically , Imam Ibn Abidin himself . <p> In an a case of history repeating itself , he followed in Al-Bazzazzi 's footsteps in erroneously subverting the position of Imam Ibn Abidin . <p> At one point , in Fatawa e Shami , Ibn Abidin takes Bazzazzi 's claim -- ' the punishment for blasphemy is death , it is unpardonable and anyone who disagrees is also guilty of blasphemy ' -- dissects it and goes on to criticise it for the next six pages . <p> Advocate Ismaeel Qureshi , grasping the first thing he saw , slaps Imam Ibn Abidin 's name on to the very position that Abidin so passionately refuted right after quoting the original problematic claim . <p> When I learnt of this , I approached Advocate Ismaeel Qureshi with the primary text and showed him the counter-evidence to his assertions . <p> Qureshi acknowledged that mistakes had been made in the research upon which the judicial interpretation of Pakistan 's blasphemy law now rests . The history and process of how the events transpired to produce the law in its current form therefore , reads like a series of unfortunate errors . <p> The repercussions for those caught in the crossfire , are however , far more deadly than just ' unfortunate ' . <p> Why does no credible source from the mainstream religious leadership then step forward and set the record straight ? <p> It seems to be of greater importance to withhold the facts of the case , as a more open dialogue may also incidentally amount to collusion with the secular position -- surely , the worst of crimes . <p> In the midst of all this chaos and misinformation , there is still hope for the likes of Asia Bibi and Junaid Jamshed . <p> There is no need to change the letter of the blasphemy law for Junaid Jamshed and Asia Bibi to get their pardon . All that is required is to revisit the judicial interpretation , and rectify the erroneous conclusion of the Federal Sharia Court that was reached on the basis of dubious research . <p> The blasphemy law , according to the Hanafi position , allows for pardon . <h> Comments ( 233 ) Closed <p> Badar <p> Dec 09 , 2014 06:04pm <p> Great work Br .

I doubt if countries like Saudi Arabia would even allow such a discussion . <p> Recommend0 <p> reality bites <p> Dec 09 , 2014 07:19pm <p> I wonder why would a religious person plead for mercy from the court that is implementing this law . If he or she admits to blasphemy , then wait for God to pardon you when you get there . <p> It seems like even mullahs also do n't like the law , when they are accused of blasphemy . <p> What hypocrisy . <p> Recommend0 <p> Huda Jilani <p> Dec 09 , 2014 07:20pm <p> First , extremely brave guy and a very well-written piece .. When it comes to facts , yes , it should be proved first , if it is proved , the guilty gets a chance to make an apology , and can be pardoned .. This way , he is innocent .. However , those who want him hanged today have a very valid point .. The people who never bothered about the minorities being lynched over blasphemy accusations and those who actually spurred the whole fiasco , they do deserve a taste of their own medicine .. Emotionally , I 'd very well love to see him punished .. Third , the main insult was against women in general ..

The author wrote , " Qureshi acknowledged that mistakes had been made in the research upon which the judicial interpretation of Pakistan 's blasphemy law now rests . The history and process of how the events transpired to produce the law in its current form therefore , reads like a series of unfortunate errors " . Does this mean that Advocate Ismaeel Qureshi , Gen. Zia , and all those who supported and worked to add the current blasphemy law language into the constitution bear the responsibility of all the bloodshed that has taken place ? It is a great example of how much harm a thoughtless decision can cause . Needless to say that it is now the urgent duty of the current leadership and the highest judiciary to show courage , join hands , and amend the blasphemy law in the constitution . When Allah forgives , Prophet Mohammad ( Peace be Upon Him ) forgave his nemesis and tormentors , then why ca n't we . Islam is a religion of peace and tolerance . Let us get away from fanaticism . <p> I have big respect for Junaid Jamshead. he is a very pious person and AH he become role model for tens of thousands people around globe . people who are making issue just because of jealousy . <p> We must support him . <p> Recommend0 <p> String Theory <p> Dec 09 , 2014 07:47pm <p> So let me get this straight .

Its good to see this happening but what was the crime of other thousands unknown innocent people who have been killed even before having chance of fair trial in monkey courts . I feel shame to belong to country where we claim to be Muslim but do n't learn anything from history . Jew women used to through trash on our prophet PBUH and he never asked any of his companion to kill her under blasphemy man made issue . Shame on Pakistan society and leaders particular who are scared of extremist reaction and do n't repeal the law . Shame on lawyers who support Mumtaz Qadri mentality and have corrupted minds of millions by their actions . I have more respect for young Bilawal Bhotto who openly criticized Taliban and extremist . These extremist are becoming leaders as real Islamic scholars are keeping mouth shut or even leaving country for comfortable life standards . <p> Recommend0 <p> Khizr <p> Dec 09 , 2014 08:07pm <p> My hope is that the law is repealed and all that are implicated though it be released , including all non-muslims .

Technically the subject might be clear to a research minded person , however everyone must help in the following long term goals : 1 : Difference ( contrast ) of punishment for Non muslim blasphemer ' must be clarified again and again , by multiple authors , in multiple languages till the issue is clarified for all , it might take 20-25 years 2 : A point must be added to penal code regarding punishment of those who lynch blasphemers. 3 : ' Prayer leaders ' at small villages and localities must be reached as a mission to educate them about this issue . In 100% of lynching or ' mass protest ' cases the actual ignitors are illiterate ' prayer leaders ' who are not trained ' ulema ' from any school , rather they are accidentally in this ' profession ' . <p> Recommend0 <p> AdHawk <p> Dec 09 , 2014 08:42pm <p> By the way , the letter of the cited law ( 295 C ) as reproduced in the article clearly protects only the Prophet 's name and says nothing about his companions .

It was stated by so many ulema many time in my different speeches . If somebody did any sin even these sins are bigger then mountains it is pardonable . The only condition is that He /she should repent in front of Allah with sincercity . Not due to people pressure . In case of Junaid jamshed as he is muslim and believe Allah and his rasool so repentance of any muslim including JJ is acceptable Similarly in case of asia bibi if she is muslim then her repentance is acceptable also .

Its man made . The question you want to ask is why did the Rashidun ( 4 Caliphas ) caliphas ( RZ ) differ from each other in terms of their fatwas ? And why did they not author the perfect book of Sharia for all times ? <p> Answer is simple - Islam is an interpretive religion and meant for all times - conditions change , what we need to get from Sunnah are principles and practices and then device our own rules to live in these times , but those rules are not sacred , they are changeable . <p> Recommend0 <p> Ali <p> Dec 10 , 2014 01:17am <p> A very good write up .

It was argued that the one committing blasphemy becomes an apostate , and the existing fatwa for apostasy was death , which is why death was considered as a punishment for blasphemy as well . Since the fatwa for apostates allowed pardon if the apostate seeks forgiveness and returns to Islam , the same was allowed for the one who blasphemed . Secondly , a logical consequence of this context was that the law excluded non-Muslims by definition since the punishment for blasphemy was discussed in the context of apostasy of those Muslims who left Islam . <p> Recommend0 <p> Asad <p> Dec 10 , 2014 04:15am <p> Well researched article .

The option of life imprisonment was made defunct after a 1991 Federal Shariat Court judgement . <p> The edifice of Islam rests on Justice , if there is no justice there is no Islam .

Whilst he could have said all that in a better way but whatever he did say that does exist , although there was perhaps some addition to the original story . Surely it dint sound blasphemous in spirit to me . Lastly , as far as women 's right people are considered in short all he implied was women are different and moral of the story was that men should co-exist with them and not try to force and change their behavior to suit their own . He has nt said anything against women but actually for women , so Men in our society understand women better and do not impose things on them . My personal view is Men and Women are not equal , they are different physically and approach matters differently from psychological point of view . <p> Recommend0 <p> Hira <p> Dec 10 , 2014 04:55pm <p> A much needed elaboration on the most controversial and most frequently misinterpreted law in Pakistan . Everyone , especially those who feel the need to comment on the blasphemy law with absolutely no knowledge of it whatsoever , NEED to read this . A great initiative taken by Dawn in publishing this piece . Looking forward to reading more articles on this subject . <p> Recommend0 <p> Laeeq , NY <p> Dec 10 , 2014 05:01pm <p> For some writing such an article is itself blasphemous .

Were the founding fathers of both religions to have lived today , does anyone imagine for a moment that they would deliver their sermons/commandments etc in the language and manner that they did in those days ? I think the world has come a long way since then , and if you believe in the Almighty , then the world has evolved this far because the Almighty has wanted it to progress . If not , the all-powerful Almighty would have put a permanent stop to what often is our madness . <p> Recommend0 <p> Jehanzeb Khan <p> Dec 10 , 2014 06:48pm <p> Great work . I think what Junaid has Said was not a clear act of blasphemy rather mistakenly spoken words which are due to his lack of knowledge . Therefore the Tablikhi Hazrat should be advised , not to put forward everybody on the Member to deliver religious speeches . And how a Muslim can be derogatory and blasphemous regarding his own prophet ? This was just a stupid mistake of a former singer and recent Tablighi orator . He was not aware of Aadab e Guftago on religious topics .

@@4659237 lot has been written about Amitabh Bachchan , there is a dearth of material on the man whose throne he usurped . The man in question is , of course , Rajesh Khanna , who caused such a frenzy in India -- and likely in Pakistan too -- that he caused film journalists to coin the term ' superstar ' to describe him . While Bachchan continues to this day to be a part of the public sphere , mainly thanks to his ability to reinvent himself time and again , the same , sadly , can not be said of Khanna , who from the late 1980s until his death in 2012 remained almost invisible , a mere shadow of his former , glorious self . That was perhaps the biggest tragedy of Khanna 's life , given that he was larger than life and basked unashamedly in the adulation he once commanded . <p> For all these reasons , a book exploring his life by Gautam Chintamani -- a self-confessed cinephile -- is more than welcome . <p> Dark Star : The Loneliness of Being Rajesh Khanna attempts to chronicle the life of one of Hindi cinema @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have seemed over-the-top at time , but his earnestness and the occasional understated performances ( in films such as Amar Prem , Safar and Aavishkar ) can not be disputed . <p> " Rajesh Khanna , " writes the incomparable Sharmila Tagore in the foreword to this book , " is remembered primarily as a romantic actor . He had a vulnerable , lost air about him that made women of all ages feel very protective . I remember ... long queues of women from nine to 90 outside the studios where we worked . Some garlanded his car , some married his photograph , and others sent letters in blood . The hysteria was unprecedented . " <p> Khanna 's was n't a rag to riches story ; he came from a wealthy family , was adopted by his aunt and uncle at a young age , and was thoroughly spoilt by his biological and adoptive parents . Perhaps this environment nurtured his sense of entitlement , which eventually led to his downfall -- but more on that later . <p> Khanna 's film career began when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aimed to introduce new talent to Hindi cinema . And even though his first few films were quite forgettable , the first being Aakhri Khat ( 1966 ) , there was no looking back after Aradhana and Do Raaste ( which were released in November and December of 1969 ) ; Khanna had arrived , rocking the holy trinity of Dilip Kumar , Dev Anand and Raj Kapoor . <p> According to Chintamani , " the factor that contributed the most towards Khanna 's meteoric rise was his female fan following . For the men , Khanna represented the average man . They could identify with something that Shah Rukh Khan was able to do decades later but for the women he embodied something they had n't seen on screen ever before ... he was the first Hindi film star to bring to the screen the sensuality and even the sexuality of the hero without making a hue and cry about it . " Unfortunately for Khanna , though , " the highs of success can make anyone feel like God , and Rajesh Khanna ended up taking the analogy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as timings were concerned , was constantly late ( something that Tagore also attests to ) , and was fond of being surrounded by admirers and followers when at home -- at what he used to call his durbar . Khanna is also remembered as being theatrical in real life ; at one point in time he is believed to have said " aap ko humari durbar chorni paregi " to people with whom he had differences . However , as long as his films continued to make money , the producers put up with such behaviour . But then the winning streak came to an abrupt end . By 1972 the flops started outnumbering the hits , and " Hindi cinema 's first superstar had already begun his downward spiral and he was n't even 30 . " Khanna was scared of losing his stardom and it is alleged that a reason he married 16-year-old Dimple Kapadia , who played the title role in Raj Kapoor 's Bobby , was to reinvigorate his flailing career . <p> However , while " the Rajesh Khanna-Dimple Kapadia marriage did manage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it beyond a point . " In true Khanna fashion , there are stories that his baraat passed by his ex-girlfriend Anju 's house . <p> Even though Khanna managed to produce the occasional hit until the 1980s , and was paid on par with Bachchan , the former glory was never regained and Khanna turned to politics , where he did n't last too long . Soon Khanna was confined to his beloved bungalow , Aashirwad , away from the limelight and adulation . <p> What is missing in Dark Star are in-depth accounts of Khanna 's personal life ; this , Chintamani says , he stayed away from on purpose ( " the stories of his largess , his pettiness , his insecurities could fill pages but this book steers clear of anything overly salacious " ) . Unfortunately , this poses a problem when the title of the book is considered as Chintamani neither explains why Khanna was a ' dark star ' nor why he was lonely . <p> After all , if Khanna was a lonely man , what led to that loneliness ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he counted on his mannerisms much more than the scripts he chose ? Was his success due to luck or was it due to his considerable talent ? <p> While the book does pose these questions to an extent , it fails to answer them and tends to lack insights pertaining to the life of an enigmatic man who was as dramatic and theatrical in real life as he was in his reel life , and whose films are considered classics even today , making many of Bachchan 's films ( especially those of the 1980s ) seem misogynistic and crass in comparison . <p> Thus , while Dark Star is a commendable biography in so far as it chronicles its subject 's life in considerable depth , it can not be viewed as a complete biography . <h> Comments ( 1 ) Closed <p> smitha <p> Dec 08 , 2014 03:41pm <p> first of all , this review &amp; the book itself is contradictory . The author says that khanna 's flops were more than his hits after 1972 &amp; in the same breath adds that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Does he think producers are fools to make movies with him if he is a flop star ? <p> His success rate was no doubt dimmed but that was because no star , either before or after him , has had 16 consecutive blockbusters . <p> The success rate of his films are one of the highest in the hindi film industry . Also , it is acknowledged widely that he had a terrific script sense . U can sample many of this films &amp; U will know that this is true . <p> The author has written this book based on hearsay &amp; is full of errors &amp; lies . It shows people can go to any lengths to gain publicity &amp; make money . 
@@4659238 patient , you the people of God . You are here to please Allah Almighty and not for enjoyment . So bear with fortitude the inconvenience of waiting for your turn , " Ehsanullah , a fourth-year medical college student , consoled those queuing outside the venue for the Jamaatud Dawa 's two-day ijtema ( congregation ) on the sprawling lawns of Minar-i-Pakistan . <p> The participants were getting impatient as they waited in long queues at the five entrances to the venue , where JuD emir Hafiz Muhammad Saeed had begun his address at the concluding session . <p> The ijtema was an annual activity until the party , then named Lashkar-e-Taiba , was banned in 2002 after an attack on the Indian parliament allegedly carried out by its henchmen . From the ashes of the LeT ( claimed to have since been confined to Kashmir ) emerged Jamaatud Dawa . For the first time , the event was being held in the Punjab capital since the inception of the outfit in the mid-1980s , and after a break of almost 12 years . <p> Security arrangements were extraordinarily tight as organisers feared threats especially to the party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Besides 4,000 policemen , at least 15,000 volunteers were on duty . One had to cross three security rings besides passing through a long makeshift bazaar to reach the designated spot for male participants . Tighter security measures had been taken for the adjacent but separate area for burqa-clad female activists who , the organisers said , constituted a third of the total number of participants . <p> JuD spokesman Yahya Mujahid claimed they had prepared food for 400,000 people for dinner with the help of 2,500 cooks at the kitchen set up on the site but the arrangements proved inefficient . The local cadre had to be mobilised to arrange for more food from nearby eateries . <p> Most participants came from rural backgrounds , and it was hard to spot anyone without a beard . Though consisting largely of illiterate or semi-literate youth , many students , including those from engineering universities and medical colleges were present . Hafiz Saeed is a former faculty member of the University of Engineering &amp; Technology , Lahore , and many UET graduates like Naveed Qamar hold key positions in the outfit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they had turned up to get training for jihad . Naeemur Rehman , an IT expert , explained this as ' academic ' training through lectures and sermons , and not military instruction . The gathering of people with similar thinking in hundreds of thousands at one place also infused a new spirit of determination among the activists , he added . <p> Ilyas Salfi , a law graduate , argued that jihad was not confined to armed struggle but extended to helping those in distress through lawful means . The JuD 's rescue and relief work during the 2005 earthquake ( recognised by the UN ) , after the 2010 floods and later , and in the recent Thar crisis through its social welfare activities under the banner of Falah-i-Insaniyat Foundation were examples of jihad , he said . <p> Two Hindus from Sindh and a Christian impressed by JuD 's relief activities embraced Islam at the ijtema . <p> Notwithstanding its welfare activities , the group is banned by the US , the EU , India and Russia as a terrorist organisation . In June 2014 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Hafiz Saeed and Abdur Rahman Makki , JuD 's political wing chief and Saeed 's brother-in-law . <p> Unlike the festive atmosphere of the earlier rallies of the Pakistan Awami Tehreek and Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf at the same place a few weeks ago , the JuD congregation was a serious affair . In a show of equality and non-discrimination , leaders and participants sat on carpets and mats ; there was no chair for anyone , except a couple of security guards . <p> One heard the chants of " Allah-o-Akbar " , instead of party songs played by DJ Butt . An organiser said a principal objective was to show that the religious parties were a force to be reckoned with and that if secular parties ( a reference to the PTI and PAT ) could attract crowds at their ' dance and song ' gatherings , the JuD could draw larger crowds motivated by their desire to establish Islam 's supremacy . <p> An insider claimed that the outfit was to organise the event at its headquarters in Muridke and the sudden decision to change the venue was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen " as a response to the public meetings of secular parties " . He also hinted at the forging of a new religious alliance . <p> JuD spokesman Yahya Mujahid defended the decision to change the venue , saying Muridke could not accommodate so many people and that the provision of food and sanitation facilities in Lahore was much easier . He also said they tried to benefit from the arrangements the Jamaat-i-Islami made for its ijtema 10 days ago . <p> The outfit , like other jihadi and religious organisations , collects donations round the year , particularly zakat during Ramazan and hides of animals on Eidul Azha , to meet the expenses for its anti-India and pro-jihad campaigns . To cover the costs of the ijtema , participants were asked to donate generously in cash and kind . <p> " Please leave behind your beddings , blankets and shawls for the mujahideen . Your donations will earn you a higher place in the hereafter , " echoed the announcement made at the conclusion of the congregation .

It is quite important for India that people like Saeed keep the Kashmir issue burning so that the attention , focus and development of Pakistan is always held hostage to this one issue . It also ensures that Pakistan has to keep diverting its resources to defense and sacrifice its potential to develop or attract investments .

@@4659239 As teenage education activist Malala Yousafzai prepares to receive her Nobel Peace Prize , the government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa -- her hometown -- is pushing for Islamic content in school textbooks that critics claim promotes violent jihad . <p> Malala , 17 , is set to be awarded for her struggle against religious extremism and for the right of children , especially girls , to an education K-P -- where Taliban militants tried to kill her two years ago . <p> The challenge is enormous : some 25 million children aged from five to 16 in Pakistan are out of school , 14 million of them girls , according to education campaign group Alif Ailaan . <p> But the biggest debate surrounding education in KP is not how to improve attendance , hire more teachers or repair dilapidated infrastructure : instead , the regional government is attempting to determine how best to reclaim the curriculum in the name of Islam . <p> The move is being led by Jamaat-e-Islami , the junior member of the coalition led by Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf ( PTI ) . <p> " There are errors in current text books which go against our values , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The project foresees , for example , reintroducing verses of the Koran that deal with jihad ( holy war ) , and adding passages on the divine creation of the universe into science textbooks . <p> It also envisages rolling back changes made during the last period of reform , 2006 , when authorities " removed religious chapters on social science texts " to replace them with " chapters on Nelson Mandela , Karl Marx , Marco Polo , Vasco de Gama and Neil Armstrong , " according to the minister . <p> They also want to pull primary school textbooks that depict girls without veils . <p> " We live in an Islamic society , women do n't wear skirts here , " said Khan . <p> The project , confirmed by provincial education minister Atif Khan , pertains to public schools as well as those private schools which do not have the means to procure their own texts -- covering the vast majority of students in the province . <p> Emphasis on Islam in non-religion related school texts began as early as the 1960s , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dictator Ziaul Haq . The PPP and the PML-N , project a more moderate vision . <h> Fightback ? <p> In response to the provincial government 's plan , Sharif has launched a counter-attack by ordering the Higher Education Commission to seek changes to all texts , from primary to university level , to promote the country 's " democratic " heritage over its history of coups . <p> The main problem however is that following recent devolution steps it is the provinces , not the central government , that have the final say on curriculum in order to cater to the region 's particular cultural and linguistic values . <p> " There is a lot of confusion at the moment , " with some provinces refusing to allow the central government to participate in the writing of texts , explains A.H .

" <p> A recent US study of 100 Pakistani school texts found that minorities -- especially Hindus -- were depicted as " second-class " citizens and " enemies of Islam " . <p> The rhetoric is even more worrying for the country 's liberals than the rising number of attacks on religious minorities , saying it lays the groundwork for further radicalisation . <p> Even the country 's Western donors , who give millions of dollars in education aid , are privately worried about the " re-Islamisation trend " . <p> Others see it as simply a populist move with little chance of succeeding in the short term .

Thanks a lot Imran . <p> Recommend0 <p> Mariam <p> Dec 10 , 2014 02:56pm <p> PTI really needs to keep a check on JI . Giving them control over the curriculum is not a good move . <p> Some educated people really need to get together and come up with a uniform curriculum for all the provinces . No one should have the right to make changes as they see fit , as it benefits them religiously or politically . There should be an independent body . <p> Recommend0 <p> Zoaib <p> Dec 10 , 2014 03:10pm <p> It seems there 's a lot of exaggeration about what exactly is being " introduced " in the curriculum . In reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly subjective . Curriculum is the least of KP govt 's concern at the moment . Teacher attendance has been markedly improved through increased monitoring ( IMU ) , teachers shortage is being filled through NTS based recruitments and there is focus on school infrastructure through budgetary allocations and also programs like Tameer e School . Many more such initiatives started esp for girls education . Sad that this got no mention here ... <p> Recommend0 <p> Hassan Jamil <p> Dec 10 , 2014 03:10pm <p> Jihad can be something as simple as trying to earn a halal livelihood . There is nothing wrong with the word ' jihad ' itself . It is important that it is highlighted in a positive and meaningful way . This could result in influencing the younger generation to learn the right meaning of jihad in broader sense and actually prevent them from engaging in harmful practices related to this issue . <p> Recommend0 <p> Mariam <p> Dec 10 , 2014 03:33pm <p> @Zoaib I agree that all the good things should be mentioned .

Kids should be taught to think critically , learn different point of views and should have the ability to question facts vs fiction .

To those who support the move to islamise the curriculum , please consider this ; how does presenting a completely false idealised picture of pakistani society benefit our youth ?

Its like marginalizing knowledge so that nobody can be sure in the end what was actually correct .
