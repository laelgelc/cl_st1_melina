Hindu Maharaja 's police had killed 22 innocent Kashmiri Muslims on 13 July 1931 . RSS arms bearing volunteers went to Kashmir as a supplement to the Maharaja 's forces .

The then government while admitting this demand and analyzing its importance and need of such action , declared February 5 as National Kashmir Solidarity day in 1991 .

Even the continuous and ever intensified unprovoked firing , attacks and bombings LoC , in the world 's highest altitude military standoff , Siachen and adjoining regions is causing huge loss of lives of innocent Kashmiri 's on both the sides .

The world has admitted the operation preparedness , extreme professional command over military technology by Pakistani forces and also their commitment to protect the sovereignty of Pakistan .

The technological advancement of Pakistani scientists and engineers in the field of nuclear armament and the successful development of TNW 's ( Tactical Nuclear Weapons ) has further signaled the world that the threat of nuclear war is real and the standoff between both the countries is alarming . <p> Since came into power , the present government has taken up the issue of Kashmir and Indian repression against innocent Kashmiris at all the international forums . <p> Prime Minister Imran Khan and Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi has made the issue of Kashmir as their foremost priority of foreign policy and took this issue not only at United Nations General Assembly-UNGA , Security Council , world economic forum , SCO , OIC and all other platforms but also lobbying at every bilateral or multilateral interactions .

While Tesla launches production in China and lays the foundation to build cars in Germany , Ford has been closing plants in Europe and South America and GM has struggled to completely shake the effects of a 40-day strike last year that effectively shut down its US operation . <p> Shares of Ford plunged 9.4 percent in early-afternoon trading to $8.31 , while GM was up 0.2 percent at $34.45 . But after its dizzying rise , Tesla shares slumped 18.6 percent to $722.58 on Wednesday as investors took profits following a stunning surge the last two sessions that lifted shares by more than 36 percent .

Chief Executive James Hackett acknowledged that execution of the new Explorer " was simply not nearly good enough " and that " we 've taken steps to address these shortfalls .

" <p> GM said a 40-day strike that shuttered US factories dented fourth-quarter profits by $2.6 billion , bringing the total negative impact for 2019 to $3.6 billion . The US auto giant suffered a fourth-quarter loss of $194 million , compared with $2 billion in profits in the same period a year earlier , while revenues fell 19.7 percent to $30.8 billion .

@@51428232 <h> The Mystique of Courts , Judges , and Lawyers <p> Towards the end of his tenure , I had the privilege of witnessing Chief Justice Saqib Nisar 's decisions , rulings and orders firsthand . As I was still undergoing law school , albeit reaching the end thereof , my rather callow practical understanding of the organs of the state began to view Nisar as an impeccable and omnipotent entity , and his office as effectively the most powerful instrument of the state . I was enrolled in an internship programme in the Advocate General , Punjab 's office . Luckily , the office was situated inside the building of the Supreme Court in the federal capital , Islamabad , and thus it was very convenient for me to hear the proceedings almost throughout the weeks . <p> Sitting in Nisar 's courtroom initially felt like a spitting image of a layperson 's or of a young law student 's ( aspiring to pursue a career in law immaturely for the sole purpose of fighting injustice ) imaginary idea of a court duty-bound to deliver justice . A judge passionately protecting the underprivileged from injustice , while strictly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizen expects to witness . Nisar fairly fit that description . However , beneath this zealous bona fide aura were strata of self-centeredness , self-righteousness and a lust for fame , all of which surfaced as soon as ( in a few days ) I had let the first impression sink in . <p> Often and , in fact , on most days one could hear him deliver harangues and it would not be an overstatement that he was running a marathon of censures . Moreover , it was not rare to find him seizing the slightest of the opportunities to go off on a tangent , discussing at length issues or points not relevant to the dispute at hand and not argued by the counsel/s . A trend which , at least to me , became particularly noteworthy was that his speech usually assailed popular figures , senior public officials and bureaucrats , and owners of big corporations and wealthy businessmen . In other words , anyone who was in a position of social status and power higher than , equal to or a little less than his , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , he rather ostentatiously tended to lend a sympathetic judicial ear to the downtrodden and the poor and needy . He would rule in favor of this class even in cases where the law was not ready to afford them redress . Instead of being based on principles of law and legality , his reasoning in several rulings appeared to be based more on grounds of his personal notion of morality , virtually divorced from law and was characterized by an emotive effort to engender populism and moralism . <p> The number of suo moto cases under Article 184(3) of the Constitution of Pakistan which allows the Supreme Court to exercise original jurisdiction skyrocketed . Concerns arose as to whether the Supreme Court was overstepping its jurisdiction by artificially extending this constitutional provision . It appeared as if the judiciary was overtly playing the role of the executive during a period of political turmoil , which is a blatant violation of the venerated doctrine of separation of power . One such case was that of the Pakistan Kidney &amp; Liver Institute ( PKLI ) . After Nisar 's tenure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headed by Justice Manzoor Ahmad Malik . The bench while observing the need for every institution to work within its limits and strictly avoid actions ultra vires , quashed all previous orders made by Nisar , and called the corruption inquiry ordered by him uncalled-for and an instance of judicial overreach . <p> Nisar , who was soon joined by Prime Minister Imran Khan , initiated a dam fund to counter the crisis of water shortage , urging the Pakistani population to make donations . It later transpired that this project was a farce , a Ponzi scheme of sorts which misled the nation when it was revealed that the government was spending these funds to pay its utility bills . The amount collected -- which includes involuntary contributions through deductions from the salaries of government servants and military personnel -- is roughly Rs. 10 billion which makes a meager one percent of the project cost which renders it a fiasco as well as a farce . <p> Anyone who has heard about Malik Riaz has also heard about his questionable character . People either identify him as a tycoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grabbing mafia or as both . Be that as it may , it is a natural corollary of the right to a fair trial and a requirement of the due process of law that the accused be treated respectfully inside the court . Nisar , on the other hand , wasted no opportunity to lambast Riaz in open court during a number of proceedings . It appeared as if Nisar held a vendetta against him or his success . Despite Riaz 's dubious credibility in the eyes of the general public , he was perfectly entitled to be presumed innocent until proven guilty . <p> For the former premier Nawaz Sharif 's counsel , it was almost never a nice day to argue with Nisar in court . In one of Nawaz 's cases , he was represented by an eminent attorney named Khawaja Harris . Harris was only sparingly afforded the opportunity to present his arguments fully and received a special hostility from Nisar . Other attorneys of similar stature were treated more politely or less vehemently , and simply not equally . I witnessed Harris ' exasperated countenance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even failed to hold back a reaction . In a different case , Nawaz was represented by an ordinarily recognized lawyer , Munawar Hussain Duggal . It is safe to say that he was insulted by Nisar when he was questioned brazenly if at all he had ever actually been hired by Nawaz . Nisar while questioning his competence , inquired sarcastically ' Have you ever even met Nawaz Sharif ? ' To say the least , such disparaging remarks must have taken more than a negligible toll on Duggal 's self-confidence as an advocate and a heavy toll on Nisar 's reputation as an impartial judge . <p> Another notorious move by Nisar was the abrupt reconstitution of a three-judge bench into a two-judge one in a human rights case when he decided , on his whim , to exclude Justice Faez Isa Qazi after the latter had expressed doubts regarding the applicability of Article 184(3) to the matter at hand . Apparently , Isa J was guilty of an attempt to ensure the relevance , suitability , and applicability of a constitutional provision to the matter in question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lengths , and of being wary of the court overstepping its jurisdiction . Clearly such concerns hardly seemed to ever bother Nisar who had developed a mania for the invocation of this provision . Isa J later criticized this bold move as ' unwarranted and unprecedented ' , adding that it ' undermines the integrity of the system and may have serious repercussions . ' Justice Mansoor Ali Shah who was the second judge in the newly constituted bench , while expressing serious concerns about the impartiality and independence of the judiciary , described Nisar 's decision as an attempt to ' silence dissent or dampen an alternative viewpoint ' . Furthermore , it is highly likely to have violated Order XI of the Supreme Court Rules 1980 which deals with the ' Constitution of Benches ' . <p> His motive of enthusiastically protecting the ' Fundamental Rights ' where a matter of ' public importance ' was relevant unfortunately seemed only inadequately sincere . Beneath the apparent cause of serving justice and humanity , there was an underlying urge ( or rapacity ) to become noteworthy and popular . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was underlying was more visible and discernible . <p> Nisar 's tendency to indulge in a loose talk led him to deliver a sexist statement during a speech at a public forum . He quoted the former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill 's statement : " A good speech should be like a woman 's skirt ; long enough to cover the subject and short enough to create interest . " This suggestive comment received quite a backlash on social media and was particularly taken up by the Women Action Forum , which organization , backed by another organization , namely the Women Lawyers Association , called upon Nisar to issue a public apology to the women of Pakistan . <p> I agree as many would , that individual 's occupying prime offices must not be judged by superhuman standards . Having said that , it is perfectly reasonable to expect such individuals to conduct themselves in an extraordinarily responsible manner and to utilize their influential positions to promulgate better , progressive ideas in society , and to act and speak with political correctness . <p> It is difficult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner .

Or was it simply judicial activism , which is often perceived as having positive and decent connotations ?

And yet , I am angry . Angry at the many agencies and design houses which decided not to participate and angrier still at the employees of these companies who did not ask to attend . This is not me sitting on my high horse looking down . I am looking up in frustration , mostly directed at myself . I should have spoken sooner . ( Insert slapping forehead emoji here . ) <p> This was a missed opportunity for everyone for so many obvious reasons . Yet there are further underlying reasons that were ignored by the heads of companies and their employees . Here are some of the missed opportunities . ( And no , I am not a spokesperson for AdAsia ; I am only a member of the industry. ) <h> 1 .

And , instead of being shunned , that tough beat became the most sought after one . The precinct 's arrest rate went up , crime went down and morale went up . Nothing else changed in that precinct .

But how does one discern who is worth following ? Who is worth their salt and has a well thought out and practical process or method to follow ?

As he has had to explain again and again , he was talking about platforms not about the fact that these entities are selling things they do not own . <h> Ryan Wallman <p> I have a confession to make . I have never watched a single episode of Mad Men . And I am not a fan of Don Draper . In the library of my department at KU , I came across the autobiography of Lester Wundermann , the father of interactive advertising .

@@51579232 <p> LAHORE : Leading businessmen and economists believe Pakistan is moving from stagflation to recession amid the coronavirus ( COVID- 19 ) pandemic in the country . <p> Talking to Pakistan Today , leading industrialist Waleed Tariq Saigol said the country is headed towards a recession owing to the unprecedented disruption caused by the virus . <p> " The world has taken measures to survive for 2-3 months in the current lockdown mode . Anything longer or a second wave of infection would send things into a further tailspin . This will be catastrophic for the global economy as well as for emerging markets like Pakistan . Exports , remittances , jobs etc. will all be badly hit , " he feared . <p> The industrialist believed that a global recession right now is a nightmare scenario for emerging market economies , as these are highly dependent on developed markets for capital inflows . <p> Meanwhile , economic expert and tax consultant Dr Ikramul Haq believed that the country is already in recession following a long period of stagflation . " Even before the coronavirus outbreak , the economy had fallen due to onerous taxation , high interest rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( IMF ) programme , " he maintained . <p> Dr Haq explained that technically , a temporary recession is defined as a period of economic decline during which trade and industrial activities are reduced , generally identified by a fall in Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) in two successful quarters . <p> " Our economy has been contracting for the past several months . After the imposition of lockdowns , we are in deep recession . " <p> Dr Haq suggested that if the government wants to avoid further stagnation after lockdowns , Prime Minister Imran Khan must announce a comprehensive relief plan for real estate , housing and construction sectors . <p> " These sectors should be given at least a 10-year tax holiday . " <p> He continued that the said relaxation is of utmost importance as over 40 industries are linked to the construction industry , adding that time is appropriate for the government to provide the real estate sector with a much-needed boost . <p> " The construction industry in return must provide complete social protection and universal entitlements to their workers as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully documents its affairs . " <p> He said that no protection should be given to any kind of tainted money . <p> Agreeing with them , Ghazanfar Azzam , President and Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) at Mobilink Microfinance Bank , said not just Pakistan , the world economy as a whole has already entered into one of the most severe recessions ever experienced . <p> Azzam feared that each and every day would bring new challenges in terms of job losses , falling production , declining trade , collapsing healthcare and food security . <p> " We need to implement better discipline , ensure social distancing , and seal our borders till the pandemic is over . At the moment , the focus should be to save people from disease and hunger . " <p> Adviser to Punjab Chief Minister and seasoned economist Dr Salman Shah also feared that the lockdown of factories would lead to a collapse in jobs , income and consumption . <p> " The economy will move into a dangerous imbalance of demand and supply . " <p> Talking to this scribe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ejaz said the government needs to spend on the health sector and also need to draft policy to help the private sector retain jobs . Otherwise , as highlighted by PM Imran , the impact on jobs would be bigger than the health crisis , Ejaz feared . <p> Economist Hina Ayra said the only realistic response is a lockdown with complete focus on the supply of essential items . She said that the poor should be given maximum financial support either in the form of cash or ration to avoid social disorder , and that the hospitals should be stocked with all necessary medicines along with helping doctors and paramedics . <p> SCS Securities CEO Naushad Chamdia noted that as per the IMF , Pakistan is already in recession . <p> " This virus will bring the whole world economy down . Many economists see China as a world superpower as we come out of this crisis , " Chamdia predicted .

@@51579233 <h> The obsession with a low-interest rate <p> Just like the rules of war and laws of nature , economic principles have a way of punishing with vengeance those who defy them . Over the last couple of months , a troublingly ill-informed narrative was built around the interest rate regime in Pakistan . Firstly , the entire debate was a victim of the media 's sciolism and devoid of any mention of the real interest rate . Second , a strawman argument was built around how the increase in interest rate will do little to curb inflation caused by supply-side policies . Third , the link between the interest rate and the government 's deficit financing was totally ignored . And lastly , the consequences of lowering interest rates for exchange rate stability were never brought into question . <p> Real interest rate is what investors actually earn in real terms . It takes out the effect of inflation from the nominal interest rate . The policy rate set by the State Bank is a nominal interest rate . Suppose that the policy rate is 12 percent while inflation is 9 percent , then the real rate that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is always based on real -- not nominal -- interest rate . <p> Consequently , all household and business decision making including consumption , saving and investment responds to the real interest rate . When Central Banks lower interest rates they are making it cheaper to borrow and essentially pushing the economy to take risk , with the hope of more investment leading to higher economic growth . Though most of the time , fluctuations in nominal interest rates reflect changes in inflation more than changes in real interest rate . <p> It is true that high real interest rates stifle investment , make it harder for businesses to expand and ultimately hurt economic growth . The question is if we actually had a high real interest rate ? For the record , if it has any weight , the real interest rate in Pakistan has actually been lower than in the past few years . According to IMF data , Pakistan had a real interest rate of 7.12 percent in 2012 , 8.32 in 2016 and 5.91 in 2018 while according to unofficial estimates it was 5.30 in 2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was 5.70 . <p> Why do we then have a narrative built around prohibitively high interest rates in 2019 but not in 2015-2016 ? The answer is that our media pundits are looking at nominal interest rates which have indeed been the highest in a decade . To be fair , some businesses bear a disproportionate cost of higher nominal rates . One may question that if real interest rates are unchanged then why do some businesses find it relatively expensive to borrow ? Suppose that the State Bank raises nominal rates in line with inflation to keep the real interest rate unchanged . An average business should be able to raise prices in line with inflation and be able to pay a higher nominal -- yet unchanged real -- interest rate . Some businesses , however , are unable to pass on higher prices to consumers but end up having to pay a higher nominal rate and consequently a higher real interest rate . Macroeconomic policy , of course , is never built to cater to a few businesses or a specific industry . <p> For the sake of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest rate in the first place must be studied with a fuller and impartial perspective . If the government borrows money to finance a payback of a loan or to finance its spending , it will borrow from the existing pool of limited national savings . A higher interest rate increases the pool of savings and makes it easier to borrow . As the Advisor on Finance pointed out , the government has to repay Rs5000 billion in two years . A high interest rate incentivises lending to the government . If the government fails to raise these funds , it will have to ask the State Bank to accommodate its deficit by printing money -- which will be inflationary . So far , the economy has experienced double-digit supply-side inflation but if a massive loan payback is financed by monetary accommodation it will unleash an even bigger wave of demand-side inflation . Choosing between price stability and economic growth , most Central Banks sacrifice growth to maintain price stability as is their primary mandate . <p> Contrary to what some media pundits have alleged , a high interest rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bank deliberately seeks short-term investment that can evaporate in days . In absence of long-term foreign investment , any short-term investment is still welcome to bridge a funding gap which would otherwise have to be bridged with a Eurobond auction . Hot money inflow is better than no money inflow , and a prospective first step towards medium term investment , granted macro stability . <p> During global slow down , investors rush to safe havens such as USD denominated assets . At a time when the US nominal rate is at zero percent and the real interest rate is in negative territory , investors are still rushing to buy US assets . In the last month , the US dollar saw a non-trivial appreciation against a basket of currencies . For reference , the US dollar rose 12 percent against the British Pound and 28 percent against the Mexican Peso . In the last sixty days investors have pulled out $83bn from emerging markets . Economic slowdowns increase the risk premium for emerging markets , which might seem unfair , but investor preferences are not driven by the principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead to capital flight and pressure on the exchange rate which can be a crisis in its own right . <p> It is not to say that any fiscal stimulus or monetary easing is a bad idea , but that its consequences must be fully understood . Reducing the debate to simplistic ideas as discussed on talk shows is dangerous , to put it politely .

@@51580236 <h> Trump forces General Motors to produce ventilators <p> President Donald Trump issued an order last week that seeks to force General Motors ( GM ) to produce ventilators for coronavirus patients under the Defence Production Act . <p> Trump said negotiations with General Motors had been productive , but our fight against the virus is too urgent to allow the give-and-take of the contracting process to continue to run its normal course . <p> Trump , who had previously been reluctant to use the act to force businesses to contribute to the coronavirus fight , said GM was wasting time and that his actions will help ensure the quick production of ventilators that will save American lives . The GM is among the farthest along of US companies trying to repurpose factories to build ventilators . It is working with Ventec Life Systems , a small Seattle-area ventilator maker , to increase the company 's production and GM will use its auto electronics plant in Kokomo , Indiana to make the machines . <p> Experts say that no matter how many ventilators companies can crank out , it may not be enough to cover the entire need , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now being hit hard with critical virus cases . GM said it can build 10,000 ventilators per month starting in April with potential to make even more . <p> US hospitals now have about 65,000 ventilators fully capable of treating severe coronavirus patients . They could cobble together about 170,000 , including some simpler versions that would not work in all cases , said Dr Lewis Rubinson , chief medical officer at Morristown Medical Center in New Jersey and lead author of a 2010 medical journal article on the matter . <p> Some 960,000 people in the US will need to be on ventilators at one point or another during the crisis , according to an estimate made in February by Dr James Lawler , an associate professor and infectious disease specialist at the University of Nebraska Medical Center . Rubinson said it is unlikely the US would need that many ventilators at the same time , estimating it will need more like 300,000 fairly quickly . If social distancing works , people will get sick at different times , allowing hospitals to use ventilators on multiple patients . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tissue in the lungs , making it hard for them to deliver oxygen to the blood . Pneumonia can develop , along with a more severe and potentially deadly condition called acute respiratory distress syndrome , which can damage other organs . <p> After Trump invoked the act , GM said in a statement that it has been working around the clock for more than a week with Ventec and parts suppliers to build more ventilators . The company said its commitment to build Ventecs ventilators has never wavered . Trump said from the Oval Office last week that the government thought it had a deal for 40,000 ventilators but GM cut the number to 6,000 and talked about a higher price than previously discussed . <p> " We did not want to play games with them , " he said later that evening during his daily briefing , adding that GM now agrees with him and he may be able to end the enforcement of the act .

Peter Navarro , White House trade adviser , said officials worked with more than 10 companies to get ventilators , including Ford and General Electric , and nearly all have been cooperative . But the government had problems with GM and Ventec , he said . " We can not afford to lose a single day , " he said . <p> GM asserts that it is offering resources to Ventec at cost . Ventec , not GM , is talking with the government , and the only changes Ventec has made have been at the government 's request , said Chris Brooks , the company 's chief strategy officer . GM would merely be a contract manufacturer for Ventec , he said . <p> Ventec ventilators , which are portable and can handle intensive care patients , cost about $18,000 each , Brooks said . That 's much cheaper than the more sophisticated ventilators used by hospitals that can cost up to $50,000 , he said . <p> The Federal Emergency Management Agency has made multiple requests for estimates of how many ventilators it can build at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to Brooks . That could slow Ventec 's efforts to ramp up production because it does not know how many breathing machines it must build , he said . <p> Trump invoked the Defence Production Act soon after a series of tweets last week attacking GM and CEO Mary Barra . The president also cajoled Ford to build ventilators fast . Ford responded that it is pulling out all the stops . <p> It was a dramatic shift in tone from the night before , when the president told Fox News that pleas by hospitals for more ventilators are exaggerated . <p> " I have a feeling that a lot of the numbers that are being said in some areas are just bigger than they are going to be " , he said . <p> I do not believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators , " Trump continued .

Mali has been struggling to contain an Islamist insurgency that erupted in the north in 2012 , and which has claimed thousands of military and civilian lives . On Friday , Cisse 's Union for the Republic and Democracy ( URD ) party said in a statement that the party leader and three others remain in captivity . Unidentified gunmen had attacked Cisse 's convoy -- which was carrying over a dozen people -- when he was campaigning in his electoral district in central Mali on March 25.

But this being a mother 's nightmare , the son rose up from beneath the concrete rubble , unscathed . She held him close and said , unbelievingly , " You 're alive ? " seeking his confirmation against her doubting mind . <p> He said he was all right . <p> " How could you have possibly survived that ? " asked the mother , grateful but still sceptic . <p> " I live because the tower fell , " said the son , cryptically . <p> In the wide-awake world , Mashal is dead . He did not stand up , dusting his white clothes -- a colour he loved -- after his brutal lynching at the Abdul Wali Khan University Mardan ( AWKUM ) on April 13 , 2017 . A day later , he would be brought home to his mother , a chilling personification of her nightmare , knuckles broken , skull shattered . She would not recognise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arm that , when he was born , everyone found auspicious because it looked like " Allah " etched on his skin . <p> Sitting in Mashal 's whitewashed room with his pictures lined on the wall , she speaks of how , on many a night , she found him here reading late , falling asleep with a book on his chest . She says she raised her son like others raise their daughters -- protecting him from the outside world . " I worried about the radicalising influence of mullahs and terrorists . I taught my children religion at home because I felt I knew it better than what they teach . " <p> To keep her children safe , Syeda Bibi raised a tower that , if you believe in the symbolism of dreams , is an ancient maternal archetype in the psychology of Swiss psychoanalyst Carl Jung . When she dreamed of that tower collapsing , it was perhaps a forewarning of her own undoing at the terrible death of her child . But there are other towers , in tarot and in verse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but portend forces bent upon destruction . <p> She -- and Mashal 's father Iqbal Khan -- knew of the dark towers occupied by sinister forces . Not as believers in the occult or dream archetypes but as thinking citizens of Pakistan , where nightmares have a way of creeping into real life . This fear of dark forces may or may not be Jung 's ' collective unconscious ' of a nation playing out in our dreams ; but who can deny that it has become our collective consciousness in today 's Pakistan -- a wakeful state where the terrifying vision of nihilistic , anarchic hordes running amok in Hollywood 's Mad Max : Fury Road have come to resemble our own ? <p> Reel versus reality memes that juxtaposed the death-faced Immortan Joe with a gasmasked Khadim Hussain Rizvi , the cleric who laid a violent siege to Islamabad for the better part of November 2017 with a mob fed on religious frenzy , made the chilling parallels darkly comic . <p> But for Mashal 's parents and those of us who seek to protect our precious little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only brought home brutal , stark truths about Pakistani society . Blasphemy -- invoking mullahs and rampaging mobs intent on murder , challenging the authority of a state in whose dark towers they were bred -- like Frankenstein 's monster patched together from lies , distortions and hate . When the monster rose , it sought to bring down its own creator . <p> Like Robert Browning 's Childe Roland , who came to the Dark Tower ( more so as the poem came to Browning in a dream ) , Mashal would come to AWKUM to be part of " The Band " -- to seek and strive for truth in the face of failure and death . Recall the blind rage , the animal state of the lynch mob drunk on misguided righteousness , to see how ill-equipped was he who called himself a humanist -- and by extension those who may identify with that ideal . <p> Ill-equipped to believe that his youthful idealism fired up by the ' mad poet ' Ghani Khan 's verse and Bacha Khan 's non-violent politics would help him fashion a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , much less negotiate a fatal encounter with bloodthirsty forces bent upon tearing down that world . When they came for Mashal , they did not ask him to give an account of Shams Tabrizi 's Forty Rules of Love ( he read and recommended to friends Turkish author Elif ? Shafak 's novel The Forty Rules of Love ) for they would not know , much less care for , Tabrizi 's world view . <p> Iqbal Khan does not tire of asking as to how he was to know that his son would be killed in a university , emphasising the hallowed nature of a tower raised to scholarship . " We did n't send him to university to be killed there , " he says . <p> Is it any surprise that the university is located in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa where , in 2016 , the government refused to revise radical syllabi for fear of antagonising religious parties and donated 300 million rupees to a madrasa known to have hatched the Taliban ? In a country where the state harbours zealots , and mobs susceptible to spontaneous combustion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have of clearing their names of deadly accusations , however false ? <p> " It is not as if students decided out of the blue to kill Mashal , " says Shahab Khattak , a lawyer helping Mashal 's family fight the court case against his killers . " Their syllabi and outlook were shaped by the Afghan War . Our electronic media promotes extremism and the world powers active in the region want that psyche because it serves them . " <p> Amidst a grove of poplars now sleeps Mashal , in a grave that in its length and breadth is more a tribute to his stature in death than his size in life . It is longer and wider than he was but in these parts a martyr -- or a saint -- is known by the size of his burial place . His father speaks of him as if he is still alive and plans to build a mausoleum here , with a resting place for tired travellers . <p> But even in death , Mashal is not safe ; there are three police guards at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he blasphemed . No one has attempted to but there have been public threats from religious groups . Among them is Shujaul Mulk , a Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam -- Fazl leader in Mardan , who consecrates Mashal 's killers as ghazis or Muslim warriors . <p> A nationalist , a socialist , a humanist and a Sufi is how his friends and associates describe Mashal who died because he lived by these ideals . To this , his family would add the honorific ' martyr ' -- a title disputed by those who accuse him of blasphemy , contrary to the findings of a joint investigation team that absolved him of the charge . Instead the team accused the university administration of using blasphemy as a murder tool to silence a voice that spoke up about rampant corruption , political patronage , nepotism and violation of student rights on campus . <p> Mashal was born after six days of torrential rain in Zaida village of Swabi district . Clouds split at his arrival , says his mother . Because he brought sunshine , they named him Mashal -- a beacon of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eager to go to school at the age of three . Barely out of high school , he asked his teacher Younas Khan , who often delegated coaching of fellows students to his bright pupil , if he could volunteer as a teacher at the school . " He was the kind of student who I knew would accomplish whatever goals he set for himself , " says Younas Khan . <p> A scholarship earned for excelling in his matric exams brought Mashal to the Institute of Computer and Management Sciences , a college in Peshawar . When visiting his village , he would proudly show his mother billboards put up by his college in Swabi , bearing his portrait as an outstanding student . <p> Iqbal Khan at his son 's grave <p> Being a top student at college earned him another scholarship to study engineering in Russia . There is little known about his time in Moscow except that he did not finish his degree and returned because , as his friend Aitezaz Hassan says , he felt Russia had no need for him . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mashal told Hassan . " The folks there would be out partying while I would fast ( in Ramzan ) . " He said to Ziaullah Hamdard , that " roads and buildings are fine in Russia . I am needed here . " Hamdard was a journalism instructor at AWKUM who resigned after holding the university administration responsible for Mashal 's death . <p> Back home from Russia , he found his friends in the village gone , studying in cities . Although an extrovert , Mashal turned into a loner , says Hassan . He would spend time reading books in the fields where he is now buried . He told his mother to " tell father I am not an average student " perhaps because he sensed that giving up a professional degree might have shaken his father 's confidence in him . He told Hamdard something similar -- that his father was not happy that he had given up engineering -- and added that " my mission is to serve humanity and I can do it best with journalism " . <p> For Iqbal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mashal 's stay in Russia had meant accumulating debts . But when his son said he wanted to study journalism , he understood because he knew Mashal had literary inclinations . <p> Mashal was nothing if not his father 's son -- and not just in thoughts and action but also in body language . Watching videos where he decries corruption in the university or speaks for animal rights , one is reminded of how uncanny the resemblance is . It is easy to imagine that Iqbal Khan , a poet with a reformist , revolutionary streak and views steeped in left-wing activism and politics , has genetically passed on his liberal leanings to Mashal . <p> He once called his father a ' wizard with words ' -- except that his father 's progressive bent is imbued in the entire household , boldly conspicuous in his daughter , Stooriya Khan , whom Mashal coached . " To be Iqbal Lala 's son meant he was born into an institution , " says Liaqat Yousafzai . Yousafzai is an associate of Iqbal Khan 's in several sociopolitical movements and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the village 's cleric refused to offer his funeral prayer . <p> " He was not a child with a closed mind . Most of us go through life as if blind ; he was all-seeing , " says Yousafzai . Najeeb , a friend of Mashal 's , says he read avidly , followed current affairs and had acquired a socialist outlook on issues -- " perhaps because of his stay in Russia " . He would question everything around him that society does not want to touch , adds Najeeb . " Teachers and ulema do n't have the scholarship to provide answers to those questions and so they resort to violence . " <p> From what his friends and family tell of Mashal , it appears he was deeply aware of his place in this world . Like his humble father who does not mince words while speaking uncomfortable truths , the son spoke his mind with the unreserved intensity -- some say arrogance -- of someone who knew better . <p> This heightened sense of self also came from leadership qualities that earned him a fan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among many others . Fellow students employ diverse epithets to describe him : " proud " , " modest " , " nonconformist " and " instigator " . But all agree he was brilliant . Physically and intellectually vain , he spent time in the gym and preened for pictures with his Elvis Presley quiff -- besides debating serious issues in the classroom and on social media . <p> And yet , he was deeply caring towards people and animals , taking issue with the university administration on student rights , leading strikes against high tuition fees , raising funds for those who could not pay the fees and restoring sickly stray animals to health . Hamdard quotes him as telling his teachers : " If poor students are not allowed to sit for exams due to non-payment of fee , they will become terrorists . " <p> Mashal Khan sitting next to a public sculpture in Moscow in Pakistani attire <p> Walking in his father 's footsteps , he became associated with the Pakhtun Students Federation , an affiliate of the Pakhtun nationalist Awami National Party , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he was bookish , with a mind of his own and felt he was being used by politicians " . He " became alienated from his colleagues in the student federation because they thought they could exercise leadership with guns " . <p> Mashal had the character of a moth that flew too close to the flame . He died because he morally and intellectually challenged those for whom his critical thinking shocked the very system that shaped their actions and beliefs , says Hamdard , the teacher he was close to . There was nothing wrong with Mashal himself , says his friend Najeeb , " it is just that our society has n't reached his level of rational thought or enlightenment yet " . <p> Many among us would nod knowingly at this . But in the year that Pakistan turned 70 , Mashal would be another witch thrown in the great fires of inquisition the Pakistani state has stoked since -- and even before -- Zia 's years of Islamic McCarthyism . Iqbal Khan was once dubbed a ' communist ' -- as was his son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with progressive movements . The mullahs , who received Eid greetings on the phone from General Ziaul Haq himself , would refuse to lead the funerals of ' communists ' among them in an eerie parallel to Mashal 's funeral . <p> Early in the year , the state took away some bloggers critical of the security forces and invoked blasphemy to silence them despite the explosive nature of the subject . It drove home the point , for many , that Pakistan really is doomed to stay anchored to Zia 's vision forever ; regardless of the optimism brought on by quiet fleeting interludes that suggest a transition for the better . Mashal 's lynching provided the terrifying spectacle the state needed to put fear in the hearts of those critical of its policies . It also proved in no uncertain terms that when it comes to enlightenment , it is one step forward and ten steps backwards into darkness for Pakistan . <p> " Our states , being ourselves multiplied , are what we are ; they write our natures in bolder type , and do our good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historian-philosophers Ariel and Will Durant . It follows , then , that a state fashioned after a society 's nature would endorse and reinforce that very nature . " What the state advocates manifests itself in individuals , " says Dr Faizullah Jan , a teacher of journalism at the University of Peshawar who has authored a book titled The Muslim Extremist Discourse . <p> In 2017 , the state invited a mob to pile up a pyre and sent it out to look for witches to burn at the stake . As is often the case with the vengeful using blasphemy as a tool to trigger blind , feral mob sentiments , the AWKUM administration latched on to an instrument that the state itself employed and endorsed vocally to silence political dissent . Mashal 's murder was waiting to happen , as was that of the man shot dead by three sisters in Sialkot because he had allegedly blasphemed years ago . If his lynching shocked , it was because one did not expect the wild pageant of brutal murder to play out in a university , an institution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his brother , doing homework at home <p> Yet , in a year when young militants were traced back , yet again , to universities , this should not have been a surprise . The debate about highly-educated cohorts of Al-Qaeda , Jamaat-e-Islami , Jamaat-ul-Ahrar and the Islamic State operating at multiple levels is as old as the history of terrorism and violence by these very organisations . A radicalising school curriculum and religious groups cottoning on to the identity crisis of the middle class , bringing violent ideologues to universities -- where , according to Jan , youth treat a radical outlook as a " badge of honour and identity " -- may be at the heart of the problem . <p> But , like other state institutions , a university seeks direction from power centres like the parliament , the establishment , the judiciary and the media . The message AWKUM got -- from the security establishment , the interior ministry and the Islamabad High Court -- was clear and unanimously reinforced : give a dog a bad name and hang it . <p> As his friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debate to reform society . He was at home in what Jan calls " the free market of ideas where people decide for themselves what is right or wrong " . But in a place where a progressive outlook is equated with atheism , anyone with Mashal 's world view could be perceived as a counterpoint to the narrative of intolerance and neo-liberal imperialist ambition . This threat , says Jan , translates into an ongoing struggle between two opposing forces that have divided society into ' us ' and ' them ' . " It is all black and white now , with nuances ignored . These ( mutually opposing ) forces see the ' other ' as a negation of themselves -- a threatening ' other ' that must be crushed , " the professor adds . <p> Mashal stood in between these two warring forces -- as Aristotle 's Golden Mean -- who neither subscribed to the extremists ' view ( because he was a Sufi ) nor endorsed the western imperialist designs ( since he had read Marx ) . " Anyone in Pakistan , indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represent the Golden Mean , " says Jan . <p> Mashal 's death , then , has come to underpin the Pakistani zeitgeist as another year passes us by . Who really represents the spirit of our times ? Is it Mashal or Khadim Hussain Rizvi ? The victim or the victor ? " It is really hard to tell when you are going through a moment ; you only can tell in retrospect , " says Zaigham Khan , a researcher and analyst based in Islamabad . " What is sure is that , in 2017 , the state delegated the monopoly over violence to the mob . " <p> In an increasingly polarised Pakistan , for many , Mashal Khan 's name is mud , kneaded out of volatile ingredients -- allegations of blasphemy and the hatred and violence it invokes . To others , he is the beacon of a better tomorrow , as his name suggests , illuminating a dark narrative of intolerance and misuse of faith to show it for what it is -- a weapon of oppression and domination . <p> The words he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpretation either way : " I live because the tower fell .

@@51610238 <p> The World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) says trade can shrink by 13-32 per cent . About $100 billion worth of foreign investment has already fled the emerging markets . Flows of remittances into the developing countries are also expected to decelerate as joblessness grows in most host countries . In the United States alone , 17 million jobs have been lost since mid-March . " Waves of job losses among overseas workers and international border closures are sapping the $690bn annual flow of global remittances , " warned a Bloomberg report last week . <p> These are very tough times -- tougher indeed for countries like Pakistan that were struggling with foreign exchange inflows even before the Covid-19 outbreak . <p> The slowdown in remittances began in Pakistan months before China reported the first case of the novel coronavirus in December last year . Back in August 2019 , the monthly inflow of remittances had slumped to $1.7bn from $2bn in August 2018 . <p> A declining trend in the inflows from key host countries is beyond doubt <p> Since then , growth in remittances has moderated chiefly owing to economic issues of , and job market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from where we receive 23pc and 20.7pc of total remittances , respectively . In the first eight months of this fiscal year , remittances grew just 5.4pc against 10.4pc a year ago . <p> A colossal loss in oil revenues is eclipsing growth prospects of Saudi Arabia , United Arab Emirates and other four GCC nations . The Covid-19 -- triggered stimuli and support packages offered by their governments are going to upset their fiscal projections . And this happens as lockdowns and social distancing aimed at fighting the pandemic are accelerating the economic meltdown in the GCC region and elsewhere . The economic downturn in the United States and the United Kingdom is also in sight as both economies are worst hit by Covid-19 . The decline in global trade threatens their export earnings as well . <p> Lots of unskilled or semi-skilled Pakistani workers in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are losing jobs . Average earnings of all others , including professionals and managers , are also bound to fall in the near future . Thousands of overseas Pakistanis in these two countries had returned home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just waiting for the easing of lockdown restrictions to follow suit . <p> The condition of Pakistani workers in other four GCC countries -- i.e. Bahrain , Kuwait , Oman and Qatar -- is no different . Another problem with them is they rely primarily on corporate jobs . Very few of them have partnered with locals to run businesses or have any additional source of income . Pakistanis living in these countries would likely reduce monthly remittances back home earlier than those in Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates . <p> Pakistanis employed in the United States and United Kingdom , too , have started feeling the pinch of the Covid-19 -- driven wave of joblessness . Naturally , their average monthly remittances might also fall . <p> So a declining trend in the flow of future remittances from key host countries seems almost certain . Unfortunately , under the current situation that decline can not be compensated from elsewhere . Covid-19 has devastated Spain and Italy . We can hardly expect anything close to the pre-pandemic level of remittances from there . <p> The same seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Germany , Canada , Australia and even Malaysia . In fact , remittances from Malaysia are vulnerable to a steeper decline as lots of Pakistanis there were supplementing their incomes from small businesses set up with the help of Malaysians . Such businesses , mostly established in the informal sector , could hardly be revived anytime soon . <p> One thing is sure then : just like other economic indicators , remittances will remain a headache not only during this fiscal year , but also afterwards . Even in the best case , the IMF is expecting a " partial recovery " of the global economy next year . <p> Bureau of Emigration and Overseas Employment Director General Kashif Ahmed Noor estimates that remittances in 2019-20 can fall by $1bn to $1.5bn . <p> The loss in remittances means a lot for Pakistan as it can worsen external-sector problems . The government is trying to boost exports , but that is not so easy amid a global slowdown . Whether an earlier uptick in FDI will continue under the changed circumstances is uncertain . And foreign investment in high-yielding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $2.35bn funds parked in treasury bills have been divested so far this fiscal year . <p> The future pace of remittances depends a lot on whether the PTI government succeeds in convincing the GCC leaders to consider ensuring some level of job safety for Pakistani workers , particularly in unskilled and semi-skilled categories . <p> Much also depends on how soon the spread of Covid-19 is contained , lockdowns are eased and talented Pakistani youngsters are mass-trained in occupations and skills that will be most needed in the post-pandemic world . But that 's a medium-term thing . <p> In the short run , two things can help stave off a freefall of remittances . One , tighter controls on hundi/havala and , two , more incentives for remitters . In the recent past , remittances ' inflows through illegal channels have thinned but not disappeared . Some incentives can lure remitters to use banking channels . <p> For example , an exemption from service charges currently applicable on transactions of $500 or more can be extended to lower volumes .

Bacon-egg-and-cheese sandwich from the cart outside the office for breakfast ? Do n't mind if I do . A quick road trip to see your grandma upstate ? She 'll be so happy to see us ! Getting together with friends for a basketball game in the park or a few drinks in a bar ? Why the hell not ? <p> And then came the coronavirus .

This is called " moral fatigue , " and it 's exhausting . <p> As a culture that was all but burned out before the coronavirus pandemic hit , the past few weeks of seismic societal shifts have made us readjust in ways most of us never imagined .

As the death toll rises , and reports of increasing numbers of younger people being hospitalized surface , we 're finally starting to understand how serious this pandemic is , and the impact each one of us can have on the outcomes -- whether or not we realize it . <p> In most of our everyday lives , this comes into play when we 're making what used to be routine decisions . Let 's take the example of going to the grocery store . A few weeks ago , you probably would have made the trip without a second thought . But it 's no longer that simple . If you leave your home to go to the supermarket -- a public place where everyone is touching everything from food to carts to money -- it could put you in contact with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something you touch . Of course , there 's the concern over whether you 'll get infected , but beyond that , we now have to consider whether we could then unknowingly pass the virus on to someone else at the store , on the bus , or in our own homes , and then whether that person will pass it along to others , and so on , and so on . <p> " We are now , in many ways , thinking about things that we would n't have previously reflected on , " Dr. Michael Baur , associate professor of philosophy at Fordham University , who specializes in natural law and moral philosophy , tells Rolling Stone . " The chain of causality has always been there , but now it has become important for us to be more reflective about the multiple layers of complex causality and the real scope of our decision-making . " <p> As much as we 'd like to believe that we 're all lone wolves who can fend for ourselves and prioritize our own best interests , in reality , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiction to think that we 're not already deeply connected to one another -- we always have been , " Baur explains .

" <p> And that is where moral fatigue comes in . Now that many routine aspects of our lives involve high-stakes decision-making , it 's a lot for our brains to process . According to Baur , this is because we usually allow ourselves to be lazy and oblivious to our interdependence , taking it for granted . " We 're now forced to be aware of it , " he says . " Now , small types of interaction can have severe consequences . It requires an added level of mental effort , carefulness and reflectiveness .

" It has actually led to people isolating even more than the quarantine requires . Instead of deciding to go through the drive-through or order in delivery for lunch , they choose to just eat what 's in the pantry . " <p> Similarly , Dr. Adam L. Fried , a professor of psychology at Midwestern University and a clinical psychologist with a private practice , has noticed that the overall stress of the coronavirus outbreak has taken a toll on many of his patients -- on top of having to deal with moral fatigue . " For many , there seems to be more at stake in terms of these everyday decisions , both for ourselves , our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rolling Stone . " Many of us are n't accustomed to having to consider severe possible consequences resulting from normally mundane errands and tasks . " <p> Of course , the moral fatigue is taxing in itself , but we also have to keep in mind that making any type of difficult or ethically complex decision is stressful , even under the best circumstances . In other words , it 's not only the frequency at which we 're now making tough choices -- the decision-making process itself can be mentally and emotionally exhausting when there is not a clear choice . " We know from research with professionals , such as health care workers , that having to make difficult ethical decisions , in which there may not be a clear ' right answer , ' can be highly stressful and take an emotional toll on people , " Fried explains . " These can include feeling emotionally exhausted , increased feelings of self-doubt and burnout . " <p> Making these types of decisions feels like a " no win " situation : No matter what you decide , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle to come up with the best answer , knowing that there may be no 100-percent ' correct ' one , can leave many feeling frustrated and exhausted , " Fried says . " This is coupled with the anxiety associated with not knowing if things will worsen and not knowing when this situation will end . " <p> Until some sort of end is in sight , there are ways to help cope with moral fatigue and the stress of these higher-stakes decisions . First , Fried says that he encourages patients to recognize and acknowledge that we are in a truly unprecedented situation and that these decisions are tough . " Talking with supportive friends and family can be really helpful in terms of processing feelings , normalizing fears and doubts and talking through decision-making , " he adds . Metzger advises her patients not to overwhelm themselves with too many decisions at once . " Break it up into one day at a time , " she says . " Anxiety has a way of making everything feel urgent . " <p> And as exhausting as moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're taking the time to reflect more on how our decisions and actions may affect other people . Of course , situations like the one we 're in now can also have the opposite effect , Baur says , causing people to become more selfish and self-protective . But for now , it can help to focus on the potential good that can come from this shift in public mindset . " This is a sort of wake up call for all of us , " Baur says . " The added strain and effort , on the one hand , is unpleasant , and our lives are more complicated . But on the other hand , it 's potentially a very good thing , because the alternative is to live the usual oblivious life where we do n't recognize our interdependence . "

@@51640238 <h> Promoting excellence in advertising <p> How to communicate and respond to customers during the current pandemic . <p> Marketing professionals around the world are often fond of using fancy terms and jargon , but once in a while something happens that jolts us all out of our complacency . The current pandemic is definitely a perfect example of this . Marketing is generally not a proactive function but rather reactive to changes in consumer behaviour and economic conditions . <p> Coronavirus means it 's not business as usual . With the world literally at a standstill , how do brands navigate the crisis ? How do they decide what to do , what to say and most importantly how to say it ? Last week my boss sent me an informative PDF document and asked me to prepare a communication strategy for our company , Bogo . The PDF , by Carly Gibson ( Strategist ) and Renata Mittnacht ( Associate Director ) at Ogilvy New York , enumerates five steps that brands should follow in order to decide how to communicate and respond to their customers on social media during the current pandemic . These steps may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , people do n't default to common sense but to extremes or inaction or panic ( the writer does not recommend ceasing social media communication or going ' dark ' as they call it ) . <h> 1 . Listen <p> Brands that try to profiteer or sell will face adverse reactions . Each brand needs to get a pulse on the emotions of their audiences . Ten years ago we were told that the best part of social media was the fact that we can have a conversation with audiences ; yet , even today brands globally and locally struggle to listen to their audiences . Gibson and Mittnacht outline three trends : panic , solidarity and levity ( the need to laugh ) and to start off they recommend tracking hashtags related to coronavirus in the social media space , detailing how and with what emotions/reactions their brand is being talked about . <h> 2 . Be Sensitive <p> Brands often struggle finding the correct tone and voice to use on social media in normal times , and given the current cocktail of fear , panic , stress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The tone should be sensitive and this is definitely not the right time to push irrelevant products or over sell relevant ones . Gibson and Mittnacht provide a checklist to help brands avoid appearing as profiteers or unintentionally encouraging behaviours such as going out or touching one 's face , is the tone making light of a serious subject . <h> 3 . Be Transparent <p> Transparency is critical . Brands need to communicate openly and take on the feedback from their audiences . Brand managers and agency partners managing the social space need to learn how to respond to angry comments and provide customers with accurate information without appearing to be patronising or tone deaf . <h> 4 . Adapt <p> We all are familiar with the expression adapt or die . Simon Sinek ( the motivational speaker ) in a video talk spoke about the need to reinvent . Brands and companies need to reevaluate processes , thinking and very importantly , how they communicate , what they say and where they say it .

" Put simply , it 's time for brands to walk the talk . Many brands have decided to champion the stay at home message . Others have focused on trying to diffuse the panic and disseminating facts . Another area of opportunity is to collaborate with medical associations or health professionals . A third area is new products and offerings that are relevant at present . <p> Every brand needs to soul search and decide what role it can play and how it can still be of value to its customers as well as perform the best and most responsible marketing in the time of coronavirus.

@@51693236 <h> Email <p> NOOR Jahan , Mughal emperor Jahangir 's wife , loved Lahore and in one of her Persian couplets has passionately expressed her endearment : <p> This can roughly be translated as : <p> I have bought Lahore by paying for it with my life , I have given away life and have bought another kind of paradise ! <p> True to her words , she died in Lahore and was buried in the paradise she bought so dearly . <p> What kind of charm does Lahore have that bewitches everyone even today ? Is it the intellectual atmosphere , the literary aura , the historical buildings , the gardens , the centuries-old traditions ? Is it its people or the cultural ambience ? Perhaps all these put together create a magical effect that can steal one 's heart . But Noor Jahan was not alone to be mesmerised by Lahore 's lethal charms and there have been others too who in latter times sang of Lahore passionately . <p> One such lover of Lahore was Kanhaiya Lal Hindi . In his book Tareekh-i-Lahore , or the history of Lahore , Kanhaiya Lal has not only recorded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his dismay over the calamities that had befallen on Lahore in different eras of its history . Tareekh-i-Lahore was first published in 1884 and since then has been reproduced many times by different publishers . An edition published by Lahore 's Majlis-i-Taraqqi-i-Adab ( MTA ) has an added value because of the preface that Kalb-e-Ali Khan Faiq wrote . The MTA has recently reprinted Tareekh-i-Lahore with a fresh mechanical calligraphy . <p> The book has four parts and each is subdivided in to different portions according to topics . The first part narrates who inhabited Lahore in which era and what historical events took place . In this portion he tells about 13 great tragedies that befell on Lahore in different eras . It also gives details about the 12 historic gates that Lahore has . Then he gives the accounts of Lahore 's printing presses , calligraphers , scholars , prostitutes , poets , hakeems ( physicians that practised traditional medicine ) and other professionals . <p> The second part describes different neighbourhoods in Lahore . The third one is about Lahore 's famous and old houses , mosques @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourth part presents Lahore 's large houses and the details this portion gives sound more of an architectural natural than historical . <p> While describing the Mughal-era historical monuments and tombs of Lahore , he laments how they were ruined especially during the Sikh reign when precious stones and marble carvings were removed and were either sold or used in building some Sikh monuments . Many old buildings were stolen brick by brick and people used them in constructing their own houses . Many gardens either totally disappeared were simply encroached upon bit by bit , including Shalimar Gardens . <p> The preface by Kalb-e-Ali Khan Faiq proffers important information about the book as well as its author . According to Faiq , Kanhaiya Lal was born in June 1830 in the town of Jaisalmer into a Kayasth Mathur family . He learnt Urdu , Persian and English and composed poetry in Urdu and Persian , taking ' Hindi ' as penname . Kanhaiya Lal Hindi obtained a degree in engineering from Roorkee Engineering College and in June 1850 was posted as Assistant Engineer at Lahore . Here he rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services in 1885 . He also took part in some construction works of some buildings in Lahore that now have historic value , such as Government College building and Montgomery Hall . <p> Entrusted with the repair works of Lahore 's historical buildings , he developed a taste for history . Settled in Lahore , his liking for Punjab and Lahore turned into a lifelong love affair and he wrote a book in Urdu on Punjab 's history . Published in 1876 , it was titled Tareekh-i-Punjab and became popular . Then he wrote Lahore 's history and named it Tareekh-i-Lahore . In this book , as put by Faiq , Kanhaiya Lal seems to be an unbiased historian and while describing the Muslim-era buildings and gardens in a sympathetic way he laments the ruination of these buildings and mosques . <p> Kanhaiya Lal 's poetical Persian works include Gulzar-i-Hindi , Bandagi Nama and Yadgar-i-Hindi . He translated Punjabi 's famous folklore ' Heer Ranjha ' into versified Persian and named it Nigareen Nama . Ranjeet Nama , also known as Zafar Nama , is his Persian work on Maharaja @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Urdu poetical work is Munajat-i-Hindi , says Faiq . As mention in Nuqoosh ( Lahore Number ) , Kanhaiya Lal Hindi died in Lahore on February 23 , 1888 . <p> Tareekh-i-Lahore is a fascinating read for those with interest in history or Lahore or both . A detailed list of contents makes it easy for the reader to find the subdivisions of different parts . One has a feeling that the giant-sized special issue on Lahore published by Nuqoosh and named Lahore Number might have been inspired by this book . At least it must have served as a guideline for that monumental issue of Nuqoosh that is a treasure-trove of cultural and literary history of Lahore and has become a part of Lahore 's

Whether it was negotiations with the government or the political jirga , the media reported on the two parallel shows , and they were given equal weight . If there were any possibilities of a political settlement between the government and the PTI , the shrieking distortions introduced by PAT ensured that they would not mature . <p> It is hard to understand the eagerness of our media to treat a rabble-rouser from Canada with loyal but limited supporters at par with a robust political party with national support and a sizeable representation in the parliament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the politically aware PTI supporters were from the supporters of Qadri hankering after pieces of tissue papers laden with his sweat . <p> Though the PTI leadership is quite self-sufficient in damaging the party 's cause , Qadri has done more damage to it than they realize .

But then PTI has collected its share of electables and that is how they are expected to think . <p> Now that Qadri has decided to end his parallel dharna at Islamabad , what does it mean for the PTI ?

@@51772236 <h> If you are the US , you can get away with anything . Even torture . <p> A Guantanamo detainee 's feet are shackled to the floor at Camp 6 detention center , at the US Naval Base , in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba . <p> States exist for their own well-being . They have their self-interests . Domestic and foreign policies define and dictate state acts and omissions on the world stage . In the post 9/11 order , state-to-state interaction has undergone an incredible amount of change with the entire gamut of international relations now at the mercy of a few role players . The United States of America , of course , holds the centre stage , in a global effort against the spread of religious fanaticism and waging a war on terrorism . <p> That being said , the recently released report detailing the US Central Intelligence Agency 's ( CIA ) tactics of interrogation after September 11 , 2001 , has rocked the Washington political scene . The reaction has been one of shock and awe . Tremors have been felt far and beyond US boundaries with mixed feelings expressed by American allies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culmination of the Senate Intelligence Committee 's five-year effort of reading and analysing more than 6.3 million pages of CIA documents to assess the CIA 's use of " enhanced interrogation techniques " in the post-9/11 era . That review produced a more than 6,000 page review that was condensed into a 525-page summary which the committee released on December 9th . This delivered a brutal assessment of the CIA 's practices . <p> The release of the report took six long years of haggling between the CIA and the White House . A lot of back and forth took place essentially about managing the dissemination of information . Those six years were spent on walking a tight rope and trying to contemplate on either exposing too many or too few details to the general public . The end product , as we see it , has been blanked out at several places so that national security interests are not jeopardised . It mentions a series of events , torture strategies , sessions and investigations carried out by officials , providing a graphic description of how detainees were treated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the report . We all know that whatever has been disclosed is a ' bunch of crap ' not in the sense that Dick Cheney described it , but it is literally filled with gross and nasty , inhumane stories of lives and bodies of people being played around with and mutilated , both emotionally and physically . Pages after pages are filled with narration of complete violation of human dignity and values that are critical for the existence and survival of a civilised society . <p> Other than Cheney 's outrageous response , the report has n't been received favourably . Yes , there are some like Sam Harris who feel that torture is a legitimate weapon and hence can be liberally employed to extract information . Obviously , Harris has his own set of ideas and arguments to support his contention , which , to my mind , are based on the good old , Machiavellian , fear tactics used effectively by John Ashcroft and company . They have undoubtedly worked at the expense of taking away trust and tolerance from different pockets of the American society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has come out from the shadows to defend the torture methods as well . Hayden was an important part of anti-terrorism strategy during the George Bush White House years . Additionally , right wingers like Rush Limbaugh , are having a field day , trying to punch down the report 's credentials left , right and centre in an effort to prove that a no torture policy is not acceptable . <p> Current CIA Director , John Brennan , addressed the Senate torture report in a live press conference on Thursday , December 11th . He defended his agency , saying that after 9/11 , those involved operated with national security in mind , but admitted , <p> " The CIA was unprepared to conduct a detention and interrogation program , and our officers inadequately developed and monitored its initial activities . " <p> The one sanest voice that came across was that of Dianne Feinstein , chairperson of the Senate Intelligence Committee . The senator from the state of California declared that the torture tactics were ' a stain on our values and our history ' . Ms Feinstein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McCain , a republican from Arizona . McCain , a torture victim during the Vietnam War himself , vehemently criticised the use of blatant procedures and believes that torturing detainees will only be detrimental to US efforts to stem the growth of religious fundamentalism . <p> For countries like Pakistan , that have been at the forefront of the war on terrorism , the report is a reconfirmation of the fact that Pakistani nationals , handed over to the US over time , were mishandled in the worst possible ways . While the government has always faced stiff public opposition , pressure and questions regarding the support are bound to increase . Apparently , the US has now come up with an explanation to calm the Pakistani emotions down by assuring the government that it will not indulge in nefarious tactics on detainees that violate international humanitarian precepts . Needless to say , such assurances can be nothing but hollow promises . <p> Nations like Pakistan before handing over their citizens , must do some homework rather than blindly putting their own people at risk . This is something for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has proven to be the breeding ground of terrorism , yet , it appears that investigation processes lack clarity , and better vetting should be done prior to branding anyone a ' terrorist ' . <p> The CIA report is bound to bring to light other policies pursued by the US . Use of drones has been questioned in the past . Such questions are being discussed even more actively now . Is the usage of drones to target terrorist hideouts even working or is it only adding to the list of problems and enemies for the US ? The fact that drone attacks in various parts of the world , such as Afghanistan and Northern Pakistan , have ended up killing thousands of innocent civilians only means that more and more victims now want to seek revenge . Families , clans and , in some cases , entire villages have been rendered dysfunctional by the dreadful drones . <p> Now that the cat is out of the bag , the CIA report has shed doubts about America 's commitment toward democracy and democratic values . While the US touts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proven itself to be one of the worst aggressors in world history . It is a setback for those who had abundant faith in the spirit of liberty that this country stood for . Hard working , peace-loving immigrants come here seeking livelihood , peaceful coexistence and freedom from want and persecution . At the global level , anti-US forces have pounced on the opportunity to criticise Washington and condemn its double standards . The CIA report is nothing but a stigma , a scar that is almost impossible to get rid of . <p> Since I 'm at it , I 'd be missing out on an opportunity to reflect on something that has nagged me for a while . And , this is the TV show ' Homeland ' -- a sad , pathetic and distorted portrayal of facts . No one expects Hollywood dramas to be perfect but ' Homeland ' is one hell of nonsense that tests the patience of even the most tolerant and less-sceptical minds . Unlike what the show depicts , CIA , as the report in question proves beyond doubt , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrap the show and come up with something that is closer to reality . <p> All things considered , this CIA report is no flash in the pan or a social media gimmick making rounds of the freaky internet . It is not an account of a one off , coincidental occurrence that took place , and hence we roll with it and let it go . <p> Torture is an institution in the US . <p> The report shows that CIA and torture are close like salt and pepper . This is about real life and the real destruction of it . Worst of all , as the document makes it clear , the irony of all this is that the results of all the torture inflicted on the detainees did not even produce the desired results . <p> Even worse , the US has lost the high moral ground that it occupied not long ago . The bare-knuckle approach did not go down well . That good guy , friend of humanity image has been chopped into pieces , disintegrated into the ground . All we are now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totting , bomb dropping , image that 'll not help make any friends at a time when the US is in terrible need of friends . <p> Getting the report out does n't necessarily change the ground reality that the US has acted as an international bully . Washington needs to do a tremendous amount of damage control . Current US policies do not auger well for the future generations , not only domestically but they have a negative universal impact . It is , however , a matter of appreciation that unlike many other countries of the world where brutalities carried out on enemies are never disclosed , the US has a transparent system , enough to acknowledge its blunders and blemishes . <p> Now that we are done with the process of identification and acknowledgement , this is the time to start making amends . The root to the fruit , as they say , is to rediscover the sense and spirit to do well , act smartly , and persevere and pursue policies that are humane and just . Over-ambitiousness will no longer work if the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nations . <p> On a personal note , this writer still has hope . <p> Yes , I felt a sense of betrayal last week when the report came out . Yet , I believe that the US lost its way momentarily and will be back on track if thorough steps and measures are taken . <p> Having spent the best years of my life here , I know that this country is all about justice , fairness , equality and strong values . I can attest to the fact that there are an incredible number of good folks here that do good and encourage others to do the same . Yes , Washington is a nasty place but politicians and policy makers know and understand that this torture episode has pushed the societal consciousness to its limits . There 's no more stretching or flexing of muscles . It is time to contemplate and let peaceful tenets and beliefs overpower the obsession to hurt and kill . <p> The CIA report is a hyper distortion of the ideals and values that the US stands for . No matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tortures , the fact remains that the US is capable of conducting business in a much better , effective , tactful and respectable manner . Cooler heads need to prevail . There 's no other better way to fix the systemic aberrations.

So far , Modi and his jingoist RSS /BJP fanatics are shell-shocked and thoroughly embarrassed as their saffron brand Nazi Hindutva has been given a bloody nose by the Chinese without firing a single shot .

For more than a decade , a rising China and re-emerging Russia remained America 's main security and economic concern that led to execution of USA 's Indo-Pacific Rebalancing Policy , bringing in to play the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue ( QSD , also known as the Quad ) ; which is an informal strategic forum between the United States , Japan , Australia and India , maintained by semi-regular summits , information exchanges and military drills between member countries . Moreover , the US ' red-faced withdrawal from Afghanistan without achievement of its declared and undeclared strategic objectives necessitated the need for a regional aspirant hegemon who could checkmate China as well as take good care of nuclear Pakistan . Thus , India was brought into the great game by declaring her the new US strategic ally in the region . However , China showed strategic patience to Indian immature overtures and responded to American Indo-Pacific Rebalancing by " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response demonstrating Chinese intentions in the Indian Ocean region and in South China Sea . It refers to the network of Chinese military and commercial facilities and relationships along its sea lines of communication , which extend from the Chinese mainland to Port Sudan in the Horn of Africa . As for Chinese domination of land lines of communication and global trade , China went head over heels for the execution of Belt and Road Initiative ( BRI ) , incorporating 64 countries with USD1.3 trillion in Chinese investment . <p> On the other hand , to prove equal to the task as US ' strategic ally , India found it convenient to incorporate her RSS/BJP agenda of turning India into Hindutva led Maha Barat , got emboldened but blinded by self-haughtiness . Modi quickly abrogated article 370 and 35 A of the Indian constitution , changed the status of Kashmir and Ladakh , went on quick pace to change the demography of Kashmir by allowing illegal domicile of Kashmir to Indian Hindu National , introduced the Citizenship Amendment Act depriving Muslims immigrants of Indian nationality , heightened escalations along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muslims all over India . Then came the belligerent Indian claims to take over GB and Azad Kashmir as announced on 03 May 2020 , Indian 's repeated attempt at stopping the Bhasha Dam construction , which is a CPEC project and claims that the CPEC route passes through disputed territory . <p> What became an immediate reason for Chinese action in Ladakh was development of new infrastructure at small town called Daulat Beg , where India had developed a brigade size military base with military landing strip , only 8 miles from the Karakoram Pass and construction of road Darbuk-Shyok-Daulat Beg in October last year , which became last straw on the camel back . After moving into Galwan Valley , China 's foreign ministry spokesperson said , " India must not misjudge the current situation or underestimate China 's firm will to safeguard its territorial sovereignty " in the Valley . The area is strategically crucial as it overlooks India 's Darbuk-Shyok-Daulat Beg Oldi ( DSDBO ) road , which connects Leh to Karakoram Pass .

Nevertheless , China 's state state-owned ' Global Times ' warned India recently to give up " misjudgments " and " misperceptions " about their northern neighbour and said Beijing had " the ability and wisdom to safeguard every inch of its land . " <p> While India is still licking its minor wounds , embedded Indians in western print and electronic media , who had spent three decades falsely projecting India as a potential global power and an existing regional sheriff , are now sheepishly spreading fresh narratives of ' China losing India to America ' , ' America not doing enough for India ' , and ' Russia as a time tested ally ' etc . Needless to mention that post-1990s , the two countries have focused on economic cooperation with bilateral trade going up to $92 billion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last month , the Modi government put curbs on Chinese investments , a step Beijing called " discriminatory " . India 's support for Tibet and its growing defence and security ties with the US , Japan and Australia have resulted in further suspicion from Beijing . <p> As for Pakistan , the Chinese move came as a blessing in disguise as it unquestionably proves the point that Kashmir is an international unsettled dispute as per UN resolutions , Ladakh is a part of Kashmir and thus regionally it is a tri-lateral issue among Pakistan , India and China ; all three being nuclear powers and thus this flashpoint has to be addressed on priority by the UN Security Council . India will now have to think many times before any false-flag or stage-managed operation along the LoC or elsewhere as it will provide Pakistan justification for executing a response more aggressive and meaningful than the Kargil offensive and that too in sync with our time-tested friend , China , which shall settle the Kashmir dispute once and for all . <p> Above all , the current situation will surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valley of Kashmir , but other movements of independence in India , especially in the North East seven sister states , Khalistan , forcefully annexed Junagadh and Hyderabad states . <p> Modi , BJP and its saffronised military junta will have to pay a politico-military price for getting their country humiliated . While India is at a loss on the failure of the Indo-Pacific policy , she will continue to run around to leverage Quad as well as the old Russian connections . China is least likely to budge on its territorial gains and claims . It goes without saying that China has taken only one solid step in Ladakh that is bound to permanently remove the threat to Karakoram Pass , Gilgit-Baltistan , KKH/CPEC land route and gives room to the Pakistan military to manoeuvre to link up to overcome the **31;2488;TOOLONG unfinished agenda and finally help in the resolution of the lingering Kashmir issue preferably as per UN resolutions or by military means .

@@51783235 <h> What deal of the century ? <p> At the start of the coming week , on July 1 , 2020 , President Trump 's " deal of the century " , relating to Israel 's annexation of the settlements in the West Bank and Gaza , is scheduled to take effect . This deal , announced by President Trump in January 2020 , is an uncloaked leap towards realising the Zionist dream of ' greater Israel ' in the heart of the Middle East . Masqueraded as a plan that will ensure that " Israel will get the security it needs ; Palestinians will get the State they crave " , this deal , in essence , belies the promises of freedom made to the Palestinian people , and rolls back the clock on decades of American diplomacy . <p> Let us put this in perspective . <p> Jerusalem ( read : Israel ) has been at the heart of Abrahamic religions , since the dawn of history in holy scriptures . All divine Abrahamic books -- the Torah , the Bible , and the Quran -- have references concerning Jerusalem and the children of Israel ( though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and only talks about it in reference to its surroundings and people ) . Numerous wars have been fought over Jerusalem . Countless people have died in pursuit of Jerusalem . And Jerusalem features in all apocalyptic prophecies of monotheistic faiths . The people of Moses ( A.S. ) were ' promised ' Jerusalem . Jesus ( A.S. ) was crucified in Jerusalem . And our Prophet Muhammad ( SAWW ) was carried to Jerusalem on a night ( described in Surah Bani Israel ) , and from there ascended to Heaven . <p> Consequently , for more than 4 billion people today -- those who prescribe to some form of Abrahamic tradition -- Jerusalem and Israel continue to occupy a central place in faith , history , and prophecy . <p> Islam 's transaction with Jerusalem started almost immediately after establishment of a Muslim State in Medina . In fact , as far back as 636 A.D. , the Rashidun Caliphate , under the command of Hazrat Umar ( R.A. ) laid siege to the city of Jerusalem ( which was under the command of Patriarch Sophronius of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A.D. , the Byzantine surrendered to the Muslims , establishing Islam 's control over the city of Jerusalem and the land of Palestine . <p> This Muslim control over the territory that is Israel today would not be challenged for almost 450 years -- till the First Crusade in 1099 , when Roman Catholic Crusaders from Europe conquered Jerusalem , killing ( almost all ) Muslim and Jewish residents of the Promised Land . <p> Christians ruled over this land for less than a hundred years ; in 1187 , the mythic Salah-ud-Din Ayyubi laid siege to Jerusalem , forcing Balian of Ibelin to surrender the city to Muslim conquerors . Importantly , no blood was shed during this conquest , as all Jewish and Christian residents were granted amnesty or safe passage by the Muslim ruler . And thus started Islam 's almost 800-year-long control of this area , under different dynasties from time to time . And with it , the name of Salah-ud-Din ( read : Saladin ) was etched in the Judeo-Christian memory forever . <p> Fast-forward to the modern age ; specifically , defeat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Israel , after WWII , in 1948 . <p> The modern arrangement , through which most of the present-day Middle-Eastern States were carved , was done at the arbitrary whims of West Allied powers -- victors of the two World Wars . Emaciated Muslim States , with tainted rulers , grappled to come to terms with the new world order ; feeble attempts were made to reclaim Jerusalem -- but all in vain . And the people of this area were forced to flee their land , finding abode in foreign territories and refugee camps , while dreaming to return to the olive trees of modern-day Israel . This apartheid gave way to Arab-Isaeli wars , and repeated intifadas by Palestinian youth , best captured in images of young Palestinian children throwing stones at Israeli Armoured Vehicles . <p> Throughout this agonising period , despite pressure from successive US administrations , the international community has never fully recognised Israel 's claim over the entire city of Jerusalem and its surrounding areas . Israel took control of West Jerusalem almost immediately after creation of the State , in 1948 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1967 , and annexed the eastern portion of the city in 1980 -- a move that remains unrecognised by most of the international community . And in recognition of the volatile nature of this issue , and in deference to international law as well as repeated UN Resolutions endorsing the same , no country ( of note ) has recognised Jerusalem as the capital of Israel . That is , until Trump . <p> In 2017 , the Trump administration announced its plans for initiating the process of shifting Israel 's U.S. embassy to Jerusalem . Trump 's 2017 announcement was met with a resounding condemnation from the international community . However , the Muslim community -- including its 41-country military alliance -- remained largely impotent in causing any ripples of consequence . <p> Emboldened by a feeble response from the Muslim world , the Trump administration followed up with their announcement of this ( sham ) deal of the century at the start of this year . Except that , for reasons that can only be called divine intervention , the world has changed tectonically over the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weakest ( international ) position it has been since the Second World War . And consequently , the Muslim world is starting to distance itself from the Trump administration . It started with strong opposition to this deal , by Jordan . Followed thereafter by the UAE . Then Qatar . Then Syria . And Egypt . And now , suddenly , the Zionist hopes of taking the first step towards ' greater Israel ' seem to be teetering . Even within the Trump administration , there are those who have voiced their desire to scrap ( or at least delay ) the implementation of this deal . <p> Pakistan must play its part in resisting this monstrosity of annexation in Israel . It is moments like these that echo across the sands of history . And anyone caught silent or neutral , in the midst of exigency , for centuries to come .

However , marble factories located in industrial estates can remain operational throughout the 24 hours which is expected to increase supply and create additional jobs . <p> According to Arshad Iqbal with the establishment of the marble city , the number of laborers working in marble factories will potentially increase by three hundred per cent . <p> Arshad Iqbal further said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an industrial estate for several years but the previous governments had paid no heed to their requests . <p> According to senior journalist Amir Mohammad Khan Chagharzai with the establishment of a marble industrial estate in Buner , all factories would be required to build underground tanks to prevent marble sludge from flowing into rivers which would be beneficial for agriculture and aquatic life . <p> Currently , marble factories in the district direct contaminated water into streams which pollutes the water . <p> Chagharzai further said that with the establishment of a marble industrial estate marble factories will be exempt from load shedding as power supply for marble the estate will be arranged independently of the rest of the district . <p> " In the past , governments have announced the establishment of a marble industrial estate but no practical steps were taken after that .

@@51801233 <h> Millat Tractors : set to cultivate sales growth in FY21 <p> In addition to the obvious potential for the tractor industry in an under-penetrated agrarian country like Pakistan , FY2021 may see an acceleration in Millat Tractor 's sales on the back of changes in the agriculture and construction sector <p> How important is agriculture to Pakistan ? The sector contributes 18.5% to the country 's gross domestic product ( GDP ) and employs 38.5% of the national labour force . Even our state emblem is made up of four crops : jute , cotton , wheat , and tea . <p> Yet for a country that prides itself on its agricultural base , we do not have enough of the one machine one really needs : a tractor . <p> According to the Pakistan Economic Survey of 2019-2020 , there are only 634,000 tractors operating in Pakistan . This , however , is a significant increase from when there were only 35,700 tractors in 1975 , 157,300 tractors in 1985 , 252,000 tractors in 1994 , and 401,700 tractors in 2004 . <p> Granted , this is an improvement from the decades before , this still means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horsepower per hectare of cultivable land . Compare that to the required power of 1.4 horsepower per acre , meaning there is a shortfall of 0.5 horsepower per hectare . <p> Now , from July 2018 to March 2019 , the total tractors ' production in the country stood at 37,399 . Of that , a substantial 64% was produced by one company alone : Millat Tractors . <p> Millat has always had a bit of a headstart when it came to tractors . Started in 1964 in Lahore , it is the authorized manufacturer of the American Massey Ferguson tractor in Pakistan . The company was nationalized in 1972 , and made a part of the Pakistan Tractor Corporation ( PTC ) . <p> The PTC started an indigenisation programme in 1980 , and got Millat Tractors on board to set up engine assembly plants in Pakistan . To this day , that programme has been successful : the tractor industry has achieved 95% of localisation in production . <p> As a result , this has led to cheap tractors when compared to tractors around the world , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As has been previously locally reported , most farmers find it difficult to invest in a tractor given that the average size of their farm is quite small for the purchase of a tractor to make sense . In addition , rates on loans from banks have not been generous in previous years , thus deterring more farmers from owning their own tractor . <p> That is why analyst Yasin Muhammad Hanif at Darson Securities is a little more optimistic , in his note sent to clients on June 29 . <p> Farmers ' incomes are set to improve for three reasons . First , the government announced a Rs56.6 billion agriculture package . Importantly , this package would also include Rs2.5 billion subsidy on the sales tax on locally-manufactured tractors for a period of one year . <p> Second , the interest rate has been slashed by 625 basis points over the course of four months , from 13.25% in March to 7% in July . This will help in procuring loans . <p> Finally , there is an increase in the wheat support price to Rs1400 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rs1,365 per 40 kilograms . <p> All of this bodes well not just for the tractor industry , but specifically also for Millat Tractor , given its high market share . Because the penetration and production figures are so low , there is a strong opportunity for growth . Hanif predicts a five-year compounded annual growth rate of 11% for Millat 's volumes . <p> Though the majority of the focus is on agriculture , it is also important to note that tractors are very useful in the construction sector , especially for cement . In fact , between 20% to 30% of Millat 's sales come from this segment . <p> In the first nine months of fiscal year 2020 , cement dispatches had grown by an average of 4.2% year-on-year . However , sales severely declined in April and May of this year , due to lockdown . To prevent a total collapse , the government announced a relief package for the construction sector . <p> " We think the incentives will play well in reviving private sector consumption therefore demand for tractors would also increase , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investing early on in Hyundai Nishat Motors . The company currently has an 18% stake in Hyundai , with an investment of Rs1.3 billion . This could contribute Rs30.37 per share . <p> And so : even though 2020 may have low numbers for Millat , the coming years are expected to be positive . The company 's net profitability is set to rise Rs2500 million in 2021 , to Rs3000 million in 2022 , to Rs3500 million in 2023 . Similarly , its net sales are set to rise from Rs20,000 million in 2021 , to Rs27,000 million in 2022 , to roughly Rs35,000 million in 2023 . <p> Are there any upcoming risks ? Yes : there could be an increase in the general sales tax , or perhaps construction will not pick up as predicted . However , perhaps the most worrying factor could be out of everyone 's hands : the locust . <p> Locusts are now present in 46 districts out of Pakistan 's 131 districts . The United Nations ' Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) has estimated $2.5 billion worth of losses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If our crops collapse , then there is no need for tractors in the agriculture sector -- and by default , only the construction sector to save Millat .

@@51801239 <h> Hyperscape , Ubisoft gives Battle Royale a new twist <h> Share <p> It has been leaked galore this past week for Ubisoft . There have been several rumors about Ubisoft working on a Battle Royale , and finally , we get to see what Ubisoft 's futuristic take on a Battle Royale looks like . The game will be launching later this year and will definitely add more elements and polish the existing ones . This is Daily Pakistan Gaming 's first impression of the game . <p> Hyper Scape is an exciting alternative in the genre for players who want to be competitive while having fun . The Battle Royale genre is usually placed in a post-war or apocalyptic setting ; Hyper Scape moves away from this giving the players fast-paced action in a futuristic urban city based on the city of Paris . The world of Neo Arcadia made by Ubisoft is one of the most visually pleasing aspects of the game . It has a compelling storyline that revolves around a technology company Prisma Dimensions-which oversees a virtual world similar to OASIS in Ready Player One . <p> Hyper Scape shares several mechanics with other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job giving its own unique twist . The game features loot crates like other Battle Royale such as Call Of Duty Warzone but differentiates it from others by introducing a different weapon leveling system . Rather than finding better guns in loot crates , like COD or attachments like Apex legends , Hyper Scape allows you to upgrade your existing guns by collecting the same weapons and fusing them . This might give your particular weapon of choice additional ammo capacity or grant you greater damage . The game features miniguns , shotguns , snipers , rifles , projectile shooting launchers , and many more . <p> Ubisoft has introduced ' Hacks ' into the gameplay , and do n't worry , it 's nothing like the hacks you know . Hyper Scape introduces a new ability system that might remind you of Apex Legends but is different in every aspect . Rather than relying on a particular character with specific abilities , you can find them in the loot itself . Each of these abilities is called ' Hacks . ' The ' Hacks ' present in the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wall , mine , and our very own favorite the ball . Some of them are pretty self-explanatory . It seems that Ubisoft has borrowed a couple of ideas from Fortnite by introducing the wall . Like Fornite , you can use the wallhack to create a barrier between you and your opponents . Slam allows you to leap high in the sky and then slam back on the ground dealing damage to enemies around you . If you want to know the location of nearby opponents , you can use ' Reveal , ' which pings nearby enemies ' locations . The hack that really caught our attention was ' The Ball . ' And as many of you might have guessed , it literally transforms your champion into a ball . While in this shape , you can bounce of stuff , but here 's a little warning ; it 's amusing . These abilities change the gameplay entirely and add more depth and excitement to Hyper Scape . <p> Hyper Scape has a new death mechanic where each time a champion dies , they turn into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not interact with enemies nor use any weapons ; however , you scout for your squad , revealing your opponents ' location . Your teammates can revive you from specific respawn points that are randomly located on the map . A respawn point is also present over the body of dead champions . Hyper Scape has a new take on the circle getting smaller in Battle Royale games . Most Battle Royale games feature some type of gas or storm , but Hyper Scape has taken a very different approach . As the circle gets smaller , the parts outside the circle start to disintegrate ; building and walls slowly turn invisible to the point you can run through them , after which you start losing your health . This makes it way easier to reach the safe zone but also makes it easier for opponents to see you rushing towards safety . This packs a lot more action to an already exhilarating game . <p> When the circle finally reaches its final form , you are given two options either outlast your opponents like every other Battle Royale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You must be intrigued by the mention of ' The Crown ' ? Well , this is yet another unique mechanic of Hyper Scape . When the final circle closes , a crown will appear on the map . The crown will be visible to all remaining players , and if a squad manages to keep the crown for 45 seconds , it wins , but the catch is in those 45 seconds the player withholding it will become visible to all remaining squads . This changes game 's entire strategy , forcing players to use their skills and ' Hacks ' uniquely . <p> Ubisoft has announced that real-world viewers of the game will also have control over how each match pans out . Hyper Scape will have a twitch integration through which twitch viewers can vote for a specific in-game event to take place for a short time . A few of them are Low gravity and Reveal . This connects viewers to players in a way that has never been seen before . Combine that with exciting new mechanics and innovations , the Battle Royale genre seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to capture players ' attention like a fast-paced Battle Royale like Apex Legends . A huge fast-growing fan base can propel the game to the top of the genre 's food chain , but it 's easier said than done . All of this meant we strongly believe Ubisoft has created a brilliant game for casual gamers

@@51805240 <h> In search of a capital <p> Currently there is an ongoing search for the capital city of the new province of Southern Punjab . Multan seems to be the winner . After the infamous 18th Amendment while Islamabad has been cut to size , the position of the Chief Minister ( CM ) has become very important . While I fully support devolution of power if it is all the way down to the district , town and union council , it has stopped at the provincial level in this case . The race for the coveted position of CM has started amongst the political heavyweights of the area . Eyes are focused on the new capital . <p> As a country , we have suffered in this search for a capital as most aspirants have vested interests to impose personal rule . Ayub Khan was always uncomfortable with Karachi so he decided to move the seat of power near the GHQ and his own village on the other side of Margalla Mountains . He thought that his empire would rule the country from their home ground , but his heir apparent Captain ( R ) Gohar Ayub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his first visit to East Pakistan , could sense the ambition of the General to build his own capital so he personally superseded him . <p> Ambition for personal glory has to be contained before it gets out of hand . I am sure there must have been debate within the All India Muslim League on the selection of the new capital . Perhaps it was a close race between Lahore , Dhaka and Karachi . My folks who migrated from Ludhiana , East Punjab thought the city was too close to the border so they settled in Rawalpindi from where they had planned to return to their roots in Baramulla , Kashmir . Also , Lahore had too many imperial and colonial roots . Dhaka too had imperial roots and was densely populated though the Muslim League was born here in 1906 . Karachi , being a seaport and a cosmopolitan city , was a good compromise . Though the father of the nation was born here , he settled in Bombay where he practised law . The Jinnah House is now being contested for ownership , being the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also accepted the new capital as they were connected through water . Till today there is a huge Bengali population in Karachi . The shifting of the first capital started the process of the break-up of Quaid 's Pakistan . <p> Ayub Khan 's ambition and search for a capital for personal glory destroyed the country . The same process should not be repeated again . Politics of the federation and the provinces should be handled separately to reach an amicable outcome without pressure or leverage . New provinces are certainly needed for good governance . Punjab is too big a province to be managed from Lahore . India has been very successful at creating new provinces while we have been going back and forth . The debate should start in the Punjab Assembly to come up with the best way forward , the federation should not jump in at the initial stages . Federal players should focus on national issues and effectively run their ministries instead of building their own personal empires and capitals . The former state of Bahawalpur desires to be on its own instead of coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm-twisting or influence-peddling for personal advantage by using the state apparatus . <p> After the 1970 elections and break-up of Pakistan , the first CM of Punjab was Malik Meraj Khalid who was an MNA of Pakistan People 's Party ( PPP ) . Malik Sahib was a seasoned politician who ran the province well . Bhutto then separated the provincial and federal players . While Punjab was left with Ghulam Mustafa Khar and Hanif Ramay , Malik Sahib went to the centre . Today the country faces serious internal governance and external challenges . Kashmir and surrounding areas are bracing for a major conflict . While the Prime Minister has focus and is doing his best , the cabinet leaves a lot to be desired . In politics , there are always difficult choices . While Abraham Lincoln the great US President lost the election for the senate , he was elected President as his appeal and message was widespread and well understood . There is a famous English proverb , ' Running with the hare and hunting with the hound ' which applies here . Those who seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to be exposed for rational politics to return as it was in the decades of fifties and seventies . Political bounty hunters are no longer needed in the land of the pure . <p> The PM is closely monitoring the performance of his cabinet which is a good sign . A team can be effective if it has a cohesive approach called teamwork . As a successful cricket captain , Imran Khan always worked for the team , not individual goals . Javed Miandad often complained of aggressive declarations by the captain to win the match instead of letting him score centuries . He is now leading a more complex team with diverse players having hidden agendas , it is taking more time to reach logical conclusions but I am sure he will get there sooner or later . As the leader , he has to set the agenda of every player . Job descriptions have to be clearly defined for each role . There should be neither duplicity nor overlaps . The team working on creating new provinces should have a clear mandate to draw the lines and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to establish fiefdoms and dynasties . <p> In practical life , it is widely believed that there is no substitute to experience , similarly in politics there is no shortcut to struggle and service to the people . Back door entrants have dominated the political arena in the last about forty years thereby reducing the parliament into a debating club like the free speech corner in Hyde Park in London . Pakistan is not a park , it is a country of over 220 million real people who have needs that are not being met due to political jugglers who manage to cling on to power in every government despite a poor record of serving the people or effectively leading their ministries while in the federal government . The people of Southern Punjab should decide on the division of their area including the selection of capital/capitals by following the due constitutional process without the manipulation of the political sharks .

The Alternative Energy Policy 2006 tried to make up for the loss but without much success . <p> Politics around the energy sector once again pushed Pakistan to an era of load-shedding in the late 2000s . The cost of load-shedding jumped , both at the societal and economic levels , at the beginning of the second decade of 21st Century . <p> In 2013 , the supply of electricity stood at 14,835 megawatts against demand for 20,695MW . The annual cost was estimated at $4-5 billion on the economic front ( Vision 2025 ) . <p> The social cost was hidden as there was no mechanism in Pakistan to measure the psychological impact and its relevance for mental health . <p> Pakistan had no resources to combat the challenge and no country was ready to invest in this country due to terrorism . Pakistan was scrambling to find investment to overcome power blackouts . <p> Coming to rescue <p> In this situation , China put trust in Pakistan and began to invest in the energy sector . It took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times . <p> In the meantime , many Chinese workers were targeted and some of them were killed . For private companies , it was risky to put resources in a terrorism-hit country , but Beijing and its companies continued to support Pakistan and introduced the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ) . <p> CPEC 's investment not only helped to manage load-shedding but it also contributed to job creation . It created about 23,000 jobs in different phases , especially in the most backward areas of Pakistan like Thar . <p> Thar , once the talking point of hunger and high children mortality rate due to malnutrition , is turning into an energy hub . Another success story in Thar is the inclusion of women in livelihood opportunities <p> This was not in the interest of the rivals of Pakistan and some international players . They launched a smear campaign against CPEC , more specifically against energy projects . <p> The favourite propaganda was against adverse impact of coal power plants , loans and corruption . First , they targeted the coal power plants , arguing that Pakistan was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through its investment in coal , which constituted only 13% of the energy mix . <p> Disappointingly , they still insist that Pakistan should immediately stop investing in coal without realising the need and poor development status of the country . <p> It seems foreign countries and companies are not interested in understanding the domestic dynamics . Thus , they are at the forefront of running a slanderous campaign against CPEC . They provide the required fuel to ignite the propaganda and spread it . <p> Critics of CPEC projects conveniently ignore two facts . First , they purposefully overlook or try to undermine the investment in renewables under the CPEC umbrella . <p> CPEC is building a good number of wind , solar and hydroelectric power projects and many of them are already operational . Hydroelectric power projects of 1,590 megawatts will start functioning in the next two years . <p> Kohala and Azad Pattan dams are other projects agreements for which have been signed only a few days ago . <p> Renewable sources <p> It is heartening to note that both China and Pakistan are working to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy projects . <p> Apart from energy , Pakistan is also heavily investing in tree plantation . The introduction of electric vehicle policy and support to the sector is another significant move to promote the green development agenda . <p> Simultaneously , Pakistan will retire 11,511MW of fossil fuel-based energy plants till 2047 . It is more than the investment in coal-based energy , leave alone other investments in renewables , plantations , electric cars and other initiatives . These all actions will help to offset the GHG emissions . <p> Secondly , they forget to mention the consumption of coal-based electricity by the developed countries and regions like the US , EU and many others . For instance , the US -- the most developed country -- produces 23.5% of electricity from coal . <p> BBC reported in January 2020 that Germany produced 35.4% of its electricity from coal . Although it is planning to phase out coal energy but gradually and in a wise manner till 2038 by providing a hefty package of 40 billion euros . <p> In the EU , coal has a 14% share in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phase out coal but it will take a long time . They can afford it as they have immensely benefited and earned the resources to do so . Though they can do it immediately as they have resources but still they are insisting on phasing out in a systematic manner . However , they pressurise Pakistan to do it immediately , which is odd . <p> Emerging economies are also following in the footsteps of developed countries . For example , India is producing 77% of electricity from coal and now PM Modi has announced the opening of new coalmines . <p> According to 2017 data , South Korea produced 44% of electricity from coal , South Africa 88% and Indonesia 58% . Russia , Japan and Turkey also feature among top 10 coal-based electricity producers . <p> Corruption allegations <p> Another point raised is corruption to malign CPEC . Unfortunately , the fuel to the campaign was provided by an incomplete assessment report , which was leaked by some vested interest groups . <p> Although rules and regulations based on which these projects were negotiated were already in place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being criticised . Chinese companies are availing facilities , which are already being offered in Pakistan . <p> Moreover , if there is any incident of corruption , Pakistan government should talk to the Chinese government directly . It would be more useful as Beijing has zero tolerance for corruption , which is clear from the anti-corruption campaign , led by President Xi Jinping . If any Chinese company is found to be involved in corruption , China will make an example out of it , for other companies . <p> To summarise , it is pertinent to mention that the smear campaign will continue as it is in the interest of opponents of CPEC . Pakistan and China should not be worried about it but they should put the right instruments in place to counter it like a well-designed engagement strategy . <p> The writer is the Director of Asia Study Centre , Sustainable Development Policy Institute

@@51837231 <p> First off , I 'm not here to bash Espresso because that has been done to death and it is quite obvious that their intention was not to make fun of a 12-year-old boy who was tragically run over by the motorcade of a political party ; and people who suggest this was the intent , lack the same common sense they are accusing the brand of . In fact , the sarcastic message was meant to make you think about the lack of empathy our elite have . <p> Nevertheless , this latest fiasco adds to a long list of local and global missteps by established brands on social media . As is the case when anything backfires on social media , the wording and the timing were off the scale . Yet , it is both rare and decent of the brand to have immediately acknowledged their error and apologised publicly . <p> This brings us to the crux of this write-up . How do these missteps happen in the first place and what can be done to ensure they do n't happen to your brand too . I mean , come on , one look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the agency and the brand teams thinking ! " Viewed in isolation , they seem to completely lack basic common sense . <p> The truth is that no brand wants to intentionally damage itself and it is very rare that the entire chain of approval authority is completely bereft of empathy and common sense . There are many reasons why these things happen and I would like to discuss two of them and the possible solutions . <p> Firstly , is underestimating the pace at which digital works . Traditional communication is neatly broken down and packaged into thematic or tactical campaigns . These are often developed months in advance , giving the people working on them the time to think things through . Most big brands launch three to six campaigns a year and these are in the planning stages a quarter in advance . Digital communication happens at a frantic pace and if you have elected to cash in on trending topics , your campaign is live and will probably have a full life cycle of a total of 48 hours . When things run at such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can act as a check against missteps . <p> The solution here is that when on digital , start with basic campaigns and slowly work your way up to trending topics . Do not go to the next level unless you are sure your team has mastered the previous one . <p> Secondly , a lot of brands do not have a standard procedure for approvals . This means that approvals are random and can be given by anyone senior , either at the agency or the brand end . There are two issues here . One , not everyone has the understanding or the language skills to comprehend the total impact of a piece of digital content . Just because you can speak basic English , does n't mean you understand the language in its current local or international nuances . Secondly , a consistent approving authority tends to see things in their total progression . Very often things are missed because the approving authority is not aware of the history and/or and context , thereby making missteps possible . <h> Would you hire a kid out of school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why are you handing the reputation of your brand to a kid and that too on an unforgiving platform such as social media ? It 's like giving the keys to your Ferrari to an 11-year-old and asking him to behave . It 's not a question of IF an accident will happen , but of WHEN it will happen . And when it does , nobody should point to the kid , but to the man who gave him the keys . <p> Here are some solutions for this . <p> Have a fixed approval procedure in place consisting of the best and most experienced members of the team in a two or three-layered approval system . Always have a senior person at both the client and agency end as the final approving authority . Millennials understand the mechanics of social media but they might not necessarily have the experience to know what is appropriate and what is not . <p> Switch from email to WhatsApp . Email can not keep up with the pace at which things happen in the digital world . You may think that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reality is that people do not check their email often enough . WhatsApp is a neat tool to keep the relevant communication on a topic in one place in real-time . Demand a similar QC structure at the agency end with clear names against each execution : copy , design , idea , brand stewardship , etc . <p> Develop clear WRITTEN guidelines of what a content team can venture into and what they can not touch with a 100-feet bargepole . Constantly update these guidelines with learnings . Giving verbal instructions or vague written ones will result in a disaster . <p> Work with professionals . If you hire interns to manage your brand , it is not the interns ' fault when things go wrong . The responsibility lies with the senior most people in the marketing team . Would you hire a kid out of school to shoot your next TVC ? If not , then why are you handing the reputation of your brand to a kid and that too on an unforgiving platform such as social media ? It 's like giving the keys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behave . It 's not a question of IF an accident will happen , but of WHEN it will happen . And when it does , nobody should point to the kid , but to the man who gave him the keys . <p> Sarcasm and dark humour are a double-edged sword . When executed perfectly , they get the eyeballs and can even go viral . But unless you are 100% confident that you have a team in place capable of dealing with a double-edged sword , avoid the temptation . Greed is a dangerous thing . Opt for a more stable pace of engagement . <p> Finally , if you do mess up , do not spend time digging in and being stubborn . Social media is both an unforgiving space as well as an understanding one . Everyone hates a stubborn , arrogant brand and it 's easier to quickly forgive one that admits to a mistake , clarifies what went wrong and tenders an apology . That would pretty much kill all the negative conversation . <p> Do you have any other solutions to avoid social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guideline and would love to hear from you if you have any thoughts on the subject . You can reach me on syedamirhaleem@gmail.com <h> Email <h> Comments ( 1 ) Closed <p> Aamir AbbasiAug 20 , 2017 11:21am <p> There is just one point I agree with and that is when he says : Just because you can speak basic English , does n't mean you understand the language in its current local or international nuances . I think here he is not saying directly but trying to refer to the cultural differences which derive the overall capability / capacity of a society to understand a concept . Multinationals usually carry out studies on culture before entering a market and accordingly shape their overall communication . Approval process has nothing to do with this . It comes way after absorbing the outcomes of your cultural research .

@@51837238 <h> At Amreli steel , things look solid <p> Amreli Steels has been having a bit of a moment for the past few months . The 48-year-old steel rebar manufacturer is riding the wave of a brand new , slick television commercial that has won internet fans that do not really associate tearjerkers with , well , sarya manufacturers . The brand 's tagline is now " Aap ki tarah solid " . But is the company actually as ' solid ' as it makes out to be ? <p> Turns out , yes . As Syed Masroor Hussain Zaidi , analyst at BMA Capital illustrates in a note issued to clients on July 7 , Amreli steel is well positioned to benefit from a bunch of ' solid ' factors . These include lower international scrap prices , and an uptick in product demand and shrinking financial charges . <p> First ( and possibly the biggest plus any steel company has ) is that Amreli Steels is a company operating in Pakistan . Why is this important ? Because Pakistan has one of the lowest consumptions of steel products on a per-capita basis , at 37kg , compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , India , 77kg , or even Vietnam at 262kg . So , given demographics and general construction , the country 's steel consumption has only one way to go from here : up . <p> Second , Amreli Steels focuses on steel rebar production . Rebar is short for reinforcing bar , and is basically reinforced steel used to help prop up and support concrete structures . Amreli has been steadily increasing its rebar capacity over the decades , from 60,000 tons annually in 1993 , to 180,000 tons annually in 2007 , to 605,000 tons annually in 2018 , according to the company website . Meanwhile , sales for Amreli steels was just above 200,000 tons in 2017 and 2018 , climbing to 300,000 tons in 2018 , and is projected to hit 335,000 tons in 2022 . <p> As one can imagine , rebar demand is tied to demand for construction . This is great , because as Zaidi points out , " We expect rebar manufacturers to be key beneficiaries of improved construction sector outlook . " According to his analysis , the manufacturers of graded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced ' big-ticket ' projects . <p> Amreli is also helped by being a large , legacy institution . This is important because the Federal Board of Revenue has launched an aggressive documentation drive , which will likely shift the share of rebar production from smaller players , to larger players , like Amreli . <p> Now , it is true that the outbreak of Covid-19 has dented this construction activity somewhat . However , Zaidi sees the recent positive data on cement sales as a proxy for construction , and thinks a revival is bound to happen . <p> According to Zaidi , the industry will grow in the medium tomorrow to 4.9 million tons in 2021 , and 5.3 million tons by 2022 . This would lead to sales of 310,000 tons for Amreli in 2021 , and 335,000 tons in 2022 . <p> Finally , international scrap prices have dropped 10% this year to date , and are expected to hover between $312 and $318 a ton between 2021 and 2023 . This means that the cost of production is expected to decrease . The result : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a company 's cost of goods sold , are expected to bounce from 8% in 2020 to 13% in 2021 . <p> Amreli Steels is also set to benefit from Pakistan 's lower interest rates . The central bank cut interest rates from 13.5% in March to 7% in June , which among other things , is hoped to improve credit availability for housing finance , one of the government 's stated goals . <p> " So far , benefits of lower interest rates have not been visible in higher credit off-take due to COVID-19 . However , going forward we expect the offtake to resume its pre-COVID trajectory . " says Zaidi . <p> Amreli steels has a very highly leveraged balance sheet , with a debt to equity ratio of 1.51 , and a debt to assets percentage of 52% . With a total debt of Rs16.18 billion , this means that lower interest rates are a huge relief for the company , and are even estimated to add Rs2.42 per share to earnings in 2021 . The improved gross margins mentioned earlier , along with these reduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand at 4% in 2021 . <p> Is there anything that could upset this promising story ? Zaidi has a few concerns that are out of the company 's control . <p> For instance , the sector has not emerged from an ongoing expansionary cycle , which means prices could remain ' under pressure ' . If that happens , then any costs like tariffs or scrap prices will not be able to be passed on to the consumer , affecting Amreli 's costs . This is somewhat concerning , only because Amreli heavily depends on the electricity grid . A hike there would throw Amreli 's cost structure askew .

@@51905232 <h> For a new system of accountability <h> Opinion <p> A Persian proverb says that if a mason tilts the first brick , the building will be raised tilted right to the stars . This is true about the National Accountability Bureau . <p> Mir Shakil-ul-Rahman is incarcerated in a flimsy 34-year-old bilateral civil matter . Shahid Khaqan Abbasi was arrested in July 2019 but still no reference has been filed against him . It is not difficult for objective commentators and observers to agree that a usurper promulgated the National Accountability Bureau Ordinance 1999 for a witch-hunt against democratic forces . Laws based on the NAB laws and their practice has damaged our political system , business , civil service , state and society . <p> The honourable Supreme Court in a recent judgment has summed up this reality : " Rather than doing any good to the country or our body politic and cleansing the fountain heads of governance , these laws and the manner in which they were enforced , caused further degeneration and created chaos , since the same were framed and applied with an oblique motive of arm twisting and pressurizing political opponents into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the electoral scene at least temporarily ... ' <p> This expression of truth emerging from the Supreme Court can not be stressed enough . It is high time to substitute the NAB law with a new law , inter alia , for the following reasons . <p> The NAB law was promulgated under Martial Law and it is there as a fait accompli . Successive governments could not change or amend it as they did not have either the will or the majority in both Houses , and consensus was felt to be necessary in order to avoid any problem or blame . A new accountability law , then , should be enacted after a thorough debate in the public , via the media and parliament . <p> In the NAB law the definitions given of ' accused ' , ' associate ' , ' holder of public office ' , ' wrongful default ' are vague and wide . The definition of ' corruption and corrupt practices ' also is too elusive . These need to be properly defined in a new law in light of constitutional guarantees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our superior courts . <p> Only the NAB chairman can order arrest , freeze property , transfer cases from one court to another , accept plea bargains and voluntary return , tender pardon and make approvers . All such powers being vested in a single person becomes a source of many a grave problem . All these powers should be vested in a commission consisting of members drawn from various specialties ( law , accounts , investigation and administration ) . <p> The NAB chairman can appoint employees and consultants without the Federal Public Service Commission of Pakistan ( FPSC ) , a constitutional body to select civil servants . These powers are not available even to the president of Pakistan . All such new appointments and promotions should be made by the FPSC and all existing appointments can be scrutinized by the FPSC within three months of the new law being promulgated . <p> The NAB law shifts the burden of proof from NAB to the accused persons against the well-established legal maxim about presumption of innocence , practised in the civilized world . The burden is sometimes shifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is being misused . In the new law , principles of ' presumption of innocence ' and ' onus of proof ' should be reflected in the interest of justice . <p> The disqualification of an accused from holding a public office starts from its first conviction . Right now , NAB court convicts a person , s/he is disqualified and de-seated and after a few years , s/he is declared innocent in an appeal . This disqualification for this intervening period is unfair , unjust and against natural justice . Therefore , disqualification should start from final adjudication of the matter by the final court . <p> The Code of Criminal Procedure , 1898 , ( Code ) is the main procedural law applicable in all criminal cases including cases of murder and terrorism but the NAB court may dispense with any provision of the Code and follow such procedure as it may deem fit . This power is not available to a high court . This power should be taken away from the NAB court and the Code shall apply in the NAB proceedings . <p> When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accused person or any relative or associate , can not transfer or create a charge on any property owned by him , while the inquiry , investigation or proceedings are pending before the NAB or the court and any transfer or creation of a charge shall be void and any violation shall be punishable . This draconian provision ruins the whole business of the accused . This provision shall be limited to the property related to the alleged crime only and shall be dependent on the order of the court with an appeal to a high court . <p> Under normal criminal laws , an accused can be sent on physical remand only up to 14 days whereas under NAB law , an accused person can be detained for a period of ninety days . All the cases of NAB are based on documentary evidence ; therefore , there is no need to detain a person for so long and so physical remand should be reduced to 14 days . <p> Where a holder of public office or any other person voluntarily comes forward and offers to return the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voluntary return ) , the NAB chairman may accept such offer , and discharge such person from all his liability . In practice , this is done under duress and coercion and , therefore , these powers shall be either taken away or shall be properly defined and linked with the court . <p> The NAB chairman may , at any stage of inquiry , investigation or trial , with a view to obtaining the evidence of any person , tender a full or conditional pardon to such a person who shall not be tried for the offence . The chairman may also withdraw this pardon . This power is usually misused and civil servants are coerced to become approvers against politicians . Interestingly , such approvers though admit their guilt but are allowed to continue their services without even efficiency and disciple proceedings . The pardon procedure should be as it is stipulated under the Code . <p> NAB employees may be paid by the chairman bonuses or ex ? -gratia payments for rendering commendable services in detection , investigation and prosecution of any offence . How can an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonly NAB ? This scheme should be scrapped all together . <p> NAB has an indemnity from any civil suit , prosecution etc , while exercising any power or performing any function whereas the police do not enjoy any such indemnity ; the police in fact have a penalty of five years under section 156 of the Police Order 2002 if a police officer without reasonable cause , enters or searches ; or seizes the property of any person ; or unnecessarily detains , searches or arrests any person etc . Similar provision should also be added in a new law to match the accountability with responsibility . <p> All the offences under the NAB law are non- ? bailable and no court , including the high court or the Supreme Court , has jurisdiction to grant bail to any person accused of any offence -- though bail is available in murder or terrorism cases . It is a common practice that NAB-accused persons languish in jails for many years and are then acquitted . The courts should have the power to grant bail . <p> The NAB law and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is against the time-tested principles of criminal law , international best practices and inalienable human dignity .

Nationwide , of 435 congressional seats up for grabs , 144 are in districts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machines using paper records , the analysis shows . While something could go wrong in any of those districts , it is in the close elections where a miscount or a perception of a miscount matters most . <p> Most of the dozen-plus state and local election officials interviewed by Reuters said they worry about bad actors hacking the older electronic voting machines to alter ballots , and then being unable to verify the results because there will be no paper trail . But the officials worry most about voters losing trust in elections , because officials would not be able to visibly demonstrate that the tally was indeed accurate . <p> " Voter confidence is a really big thing , and it 's the battle I worry about losing , " said Pennsylvania 's elections commissioner , Jonathan Marks . His state has four of the country 's most hotly contested elections -- all of them in counties that use the older machines . <p> While there is no evidence that any voting machines were hacked in the 2016 presidential election of Donald Trump , there is increased anxiety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia actively sought , mostly through manipulation of social media , to sow distrust . <p> Trump himself has been accused by opponents of undermining confidence in the U.S. election system by falsely claiming that Hillary Clinton 's victory in the popular vote was due to massive voter fraud in favor of his Democratic opponent . No evidence of such fraud has been found . <p> A NEED FOR PAPER <p> Most election officials interviewed by Reuters said they neither have the time nor the money to install voting machines that have a verifiable paper backup in time for the 2018 election . Officials believe paper is the best way to verify disputed election results because it can be physically examined and counted . <p> The Department of Homeland Security declared last year that Russian hackers had probed election-related computer systems in 21 of the 50 states during the 2016 election and that a small number were compromised . U.S. officials said , however , there was no evidence votes were altered in 2016 . <p> Intelligence agencies expect more meddling leading up to the 2018 elections . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to undermine confidence in our democratic institutions remains , " said Matt Masterson , senior cyber security adviser in the Department of Homeland Security . <p> Voting machines are generally not connected to the internet and therefore are difficult to hack . But even if hackers do n't get in during the moments they might be linked to the internet , if voters are led to believe that the results are faked or mistallied , the mistrust of the system could undermine faith in elections , said Washington State Secretary of State Kim Wyman . <p> " If people perceive somebody cheated , then it 's as if somebody cheated , " said Wyman . <p> TOO LITTLE , TOO LATE <p> Many states switched to electronic voting machines after paper ballot disputes cast a pall over Republican George W. Bush 's victory over Democrat Al Gore in 2000 . But with cybersecurity a nascent concern at the time , securing machines against potential hackers was largely an afterthought . <p> Last fall , Virginia became the only state since the 2016 election to replace all of its paperless touchscreen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The state acted after hackers at the annual Def Con hacking conference in Las Vegas demonstrated how they could quickly break into electronic machines , including some of the models used in Virginia . Other states ordered their counties to upgrade , but they were delayed by lack of money and the difficult logistics of procuring new equipment . <p> For the most part , the Def Con exercise discovered vulnerabilities by physically accessing voting machines , in some cases literally pulling them apart to find security weaknesses . <p> Earlier this year , Congress appropriated $380 million to upgrade election systems across the country , but state and local officials say the amount is both too little and comes too late for them to buy new machines for the 2018 election . <p> In Pennsylvania , for instance , the state has ordered local jurisdictions , which are charged with administering elections , to update their systems by 2019 . It will cost up to $150 million , said Kathy Boockvar , Pennsylvania 's senior adviser to the governor on election modernization , but the federal government funding provides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shore up their systems in the meantime , DHS offers states weekly updates on cyber threats and sends computer experts to check the security of local systems , said Masterson , the cybersecurity adviser at Homeland Security . <p> Florida hired a cybersecurity firm to analyze its systems . <p> In Kentucky , the state brought in federal advisers to train county election chiefs on security risks .

@@51917240 <h> Why are we not storing all this rainwater in Karachi ? <p> Nagan Chowrangi on August 24 , Monday after 150mm fell during the week , flooding North Karachi . PHOTO : ONLINE/Sabir Mazhar <p> The irony is lost on no one : turn on the tap and there is no water , but look outside and rivers are flowing on Karachi 's roads because this monsoon has been rather unusual . Some of the rainwater that floods the roads will eventually seep down into the water table . But most of it will make its way to the sea . In fact , according to a rough estimate 90% of Karachi 's rainwater ends up in the sea . For those who do not get regular supplies at home , though , it does seem like a waste . For could that water not be stored for use later on ? Part of the problem is that the rainwater floods the city before eventually draining into the sea because it can not be absorbed by the ground . This does not happen because Karachi has become a concrete jungle . The more we have paved over , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorb . Karachi 's exponential growth means that concrete has blocked the natural ground that could absorb rainwater . The advantage would have been that the water table would have been replenished . All year round Karachi suffers a water shortage . KWSB provides just half of what the city needs . As a result , boring to extract groundwater is rampant . Experts are worried that this widespread private boring in houses across the city will lower the water table . It used to be the case in Karachi that if you dug 50 feet down , you 'd hit sweetwater because the water table was unpolluted . But today if you bore down , you have go as deep as 300 feet to get water and when you do find it , it is brackish and undrinkable . According to an expert , if the extraction of groundwater happens faster than the rain replenishes it , we will face a drought . The danger of boring is also that it lowers the groundwater table . When that happens , the soil becomes drier and sandier . This has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened in Quetta where ground subsidence or the subsiding or sinking of the ground happens . Cracks develop in your house or building walls as a result . The drier the ground the less it is able to take the load of the buildings . This is why we see so many ' sinkhole ' type gaps in our roads , for example . Human activity in the shape of altering the natural environment by building has this net effect . According to an expert , Karachi 's seismicity has also increased over the last 15 years or so . We see small activity on the Richter Scale of around 3.2 . This medium or moderate activity also affects our built environment . We can make natural dams in areas with a depression to store rainwater . This can be done without any government intervention as well , especially where there are high-rise buildings . All you need to do is place a mesh that can act as a filter to ensure garbage does n't go into any storage facility you have made . This monsoon has reminded us of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 150mm and residents watched as fresh rains fell on Tuesday to add to the existing standing water . Ideally , we would make artificial lakes or urban wetlands to soak up the extra water and unusual monsoon patterns . Rainwater harvesting is our only hope .

There is need to address trade imbalance by diversifying trading products and taking other steps . <p> He invited his attention to some of the main areas which required his consideration , for the sake of furtherness of business relationship between Pakistan and Malaysia that include : - <p> 1 ) Export of rice : Pakistan is the major producer and exporter of rice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exported 4.100 million tons of rice valuing $2.20 billion . There is need to increase the volume of export of Pakistani IRRI and Basmati rice to Malaysia , as volume of Malaysian import from Pakistan during the year 2019-20 was about 131,000 M Tons , as compared to Malaysian annual requirement of over 1,000,000 Tons . Malaysian government , mainly its importing agency BARNAS needs to be asked to increase import of Pakistani rice considerably , so as to ensure promotion of export of rice from Pakistan . <p> 2 ) Export of Fruits/Fresh Vegetable : <p> i ) Malaysia is a potential buyer of fresh fruits and vegetables , which Pakistan exports to Malaysia . Malaysia has imposed 5% &amp; 7% duty on import of mangoes and mandarin ( Kinoo ) respectively . For the sake of promotion of exports of fruits , there is need to review/abolish Malaysian duty on fruits . <p> ii ) There are cumbersome procedure in respect of packing and labelling and other requirements in respect of import of fruits and fresh vegetables in Malaysia . It is necessary that the procedure may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( especially for mangoes ) is mandatory in Malaysia , which may either be abolished or converted into one time permit for each season/year to simplify formalities . <p> iv ) Another impediment in this regard is that there is no regular direct flight from Pakistan to Malaysia , which is also essential for transportation of fruits , vegetables and other perishable commodities , which also need consideration . <p> 3 ) Import of Palm Oil : Trade between Pakistan and Malaysia has declined considerably as the Malaysian share in the import of Palm Oil to Pakistan has drastically decreased to 20% , owing to availability and price factors , whereas 80% is being imported from Indonesia <p> 4 ) Wood Products of Fibreboards : <p> a ) High Density Fibreboards ( HDF ) <p> ( i ) On import of this product ( HS Code 411.9200 ) from Malaysia , Customs duty is 20% and for HDF intermediary is nature ( HS Code 441192 ) it was reduced to 16% since 2013-14 . <p> ( ii ) Under Pak-Sri Lanka FTA , there is ZERO duty for the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ import from Malaysia . Therefore , uniformity is required by bringing the said item at ZERO percent duty to match with the Pak-Sri Lanka FTA . <p> ( iii ) Accordingly , due consideration for elimination of tariff rate to ZERO duty on HS Code 4411.9200 may please be accorded for achieving higher level trade liberalization and effective market access between Pakistan and Malaysia , which is the basic object and main spirit of FTA . <p> b ) Medium Density Fibreboard ( MDF ) <p> i ) MDF is mainly imported in Pakistan from a few countries like Malaysia , Thailand , Sri Lanka , China and Indonesia . Statutory rate of customs duty on this item is 11% and regulatory duty is 5 % and it is also subject to 2% additional customs duty . <p> II ) However , under Pakistan-Sri Lanka FTA , import of MDF from Sri Lanka has been exempted from the whole of customs duty and therefore Sri Lankan raw MDF and value-added MDF enjoy clear cut advantage of 14.5 percent-15 percent in terms of duties and this makes imports of raw MDF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malaysia , uncompetitive . <p> iii ) Pakistani importers of MDF have been deprived of level playing field , since they are at a disadvantageous position , while importing it from Malaysia , especially the commercial importers who have also to bear the burden of 1l% . <p> Customs duty plus 2% additional customs duty and 5% regulatory duty on their imports from Malaysia and in turn Malaysia is also losing market in Pakistan . <p> C ) It is therefore concluded that whole of duty on import of high density fibreboards ( HDF ) &amp; medium density fibreboards ( MDF ) from Malaysia may be exempted and kept at ZERO duty level , at par Sri Lanka in order to promote level-playing field to Pakistani importers . <p> 5 ) Review of FTA : There are certain areas/issues regarding Free Trade Agreement ( FTA ) between Pakistan and Malaysia about duty and permit/quota and other anomalies , which are also needed to be resolved/removed through negotiations at the level of both the governments and in upcoming JRC meeting of MPCEPA , so as to further boost bilateral trade and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still far from its potential . <p> 6 ) Oil Palm Plantation in Pakistan : In context with promotion of local oilseed cultivation , Malaysian technical know-how about " Oil Palm plantation " in Pakistan is needed .

@@51958231 <p> ARTICLE : While Tehran 's new strategic partnership with Beijing ( a 25-year $400b arrangement ) will give the Chinese a strategic foothold and strengthen Iran 's economy and regional clout , the development opens a new window of socio-economic opportunities for Pakistan via the $62b China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ) which is a crucial lynchpin of China 's global Road and Belt initiative ( RBI ) . <p> In the immediate aftermath of the China-Iran agreement , India would stand removed from the Chabahar port project . In 2016 , India and Iran signed an agreement to invest in Iran 's strategic Chabahar Port and to construct the railway connecting the southeastern port city of Chabahar to the eastern city of Zahedan and to link India to landlocked Afghanistan and Central Asia bypassing Pakistan and in the process diminishing Pakistan 's pre-eminent position as landlocked Afghanistan 's main transit trade partner . <p> While Iranian officials have refused to link India 's removal from Chabahar-Zahedan project to the new deal with China , it seems that India 's close ties to Washington had led to this decision . Prime Minister Narendra Modi government 's Kashmir policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 200 million Muslims are said to have also played a significant role in influencing Iran 's decision . <p> However , Tehran said that the decision to the effect was taken because seemingly under pressure from the US India was dragging its feet over investment in the project . <p> Replacing India with China in such a strategic project is expected to alter the balance of power in South Asia to the detriment of New Delhi . China now has the chance to connect Chabahar Port to Gwadar in Pakistan , which as mentioned earlier , is a critical hub in the BRI programme . <p> Iran 's inclusion in the BRI framework is also likely to cause India to lose ground against China in Afghanistan . After 9/11 , Indian political and economic influence grew in Afghanistan under the US security umbrella . Since the February deal between the US and the Taliban in Doha , however , India 's influence over the country has been shrinking . India was neither part of the US-Taliban deal , nor does it have any significant role in the intra-Afghan peace process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country is expected to minimize further . <p> Despite Washington 's prodding , New Delhi has been ambivalent about entering into dialogue with the Taliban . China , on the other hand , has long been engaging both with the Kabul government and the Taliban in an effort to not only secure its economic investments and interests in Afghanistan in the aftermath of US withdrawal , but also undercut those of India . This also gives China an edge to potentially connect the post-US Afghanistan in the BRI framework . China 's growing ties to Iran - a country that has significant clout over and ties with Afghanistan - is likely to help it achieve this goal . <p> The new China-Iran relationship is likely to ultimately undermine India 's interests in the region , particularly if Pakistan gets on board . And there is no reason why Pakistan would not get on board . The implementation of Iran 's proposal to expand the existing China-Pakistan Economic Corridor along northern , western , and southern axes and link Gwadar Port in Pakistan to Chabahar and then to Europe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks more probable . If that plan proceeds , the golden ring consisting of China , Pakistan , Iran , Russia , and Turkey will turn into the centerpiece of BRI , linking China to Iran and onward to Central Asia , the Caspian Sea , and to the Mediterranean Sea through Iraq and Syria . <p> China 's involvement in Iran would weaken Pakistan 's main rival India , and open up strategic space for Islamabad to efficiently deal with political and security threats it is currently facing as well as expand its socio-economic links across a huge swath of contiguous land encompassing Iran , Afghanistan and Central Asia . <p> After fully integrating Iran into the BRI framework , Beijing could help Islamabad improve its relations with Tehran and assist the two countries in pacifying the Iran-Pakistan border along Balochistan which is actually being undermined currently by the US proxies working from Pakistani Balochistan and Indian proxies working off Iranian Balochistan . <p> Chinese presence in Iran would mean the Iranian port city of Chabahar would not compete with Pakistan 's Gwadar , whose port is operated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean the transit trade from Afghanistan and Central Asia would continue through Pakistani ports . <p> The agreement between Beijing and Tehran will see China invest in banking , transport and development sectors in Iran . In exchange , Beijing expects to receive a regular , and heavily discounted , supply of Iranian oil over the next 25 years . The deal is part of Chinese President Xi Jinping 's ambitious Belt and Road Initiative ( BRI ) that aims to extend his country 's economic and strategic influence across Eurasia . <p> The new deal between Beijing and Tehran includes plans for China to develop several ports in Iran , such as the Bandar-e-Jask which is strategically situated to the east of the Strait of Hormoz . This is significant as it gives Beijing control over one of the seven key maritime chokepoints in the world . This can potentially undermine the US naval dominance in the Middle East , as having a foothold in Bandar-e-Jask would not only allow China to monitor the US Navy 's Fifth Fleet based in Bahrain , but together with a presence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence in the Indian Ocean Region . All this could cause India to lose the leverage its close ties to the US provides against China . <p> These developments have thrown open a new window of socio-economic opportunities for Pakistan . But in order to make the most of this opportunity Pakistan would need to first study the potential rather closely along with the various scenarios emerging out of the regional realignment . There is a possibility that a cold-war kind of a situation might emerge eventually between two blocs - one led by the US and the other by China . Pakistan will have to take sides in such an eventuality . Perhaps , such a confrontation after all woud not emerge if the Democrats win the upcoming US election . In such a case Pakistan can continue working with the two competing sides . <p> More importantly , Pakistani planners would need to do an indepth study of the huge market opening on its Western , Northern and North-Western borders extending from Afghanistan to Central Asia along with Iran plus Western China . We need to find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would need to import from it with the supply chain seamlessly connecting the entire market . <p> What distinguishes the China-Iran regional realignment from other recent global developments is that both China and Iran have global and regional ambitions , both have confrontational relationships with the United States , and there is a security component to the agreement . The military aspect of the agreement concerns the United States . Last year 's unprecedented Iran-China-Russia joint naval exercise in the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Oman had caused President Donald Trump several sleepless nights . <p> China 's growing influence in East Asia and Africa has challenged U.S. interests , and the Middle East is likely to be the next battlefield on which Beijing can challenge the US hegemony-this time through Iran . <p> This is particularly important since the agreement and its implications go beyond the economic sphere and bilateral relations : It operates at the internal , regional , and global level . <p> Internally , the agreement can be an economic lifeline for Iran , saving its sanctions-hit , cash-strapped economy by ensuring the sale of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iran will be able to use its strategic ties with China as a bargaining chip in any possible future negotiations with the West by taking advantage of its ability to expand China 's footprint in the Persian Gulf . <p> In the long term , Iran 's strategic proximity to China implies that Tehran is adapting the so-called " Look East " policy in order to boost its regional and military power and to defy and undermine US power in the Persian Gulf region . <p> For China , the pact can help guarantee its energy security . The Persian Gulf supplies more than half of China 's energy needs . <p> Saudi Arabia , a close US ally , has now become the top supplier of crude oil to China , as Chinese imports from the kingdom in May set a new record of 2.16 million barrels per day . This dependence is at odds with China 's general policy of diversifying its energy sources and not being reliant on one supplier . China 's other Arab oil suppliers in the Persian Gulf region have close security ties with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that as the trade war between the two countries intensifies , the US may put pressure on those countries not to supply Beijing with the energy it needs . A comprehensive strategic partnership with Iran is being seen both as a hedge and an insurance policy ; it can provide China with a guaranteed and discounted source of energy . <p> China understands Iran 's strategic position and its importance as a regional power in the ' new ' Middle East . Regional developments in recent years have consolidated Iran 's influence . Unlike the United States , China has adopted an apolitical development-oriented approach to the region , utilizing Iran 's regional power to expand economic relations with nearby countries and establish security in the region through what it calls developmental peace-rather than the Western notion of democratic peace .

@@51958232 <p> While the new Renewable Energy ( RE ) Policy , 2019 has finally seen the light of the day , the fate of renewable energy sector that has been hanging since so long in this country has still to see the same . The most notable deviation that this policy is making from its preceding counterparts is the outright exclusion of Feed in Tariff ( FiT ) and the negotiated or cost-plus tariff optionsbehind the reason of competitive bidding or auctions . That simply means that all the eggs have been put in the basket of energy auctions for the renewables , assuming it a risk free option which actually is not the case so far ; especially in the face of recent failure of auctions at the globallevel . The framers of this policy failed to understand that it is not the provision of auction itself but the reduction in the cost of technology is the factor which actually reduces the tariff of RE worldwide . <p> As a logical corollary of this policy , if any auction fails in future , then the fate of renewables should wait for the another new policy to come . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to waste couple of more years as has been witnessed in the present situation when it cost almost two and a half years . Long or short , this new policy has visibly axed the government 's inviolable prerogative of exercising multiple tariff options , so the spoilage seems flagrant . This policy has only one comparable parallel in the history , and that was Power Policy 1998 , which also excluded other tariff options except competitive bidding for the power projects . That policy remained miserable failure in the past but it seems no lesson has so far been learnt from that debacle . <p> Furthermore , the same pathway of auctions and competitive bidding was already well enumerated within the RE Policy 2006 in the form of ' Solicited Projects ' , which altogether defies the need for RE Policy 2019 and exposes the weakness within policy making process . <p> The RE Policy document itself advocates the exclusion of FiT ( Feed-in-Tariff ) and the option of negotiated tariffs , considering the wind and solar as mature technologies . If this is true , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coal , then why not to follow the same policy doctrine in those cases . Why exclusive auctions are destined only for renewable energy ? And why not for thermal projects ? Presently when wind and solar tariff is already touching the tariff of below 5 and 4.5 cents per kwh in the country , the exclusive option of auctions had to be diverted for thermal projects . <p> The RE Policy 2019 document at the very onset is covered with a beautiful wrapper of anticipated targets i.e. 20% share of RE in the electricity mix by 2025 and 30% by 2030 , which actually is labelled is nothing but a marketing chip . In contrast , these targets are not endorsed by the figures in the NTDC 's ( National Transmission and Dispatch Company ) own Indicative Generation Capacity Expansion Plan ( IGCEP ) . In the face of COVID-19 and concomitant suppression of energy demand in the country , the RE targets seem hard to be achieved . <p> As a matter of fact , the term of the previous RE Policy 2006 has never been fixed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same year . It was not until year 2013 , when ECC while approving the Framework for Power Cogeneration 2013 ( Bagasse/Biomass ) as an addendum to the RE Policy 2006 extended the RE Policy 2006 for additional five years from the date of the decision , i.e. till March , 2018 . Such a controversial decision has been unprecedented , rather unreasonable vis-a-vis the history and logic of policy making ; fixing the validity of policy for five years ahead when such fixation of the term has never been demanded by the parent organization i.e. AEDB ( Alternative Energy Development Board ) . How come the approving body can straight away predict the obsolescence of the policy afterthe next five years without seeking even its review and performance ? In the absence of logic and technical sense , such master strokes of disconformity and confusion appear to lay the foundation of forthcoming flawed decisions which is truly regretful . <p> The above is the anomalous background of the decision for converging towards New Re Policy 2019 . Quite interestingly , the decision to rescind the previous policy and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top side of the incumbent government nor from the AEDB ( Alternative Energy Development Board ) . Hence , this policy shift isdistinctively devoid of any technical analysis anddue validation on record . As the matter of fact , anyshift towards new policy becomes only inevitable when the previous totally falls short towards achieving the desired ends and it becomes extremely necessary to change the course.This has never been the case with the previous RE Policy 2006 , which was already on its way of achieving the yardsticks of desired outcomes and targets successfully . <p> Moreover , the specific availability of cost plus tariff mode only for the Government to Government ( G to G ) procurement of projects not only defies the norms of fair-play , rather seems to evaporate the trust of investors blatantly . With the visible and standing primacy of G to G arrangement in the RE Policy document , any unforeseen political bargain if strikes with any country may ultimately seal the fate of open market investment prospects ; especially under the suppressed demand situation . Another drawback in the policy is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is rather incomprehensible . <p> While adding insult to injury , the " Mandatory Purchase " feature of renewable energy , the continuation of fiscal incentives for investors , and the simplicity of the procurement process have been significantly put on uncertain and unpredictable grounds , that leaves nothing but the bleak horizons for the uplift of RE sector in the country.In nut shell , although the RE Policy document seems to exhorts the preeminence of renewable energy in Pakistan , however a convoluted web of ifs and buts as well its glaring irrelevance with the ground realities seems to ruin this delectable narrative .

@@51981235 <h> Pakistan-Expanding dimensions of foreign affairs <p> Foreign policy is the country 's first line of defence and militarism is a political orientation of a government or people to maintain a strong military force to use aggressively to defend or promote national interests.A country 's foreign policyconsists of strategies chosen by the state to safeguard its vital national interests . There are two guiding principles of Pakistan 's foreign policy , the first is the desire to ' escape India ' in the sense of creating a national identity based on two nations theory . Thus , Pakistan has preferred to be referred to as a " Greater Middle Eastern " country and not as a South Asian one.The second principle is the desire for parity with India . Additionally , since its inception the foreign stratagem of Pakistan has always been uncertain when it comes to myriads of crucial matters such as its relations with Saudi Arabia , Iran , Israel and Pakistan 's role amidst the great powers like the US , USSR , and China . <p> Pakistan-Saudi relations have been strong for decades since Saudi Arabia is a major source of financial support for Pakistan.Riyadh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue and the two have been allies for decades in Afghan conflict.But recently , Pakistan- Saudi relations have gone uncomfortable for a while . Saudi Arabia is not happy with Pakistan for fraternizing with Iran , Turkey and Malaysia which are rivals to Riyadh 's leadership of the Muslim world . Another important reason for Saudi Arabia cracking the whip on Pakistan is Saudis ' strengthening economic and security relationship with India therefore avoiding traditional solidarity on Kashmir issue . <p> India though strictlyadheres to the dictum that road to Washington DC lies through Tel Aviv , yetSaudi Arabia and India have traditionally enjoyed close friendly relations . The current scenario is unlike the " Cold War " period when India-Saudi Arabia ties were determined by ' Pakistani factor ' . Saudi Arabia willfullyselected a tangent and mild approach on abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir and had signaled that it understands Indian concerns and sensitivities on the Kashmir issue . <p> Engagement between Washington and Jerusalem could include China as a regular item in discussions and policy decisions <p> The Saudi Arabia -Iran and the USA-Iranrivalry is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India'sMiddle Eastforeign policy . India has close relations with both Saudi Arabia as well as Iran but yet needs to work out a way to balance it.Pakistan must manage the Saudi-Iran rivalry with equal care and should never provide its turf as a battleground for the sectarian confrontation of these countries . <p> China has become a crucial partner to Saudi Arabia being one of the largest oil clients , but the United States is nevertheless providing defense umbrella to the Middle East . Chinese does n't want to take over or relieve / share this responsibility considering the United States influence in the Middle East . <p> It is not clear if Saudi funding of militant anti-Shiite , anti-Iranian madrassas that dot the Iran-Pakistan border is government-sourced or tacitly endorsed by Riyadh . Sufficient evidence indicates the Saudis are considering the possibility of destabilizing Iran by stirring unrest among its ethnic minorities . If Saudi Arabia and the USA wanted to wage a war against Iran , Baluchistan would be part of the battleground , which is the center point of China 's BRI . <p> The key question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arabia and Iran , and at what point will it become an issue ? China 's relationship with Iran is much older than China 's relations with Saudi Arabia . Chinese and Iranians understand each other on a deeper level as each one book-ends the Asian continent . Iran as a land-link for China 's Belt and Road Initiative ( BRI ) makes Iran important since one BRI corridor ends in Tehran . <p> Since the early 2000s , relations between China and Israel have expanded rapidly in numerous areas , including diplomacy , trade , investment , construction , educational partnerships , scientific cooperation , and tourism . China 's primary interests in Israel are advanced technology and Israel 's location as part of the Belt and Road Initiative . Israel seeks to expand its diplomatic and economic ties with the world 's fastest growing major economy to diversify its export markets and investments from the United States and Europe . Although evolving relations with China present Israel with important opportunities , they also present a variety of challenges . <p> Engagement between Washington and Jerusalem could include China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israel and the United States may ensure regular information-sharing and joint monitoring of the nature and extent of Chinese investments and economic activities in Israel and in the broader Middle East . This is especially important as growing voices in Israel call for developing a process to scrutinize Chinese economic practices more closely . <p> The diplomatic brass of Pakistan is likely to encounter numerous formidable challenges in the near future . Pakistan ended up in the quagmire during the Cold War , the problem is going to get worse in the coming years as one contender of global supremacy , China is a direct neighbour . <p> After the revocation of article 370 , India faced the slightest of condemnation because of her sounder foreign relations and economic standing in the world and the sooner Pakistan realises thisfact , the better it will be . The Ongoing Afghan peace process ought to be observed meticulously . Pakistan should look for alternatives to safeguard its national interests by giving way to a new dawn , which is not based on perpetual obsession in Afghanistan . Pakistan 's foreign policy has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East and South Asia , to a strategy that is moving towards developing and strengthening relations with China , Iran , and Russia . The changing priorities behind Pakistan 's strategic interests have accentuated the need to secure : new sources of energy ; new markets for its products , services and labour ; a way to contain and limit India 's expanding regional influence and the necessity to retain an amicable relationship with the USA . Furthermore , Pakistan has never encountered a direct or indirect covert as well as overt hostile threat from Israel except a few fictional stories by radical elements . This is the opportune moment for exploring the avenue to normalize diplomatic ties with Israel as the Arab World is already moving forward in this restricted space .

@@51981236 <h> Lithium Ion battery for submarines : the game of future survival <p> The submarine world is now undergoing some of the fundamental changes it 's seen in the last 40 years and there are signs that those changes may be the biggest , since the order was first given to " take her down . " New technologies are producing capabilities long known to be possible , but not practical . However , with the introduction of superior weapons &amp; sensors , powerful combat suites , capability to launch special payloads like Unmanned Underwater Vehicles ( UUVs ) &amp; Autonomous underwater vehicle ( AUVs ) , land attack capability , enhanced submerged autonomy rendered by the combination of Air Independent Propulsion system ( AIP ) and lithium ion battery ( LiB ) ; a conventional sub has now entered the immunity and capacity domain of a nuclear boat . <p> For nearly a century , diesel-electric submarines relied on constantly charging traditional lead-acid batteries by running their diesel engines either on the surface or later on , while snorkeling near the surface . This left them constantly vulnerable , as they could only hide deep beneath the surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Over the last few decades , AIP technology has further revolutionized her traditional performance . But now , these platforms are on the verge of yet another advancement ; one that will make them return to their original wolf pack roots , relying on diesel engines and batteries alone to go about clandestine business . <p> As for the AIP systems , the most modern versions like Stirling Engines , MESMA Closed-Cycle Steam Turbine System and Fuel Cells power the submarine , while it is submerged for long periods of time . Each approach has its own pros &amp; cons with difference in cost and technological aspect are major factors beside performance of each system . <p> For instance , Sweden Stirling Engines , although the technology is well proven and affordable , it also requires the boat to carry liquid oxygen oxidizer , which can have its own complexities as well as inert gas to mix with it . The Stirling Engines and other infrastructure needed to make the system work ; much of a relatively small submarine 's bulk gets taken up by the system . Additionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which can make noise even when a high-degree of soundproofing is designed into the submarine . The French MESMA AIP uses ethanol and liquid oxygen combustion to produce steam for spinning a turbine to generate electricity . The cost of system is slightly on the higher side . Finally , Fuel Cell based AIP is very quiet as there are few moving parts in the system . It also is a very efficient system for long endurance missions . But again , this kind of system uses liquid oxygen and hydrogen as basic fuels . It is thought that Australia 's upcoming Shortfin Barracuda Submarines , of French origin , will use reformer Fuel Cell AIP propulsion . Israel 's latest Dolphin Class boats also use fuel cell AIP , being Israel 's second-strike nuclear deterrent . <p> While all sensors and weapons being equal , a Navy has to justify what type of diesel electric submarine to choose based not just on cost but also on what type of tactics they aim to employ and what type of combat environment they are most likely to operate in . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , along with the need for maximum stealth , fuel cell AIP technology may be best . If bursts of high-speed during attack and evasion maneuvers are needed , MESMA system be considered most appropriate . For moderate-range littoral combat operations , the Stirling Engine-based AIP technology may make more sense . <p> It would be prudent to mention that with great leaps realized in submarine battery technology , AIP systems may soon face competition in the submarine world as Japanese Navy seems to have pioneered a concept that aims to eliminate the need of AIP , altogether . It 's next generation 4,200 tons , Soryu Class diesel-electric attack submarines are equipped with lithium-ion batteries . This new configuration would result in quieter operation than most existing AIP capable submarines . Similarly , South Korea has equally shown exceptional indigenous resolve in development of this hi-tech product for it 's submarines . <p> Lithium-ion batteries have a ton of advantages over their old-school lead-acid cousins . They keep up their output even when their charge runs low , they are lighter than lead-acid batteries , they can be charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Compared to the AIP system ( they aim to replace ) , submerged autonomy or endurance shall be similar or even greater , while the overall boat 's design and construction will be slim and less intricate . Not just that , lithium-ion batteries are now sea-proven and allow the boat to dash much faster -- much frequently while dived , as compared to running on an AIP system alone . <p> History has , nevertheless , shown that Submarine Warfare is something that hinges on the spirit of crews sealed for months in an atmosphere of easy informality , close camaraderie , and iron self-discipline . It comes from intense , highly technical training and experience at sea . It demands consistent efforts in analyzing threats and adaptation to the evolving technologies . <p> Remaining oblivious to future challenges will certainly raise perils . It is to be realized , how best to cope up with this phenomenal shift . Lest we forget ; " Chance only favours the prepared mind " .

It also does not come in with small investments and it certainly does not come in unless the startup is making multi-million dollars in Gross Merchandise Value ( GMV ) . Had it been a few years ago , Naspers would n't have invested in Pakistan 's startups , for there were none that could meet its high standards . <p> But today , Bykea met those standards as the transport and logistics platform announced raising $13 million in its Series-B round , out of which $10 million has been put in by South Africa-based Naspers through its Netherlands-based spinoff venture arm Prosus Ventures .

The funds put in by existing investors as well as the valuation of the company after the round remain undisclosed . <p> This is the first time Naspers has decided to invest in Pakistan directly and in one of its favourite verticals globally : transportation . Naspers has been sceptical of investing in Pakistan stating that it is a risky business environment , however , with the effects of pandemic wearing off , Naspers has finally decided to set foot in Pakistan for the first time . <p> This is not to be confused with Naspers ' investment in OLX or the recent merger with the Emerging Markets Property Group ( EMPG ) .

So today , I am listing a few marketing tips you can learn from her . <h> Be a Visualiser <p> Careem 's campaign last year was aimed at attracting new captains and had the amazing slogan : ' Akele na jaana kamai chor kar ' . The slogan has a call to action and creates a powerful image in one 's mind . Brilliant . Another example is Ariel 's ' Share the Load ' campaign ; again a powerful call to action and a visual . Swift is a master storyteller and her lyrics create powerful imagery and one ca n't help but remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For example , in Story of Us she sings " I 've never heard silence this loud . " Take a leaf out of her book and create visual images in your TV and print ads and harness the audio-visual power of radio for impact . <h> Engage your Fans <p> Last year when Swift was about to release a new album , the music industry and her fans were very excited about it . How to keep millions of customers engaged and interested ? Swift did not reveal the album name but left hints in her videos and appearances and teased and challenged her fans to figure out the title for themselves . Once the album was launched , she hosted a special reveal show where she spoke to her fans and sang a song from the album for the first time . And yes , the event was live streamed . For her hit song The Man , she placed clues in the video to keep her fans guessing . <h> Use Figure and Ground <p> Swift created a masterpiece video for her single Style , using the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't rush to produce a music video ; instead remember the importance of figure and ground as it relates not only to visual but also to other information and stimulus . A brand that uses figure and ground very well is The Economist . They do this by deploying phrases and sayings we are already familiar but changing them slightly . For example ' Great minds like a think ' . This immediately clicked because the original phrase ' Great minds think alike ' is known to most of us -- similar to the Careem campaign I mentioned earlier . I am told that the Telefun jingle registered in people 's heads because the tune was the same as Ko Ko Korina . Let me know if you think that is true . <h> Think Different But Be Relevant <p> To stand out from the clutter a brand must at the same time remain true to its essence ; both do n't have to be opposites . Swift does this effortlessly as her music appeals not only to teenage girls but to a variety of people . How can she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her storytelling abilities and creative prowess but also chooses themes that are not the run of the mill . Her song The New Romantics talked powerfully about her generation , their hopes , fears and the lies they told themselves . Young people can relate to the song 's theme and older people , like myself , can admire the strength and wit on display in the lyrics as well as the catchy musical beats . A beautiful example of her thinking differently and being relevant is New Year 's Day . When we think of love , we often think of the romance of New Year 's Eve . But not Swift . She penned a song talking about the true essence of love , staying together when the party is over . As the lyrics say " I 'll be picking up bottles with you on New Year 's Day " . <p> Swift has become a world famous star , and good marketing and PR have played a role no doubt .

@@52006240 <h> Structural problems of Pakistan 's civil society <p> The writer is a graduate in Philosophy of Humanities from IIS London and a development practitioner in Pakistan . Email : email protected , Twitter : @ShakeelofHunza <p> In my previous article titled " On State and Civil Society " , I argued that a strong and vibrant civil society is necessary for development . Moreover , I pointed out that the gap between our civil society and our government is problematic as it does n't allow the former to grow and be a potential partner in the nation 's development . This article continues the discussion . The question that can set the premise for this article is whether the gap between the civil society and the government , and lack of seriousness on the part of the government is the only reason behind the not-so-active presence of civil society in Pakistan 's development context . <p> The answer is no . It is not the only problem . Before elaborating , it is necessary to have a glimpse of the civil society structure in Pakistan . A comprehensive research can be done to explain it . Put briefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is more than that . In Pakistan , the tribal associations , biradaris , and religious groups are also part of civil society . The reason for this is because of their functionality , these entities regulate the collective social life as intermediaries between the state and society . <p> The law , however , recognises NGOs as civil society . There is no particular legislative recognition of non-NGO formal and informal institutions and organisations as part of civil society . The absence of a legal recognition can be seen as beneficial as it sets these entities free to regulate themselves . But meanwhile it is alarming to see these entities so divided along many fault-lines . Some of the fractures exist along sectarian and ethnic lines . Researchers like Muhammad Qadeer and Iftikhar H Malik stated in the 1990s that the denominational interests of these entities have come to dominate the civil society arena . <p> This depicts a picture of scattered potential . Whereas these institutions and organisations bear a lot of potential in terms of critical mass , cultural norms and intellectual endeavours , their potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alleged to be played as pawns by the government to alter public attention from key issues . This is because of a lack of proper structure that should converge on the spectra of civil society . <p> A consortium of various civil society fora should exist where these civil society organisations come together to deliberate and agree on a broader civil society agenda . By doing so , they can create a momentum in favour of social development . Otherwise in the absence of a common platform to interact , random attempts to attain wide-scattered agendas leave the civil society dysfunctional . It 's probably why the government also seems not in a position to devise a policy related to civil society as there is no prevalent tangible structure of the civil society that can be dealt with as a unified whole . <p> By saying this , I do Rather a collective effort can be more effective than scattered efforts . Moreover , by coming closer to each onot mean that various denominations of civil society should relinquish the positive role they already play in highlighting key social issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their objectives . Also , through dialogue , these civil society organisations may be able to find common areas of interest and recommend suggestive paths for the government . <p> Formally , parliament can take the lead for this . By establishing a standing committee on civil society , parliament can help civil society organisations establish a consortium to interact , deliberate , discover key problems and devise action plans . By doing so , apart from elected representatives , parliament can have additional resources and direct input from civil society actors in legislation that is more responsive to public needs . This will empower civil society , eliminate structural problems within civil society and enable it to act more efficiently for the social well-being . This seems necessary to harness the scattered potential of civil society and make it more useful for the public good .

@@52231230 <h> How to be productive and stay active at home during lockdown ? <p> Coming back stronger than ever , the Coronavirus has made an unwelcome comeback this month . This wave has , yet again , halted our face-to-face education ... well , the institutes that were open anyway . <p> For those of us going back to Distanced Learning and taking online classes , we have to readjust to the lockdown life again : the mundaneact of staring at a computer screen for 7+ hours a day , the spine-crushing sitting on a chair from dusk till dawn , and the worst of them all , the eating our hearts out at home with little to no physical exertion to torch those calories . We 've all been there ; we 've all suffered through this with the first wave . The difference now is that we can be prepared . We can devise strategies . <h> How ? <p> There 's a simple art to staying at home all day . Master that , and you can make the most of these locked down conditions . First off , everyday within these conditions should be planned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allotted task that you achieve in it . It could be eating , sleeping , working , or even recreational activities like simply scrolling through social media . Planning it out on a piece of paper or on a phone calendar helps you visualise it better , making it easier for you to stick to it . <p> As with the pre-COVID normal days , we all need balance in our lives . Everything from sleeping to eating , studying , and exercise should come in moderation . These slots can overlap ; for example , with online classes , many a times you can eat and study together ! Whatever you do , however , should be in doses . <p> Lastly , what I 've particularly learned from the last lockdown , is that tracking does wonders for your routines . Track what you 've eaten , how much you 've worked , how much sleep you 're getting , what your screen-time is , and basically everything else . This helps you visualise how much you 've achieved in a day and then improve on yourself for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've given links to apps that I found useful during the last wave . <h> What ? <p> With lockdowns and self-quarantines , its important to list out a number of activities that you can , should , and want to do in a day . For example , if I were to make a basic list right now , it would include sleeping , eating , studying , working , exercise , and other recreational activities ( like sitting on my phone and scrolling through Instagram ) . I need to and should complete all these tasks in some way , shape , or form , by the end of my day . Now , I know this already sounds like too many things to do in twenty-four hours , but trust me , all these can be done with a little planning . <h> Sleeping <p> Let 's be honest , the thing that most of us do a lot more than usual during a locked down day is sleep . It could be because we get tired of studying or because all the other household activities tire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too accessible ; whenever we 're home , at any given moment , we can go into our rooms and just sleep . <p> My advice , or something that could and should work , is to get seven hours of sleep and get them early in the night ; the earlier the better . This works because the earlier you start the day , the more productive that day goes because there are more hours of daylight that you see and the day seems longer . <p> You can also sneak in a quick nap during the day but that should not last more than an hour . <p> A sleep tracking application that I have found to be quite effective is Sleepzy . It can be downloaded through your iOS or Android application stores . You can also track sleep on most health applications . <h> Studying <p> With studying , obviously , most of us have the day already planned for us . For those of us in schools and universities , we usually have a 7am-2pm , a 9am-5pm , or even a 5pm-9pm day ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot we can do to change that routine . However , if you have exams coming up or you 're simply trying to study more , this one can be given as much time as you need , provided the other activities do get their minimum share of your day as well . <h> Working <p> Working , for some , could be physically going in to work or it could be done online . Going in to work also has its fixed hours that , in most cases , can not be tampered with . Those of us who work from home can , however , choose to work at anytime we want . I always find that if I finish my classes and my work , all in one go , I can relax at the end of the day , knowing that I have finished my professional goals for the day . <p> For working , more important than What we do is How and Where we do it . Keep reading ahead to find out how those can be optimised to give you the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a simple routine , to-do list application would work with its tracking . This can also be done on your Calendar or Reminders app . <h> Eating <p> If we 've learned anything from the past lockdown ( for those of us still living with our parents ) is that our moms ( or dads ) make the most amazing food ... and that we can eat more than we once thought we could ! <p> These eating habits , without a proper exercise routine , can be very dangerous to your health . They can lead to obesity which , in turn , leads to heart diseases , diabetes , and a world of other health complications . It is therefore very important to have a balanced diet : eat a little bit from each food group , stay away from too many sweets and carbs , focus more on fruits and vegetables , and burn away the calories if you do eat more than the normal amount in a day . <p> The best tracking application I have found for counting my calories is an application called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Store as well as the Google Play Store . Lose It ! Is a simply calorie tracking application which can record what foods you eat in a day , give an estimate of how many calories they would be , and subtract calories by tracking exercise sessions as well . <h> Exercise <p> Exercise was either the most forgotten thing during the previous lockdown , or the most focused . There was no in between . Finding the right balance and burning off the extra calories from sitting all day is important to avoid many health complications . What I have found to be most effective and useful has been the sticking to a well-structured YouTube video , specific to your needs ; and keeping it consistent throughout the week . A cardio-strength balance also needs to be considered . Strength training can , in the long run , help with speeding up your metabolism and helping you lose , or maintain weight ; a small amount of muscle also weighs more than the same amount of fat so gaining muscles can also help with gaining weight . <p> Desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active . The University of New Hampshire suggests turning off your camera , and doing squats , push-ups , or jumping jacks whilst taking classes . Tiny Pulse has also suggested some desk exercises for you to check out during the next class that you have ! <p> Lose It ! also helps with tracking various exercises and how many calories they torch . Other applications include 7-minute workout applications , and the YouTube app ( you can find anything on YouTube ) . <h> Social Media <p> This deserves to be a whole different category because , in my opinion , whether we like it or not , our generation relaxes on the internet . It 's how we keep in touch with each other and how we keep in touch with the rest of the world . It 's how we laugh and blow off steam . Something that relaxes your mind and eases your thoughts in a hectic day should be given importance and time . It should , therefore , also be given a slot in your timetable . <p> However , an excess of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyesight and your thought process , it will also waste a lot of your time . To fight against that , applications like Instagram have limits that you can put in ; the app then gives you a notification after you 've been on it for a specific amount of time in a day . iPhones in general can have screen time notifications set up in them to warn their users of when they 've used their phones for more than a predefined amount of time . <h> Where ? <p> With lockdown conditions , even if you are , by law , allowed to go outside , you should go when necessary . All the things mentioned above can be done from within the quarters of your house . Going to the gym to exercise , out to restaurants to eat , and to educational institutes to study can be a risk to your health as well as the health of your loved ones at home . So , stay at home and stay safe ! <p> Within your house , you can allot specific areas to specifc tasks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more if I have a specified studying/working place . This area should mainly not be used for anything else . Exercising can be done almost anywhere you can fit a yoga mat . Desk exercises and standing exercises can also be done where you study.Sleeping can be done anywhere you find comfortable ! <p> So , there it is ! This articles focuses on the six most important and general things that almost everyone has to do everyday . You can always add to the list and make it your own . The three things that should stay the same , however , are tracking , consistency , and balance ; track what you do , do it consistently , and find the right balance when allotting time to each activity . <p> All of these ways and these applications will simply help you in achieving your lockdown goals . I 'm going to be honest ; you 'll have to put in the effort yourself . You will have to fix your sleeping schedule , eat healthy and nutritious foods , work and study an appropriate amount , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on trying and hope that with each passing day you get more active and productive within the premises of your home ; I know I am . <p> TechJuice for Browser : Get breaking news notifications on your browser.
