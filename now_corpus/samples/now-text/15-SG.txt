Excessive exposure to UV rays raises the risk of skin cancer and cause cataracts . <p> The excess depletion of ozone was caused by gases called chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs .

@@2109236 <h> Misunderstood " facts " about property agents in Singapore <p> No , I do n't make S$1.5m from one property sale ... and other misunderstood facts about being a property agent in Singapore <p> By CY Low , BelowVal <p> Recently , a real estate agent became an overnight millionaire after completing the sale of a penthouse at a freehold condominium at a record price of S$51 million . Of course , this has definitely led many people to think that being a real estate agent is highly lucrative job . <p> Actually , the truth is much uglier than what most have imagined . This article aims to dispel this myth and many other misunderstood facts about being in this line of work . <p> 1 . Myth : I think real estate agents earn a lot , so much so , that they become instant millionaires <p> Fact : Real estate agents do n't have a regular income , but only earn commissions from sales or rentals . <p> There is no actual benchmark of a real estate agent 's salary . How much an agent earns depends a lot on factors that affect the property market , e.g. the market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws and measures on the property market . <p> A real estate agent earns via commission , which is calculated as a percentage of a property sale , typically 1-2% , or 1 month for every 24 months of rental amount , in the case where he or she helps to rent out a property . <p> Therefore , the wages of a real estate agent are highly volatile . There could be months where an agent earns only a 3-figure sum , and there are also months where an agent might earns a hefty 5-figure amount . <p> Fact : Real agents do not have it easy ; sometimes they need to run errands for their clients . <p> Working in this service-oriented line , and with competition from so many other agents , it 's difficult for a real estate agent to stand out in the industry . Indeed , there are agents who are able to find potential clients only by word-of mouth marketing , but often , property agents have to go the extra mile in order to secure property deals . <p> Unlike 10 or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show their sincerity to clients . The agent who made the news for clinching a S$1.5 million property deal said in a newspaper report that she even has to run errands for her clients , and also pick them up and drop them off wherever they want to go . This goes to show that an agent has to prove that he or she is worth their salt , before they can successfully close a deal . <p> 3 . Myth : The real estate agent does not have to do a lot of marketing to secure a deal <p> Fact : It 's the exact opposite . Agents must now employ many creative marketing strategies . <p> Effective and clever marketing helps get the word out that there is a property for sale or for rent . Conventional marketing methods via newspaper advertisement , brochures , and flyers , while useful to a certain extent , are often costly . Usually , it is the agent who has to fork out the money to engage such advertising media ; hence some monetary sacrifices are needed before a deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Internet , agents can now post their listings online . While being very affordable , listings by an agent often get ' lost ' among other listings by numerous other agents . <p> On top of it all , property owners typically engage several real estate agents to assist in the sale/rent of their property . Hence , competition is very tense among these agents to clinch the deal . To stand out among others , an agent has to be creative or spend more with his or her marketing of the property . <p> 4 . Myth : I do n't have to be accredited to be a real estate agent . <p> Fact : Accreditation is now compulsory . <p> It is a legal regulation that agents must be certified and regulated by the Council for Estate Agencies , where they are required to pass the Real Estate Salesperson ( RES ) examination . <p> Real estate agents must also renew their license to remain accredited . The threshold to enter the industry has been raised , and aspiring agent-to-be have to work way much harder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this line as a true real estate agent . <p> Conclusion <p> There truly lies the opportunity to earn a higher-than-average living as a real estate agent . However , one must understand that insanely high-income earners are the exception more than the norm , and a lot of work goes on behind-the-scenes of a property deal . There is increased competition in the property industry nowadays , and to really survive , real estate agents must be prepared to go out of the way for their clients , get accredited , and be creative . <h> Subscribe to Blog via Email <p> Enter your email to subscribe and receive notifications of new posts by email . <p> Email Address <h> About Us <p> The Online Citizen is Singapore 's longest-running independent online media platform .

While a number of Kickstarter campaigns focus on empowering your bags to charge your devices , relatively minor things like locks are also getting a makeover . <p> The Australian startup AirBolt is pushing its new Bluetooth-enabled , remotely-controlled lock on Kickstarter . Built with the forgetful traveller in mind , you can open your lock with the touch of an app instead of a standard combination . The lock will retail for AUD$79.95 or US$59.95 , but is available for AUD$55 ( about US$39 ) during the Kickstarter campaign , which launched recently . <p> For the paranoid among us , the company has more sophisticated ways of keeping your stuff locked . And just like other smart luggage companies , it keeps track of the distance between you and the lock to make sure you know where it is or can report its theft immediately . <p> The company is the brainchild of Founder and CEO Kabir Sidhu . Responding to our questions , Sidhu said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developers to give it more capability . <p> " The AirBolt will have certain libraries open for developers to build and expand on its base feature set . So if you want , you can unlock your AirBolt using your voice , " Sidhu told Geektime . <p> The team stresses accessibility and affordability : It works with most zipper sizes and is far cheaper than buying an entire smart luggage package . The lock has already cleared TSA approval , meaning that the TSA can not simply break your lock for inspection ( outside of , say , a security situation ) . If the NSA does go in , the lock will log every time it is opened so you know immediately if your bag caught their eye . <p> " The idea came after a bad experience with an expensive TSA-approved travel lock that would n't open for me , " Sidhu said in a press release . " Somehow the combination on it changed when the lock got knocked around and I had no way of cutting open the lock easily . I began thinking that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your luggage . There is no reason why a travel lock should n't be able to capitalise on today 's technologies to make travelling with luggage a little more stress-free , " he added . <h> Melbourne 's startup ecosystem needs maturing <p> It 's the story of a small Australian company with six employees ( seven if you include Chief Visionary Officer and probably team mascot Popcorn the dog ) that hopes to bypass the high cost of smart luggage . While AirBolt is n't offering a luggage set with hidden power packs and USB chargers , it might be hitting on a more important consumer concern : security . The company is entirely self-funded , though that could change if the Kickstarter campaign takes off . <p> " I personally , until now worked on AirBolt at night and another full-time job during the day in order to ensure there was enough funding for the design and development of the product , " Sidhu relayed to us . " Other funds have been obtained via investments which I have sold in order to ensure there is enough capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of a town that is awash in talent but with limited resources . The Melbourne startup ecosystem is the second largest in Australia , though still far behind the Sydney scene , according to a report by Deloitte .

" Over time , we hope that more startups and innovation continue to foster in Australia and we 'd love to be able to drive innovation at AirBolt as well .

Companies like Bluesmart , Trunkster , Barracuda and Travel-Light and its G-RO smart luggage provide variations of security and geolocation technology , though for a bigger price tag . <p> That range also applies to security and accessibility . Only the owner 's phone can open the lock and only if it is within a specified range of the bag . The company anticipates you might lend out the lock , so it opens access to an exclusive list of people and if you are lending the lock , you can change the settings to open it from abroad . Another combo forces the owner to open it simultaneously with their app while holding the lock 's release button . There is also an optional passcode that can be entered by click pattern on the device itself . <p> The lock is designed to have an eternal shelf life . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should last 500 charge cycles . The company was n't able to offer a real shelf life when we asked .

Adding all these features and electronics should n't impact durability , " Sidhu noted . <p> The lock still has awhile to go before it reaches the palm of your hand . It wo n't reach customers until August 2016 , so AirBolt is putting in the last minute touches now before its campaign conceivably takes off : It has a ways to go in reaching its AUD$50,000 goal .

@@2111236 <h> Early Bird <h> Early Bird <p> I am now 84 years old and I have been teaching since the age of 28 . I have lectured in out-of-the-way colleges in India , by choice , so as to get to know the distant parts of the country . <p> I have also lectured in the best universities elsewhere . Last week , I gave a lecture in a college in Bombay . For the first time in my life , the police rang me before the lecture and insisted on giving me police protection . <p> The fear was that certain elements , part of the coalition BJP government , might throw ink or worse , on me . The police were very civil but very firm about protecting me . <p> I was deeply touched by this gesture of giving me protection , but at the same time it left me feeling equally depressed that after 68 years of independence , it was not possible for an academic to give an academic lecture on the subject of secularism , without needing police protection . <p> What have we reduced ourselves to as a nation and as a society . Is this something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us who have raised the issue of the increasing violence and intolerance , are being taunted by the party in power . <h> It is referred to as a ' manufactured rebellion ' <p> To manufacture is to make by hand and what is thus made , exists and is tangible . This protest was not suddenly ballooned up . It is the spontaneous anguish of many Indians who do not like the way in which our society and values are currently being mangled . <p> The protest has been registered all over the country , and continues to be so , by people in various professions - and not just by so-called lefties , but by business tycoons and the governor of the Reserve Bank . <p> These latter are not the kind of people who by any stretch of the imagination can be called " rabidly anti-BJP " , as Jaitley describes those who are protesting . <p> So why does n't the government ask them why they are also referring to the present times as a deeply disturbed civil society . <h> To call it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebellion is a movement against the existence of the state . We are not demanding the removal of the state . <p> We are demanding that there be a proper governance to end the murder and mayhem that has overtaken Indian society . <p> We are making our request to the President of India , who is the head of the state . <h> So what am I and many others protesting about ? <p> We are objecting to a situation in our society where books are banned ; where senior members of the BJP ask for the burning of books , such as mine ; by the inking of faces of people who want to debate issues of foreign policy ; by the assassination of rational thinkers ; by the lynching of people rumoured to have expressed the right to eat what they want ; by the explaining away of the daily rape of women because the mindset of men in power can not come to terms with the idea of a liberated woman ; and by Dalits being brutally killed because they dare to aspire to a better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not new . <p> In the past there have been sporadic acts , and each time many of us protested and they have been dismissed as problems of law and order alone . <p> In the past year , however , there has been a striking increase in such acts . The terror , the atmosphere of fear , violence and acute disharmony is the activity of the under-belly of the Sangh Parivar , whom we all call fringe elements . <p> It is no longer only a law-and-order problem . The attempt is to control society and especially those threatened , by instilling fear in everyone . <h> The question of which party is in power in a particular state is irrelevant . <p> All this happens because governance has declined . This decline , not unknown in the recent past , is now only too evident . <p> The fringe elements are calling the shots . One is asking , who has the power and the authority to stop such crimes or will the general silence continue ? Surely , a central government can complain effectively to state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements in its own party . <h> Accusations <p> Accusations are made against us as protestors that we never protested in the past ; that we have only protested against the RSS and their version of the Hindu Rashtra and the Hindu religion , and not against others and that we are rabidly anti-BJP . <p> May I take this opportunity to mention the litany of the occasions and incidents that I have protested against ? And this goes not just for me but for most of us . <p> I protested against the Emergency in 1975 and was harangued by the government of Mrs Gandhi , whom I did not support even though I admired Nehru . <p> I protested against the genocide of the Sikhs in 1984 and supported the efforts of those enquiring into it . <p> I objected to the fatwa against Salman Rushdie . <p> I protested against the so-called history of the Ram Janmabhumi and the destruction of the Babri Masjid , about which some of us even wrote a book - The Anatomy of a Confrontation - but the media and the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protested together with a large number of historians , against the Communist Party ( Marxist ) and their actions in Nandigram . <p> In 2005 when UPA -I was in power , a number of us protested against professional bodies like councils , institutes and academies still remaining under the control of the government . We demanded that they should be made autonomous bodies run by professionals without government appointees to control the votes . <p> And more recently I protested against the fatwa condemning AR Rahman . <p> I seem to have spent my life in writing heavy tomes on history and actively protesting against the curtailing of the freedom of speech and human rights . <p> And yet I am described as someone who never protested . <p> Why do n't the BJP , the RSS and the media do some little homework on the people whom they rush to accuse of being prejudiced . When the media and political parties tell such blatant lies about people , one loses all respect for them . <h> Returning of awards <p> The latest media report states that I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the joke is that I have never accepted awards from the government , so I have nothing to return . <p> But on this question let 's clarify one thing that is being made much of . Are these state awards , or government awards ? <p> I would like to say categorically that to my way of thinking , they are government awards . That is why I have twice declined Padma awards from Congress governments . <p> One can tell from the list of awardees every year as to which political party is in power . They can only be treated as state awards if the Home Ministry and the specialized ministries are not involved in the selection of awardees . <p> So the question of insulting the nation by returning the awards does not arise . <h> What is the protest about <p> In its inability to control its mobs , the only come back that the BJP has is to describe the protestors as Leftists or instigated by the Congress party . Many are Leftists but many are not . <p> What the protest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discuss the issues that face us as a society and how we can remove the current fear . <p> Why should Perumal Murugan have to forswear ever writing another novel just because the Hindu Munani will not allow him to do so ? <p> We were promised the utopia of development in the 2014 election , but is this what was meant by development ? <p> Have we got any further with this ? We blamed the previous UPA government for doing too little but we are also at a standstill with this government . <p> And then we are cynically told that civil society should be giving its attention to the poverty in the country . If civil society could remove the poverty of this country then why would we need governance ? <h> Shouting down <p> The media claims to be debating the subjects of imminent importance . <p> For every subject there are political party spokespersons , often for no apparent reason except habit . <p> They shout at each other so loudly and deafeningly and interrupt each other with such frequency that they are as good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disrespect by the political spokesperson towards the eminent scientist Prof. PM Bhargava . <p> The latter was making the interesting point that a number of scientists who have recently protested , have spoken up in defense of rational thinking and the need for a scientific temper , and that many of these scientists are respected heads of scientific institutions . <p> Prof. Bhargava 's remarks were rudely shouted down . If politicians do not have the civility to debate an issue without being rude and crass , it might be more to the point to exclude them from media debates . <p> Even the anchors seem now to be losing control over them . Are these then the new middle-class manners and values ? <p> Indian civilization once gave priority to respecting opposing views in the course of a debate , however much one may have disagreed with such views . <p> The culture of anti-intellectualism is busy manufacturing public opinion based on these dubious values . <p> I was amused to read that the RSS is accusing the protesting intellectuals of intolerance , because they do not agree with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Does this mean that the intellectual must conform to just the one ideology put out by the RSS ? <p> Debate does require a civil dialogue . Given that the followers of the RSS seem to believe that they must spit venomous abuse at those that disagree with its ideology , there can be no dialogue . <h> What can the government do <p> But if there is to be a wider dialogue then inevitably one has to ask what can the central government do to clear this mess ? <p> It can cleanse itself by disassociating the government with those in the party that make or insinuate hate speeches and indulge in acts of violence and terror . <p> It can return to its agenda of trying to bring in development without justifying the activities of the under-belly of the party - the so-called fringe elements . <p> This means postponing smart cities and bullet trains and focusing on the essentials of human needs , so desperately requiring priority . <p> It can make professional bodies autonomous and answerable to peers and professionals for their actions , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intellectual quality of such institutions . <p> The bonafides of the government might improve if there was extensive consultation and participation in governance by those qualified to do so , and not just by selected members of the political party .

These include shipbrokers , cargo inspectors and insurers , but it is the ship 's agent who is the party responsible for coordinating all physical in-port operations , from both a cargo- handling standpoint ( arranging berth and all navigational support services such as Pilots , tugboats and mooring gangs ) as well as from a ship-husbandry perspective ( supplying the stores , water , repairs , crew medical needs , repatriations etc for the ship 's owners ) .

Around us we see competitors whose service levels often lack substance .

@@3066240 <p> Forrester Research has unveiled its top 10 technology predictions for Asia Pacific in 2015 , with expectations that mobile-powered customer experiences will fuel digital transformation in the region . <p> " In a world of ever increasing digital demands and shrinking budgets , CIOs need to be smarter with where they place their bets , " said Dane Anderson , Forrester Research 's vice-president , research director and region manager for Asia Pacific .

" <p> In this guest post that first appeared on LinkedIn , Woei Hern Chan , a former Naga DDB creative director who is nine months into his role as ECD of IPG Mediabrands Malaysia 's creative arm Ensemble , reveals what life is like as a creative in a media agency . <p> When I first announced that I was joining IPG Mediabrands , responses from peers to colleagues to friends were varied . Some said I had ' cashed-out ' on the creative industry , deciding to graze in the laid-back pastures of media-led creative output . <p> In this Q&amp;A with Mumbrella Asia 's editor Robin Hicks , the news and current affairs title 's chief marketing officer Michael Brunt talks about how The Economist brand is perceived in Asia , how digital is sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budge on ratecard . <p> So what 's the plan to grow in Asia this year ? <p> Asia is incredibly important for us because of the way we classify our audience . We use a combination of psychographic and demographic data to evaluate our readers . People who read The Economist have more in common with people in their own psychographic group globally than they do with most of their fellow country folk . The most overriding consistent psychographic characteristic is that they 're interested in the world beyond their own borders . They 're also keen on their own careers , they 're quite techie , and they 're more likely than most to be a volunteer . <p> Michael Brunt <p> Demographically , they 're in the upper quartiles for education and are earning good money -- or will end up doing so . There are around 130 million people we think ought to be reading The Economist globally . But -- and this is a big but -- not all of these people would have the command of English that would make the experience of reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd have about 70 million potential readers . <p> Asia is a huge area of potential . But it is not our largest region for penetration . Australia , Hong Kong and Singapore index more highly , but generally penetration is relatively low in Asia . <p> We have put a lot of marketing investment into Asia over the last year , and we 're increasing it this year too . <p> The Economist 's audited circulation figures <p> A key factor in our growth comes from our pricing strategy . You can make a saving by buying a subscription of the magazine from our website , but we charge less for the digital versions . If you want both , you pay a 20 per cent premium . <p> We might charge a bit less for digital , but most of our new subscribers choose both . We have more than doubled our digital audience in a year , and fewer and fewer people are choosing only the print edition ; two thirds of our new subscribers choose something digital . <p> For me , that 's great news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The Economist 's worldwide print and digital circulation increased by one per cent year on year , we 're increasingly our profitability . <p> We are confident in our strategy . We do n't see a diminishing demand for what we sell , and we continue to see a very good response from our marketing . <p> Tell us a bit about your marketing strategy for Asia . <p> We spend a lot of money on digital , and different marketing teams take responsibility for a section of the customer journey . Right at the top of the funnel it 's about prospecting and growing awareness through social and PR , owned and earned media . As a publisher , we have a lot of content , and we use a lot of it in our marketing . We look at what people are reading , and place contextual ads to reach them -- and we get good click-through rates . People say you 're more likely to be struck by lightening than click on a banner ad , but we do n't see that . <p> We move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point where they are considering buying a subscription . And it 's all database driven . We 're not an easy read , and the best way to sell The Economist is through sampling . <p> What do you expect most from your agencies ? <p> We select those that give us the expertise we do n't have internally , and with a know-how across a range of clients . We have brought in a retail marketing specialist , as we take the view that our marketing should never go dark . Our marketing approach is either global or local . We 're more likely to have a strategy for , say , Hong Kong or Melbourne than for Asia . <p> So the days of the big white-on-red billboards are over ? <p> The Economist on a Hong Kong taxi side <p> The days where the majority of our brand marketing budget is spent on high-impact outdoor are gone . We do some -- in Sydney , Melbourne and Hong Kong -- and we 're prevalent on the sides of taxi sides . Previously , we did a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really important to gain reach , but now it 's more of a mixture . <p> So this year , what 's the focus of your marketing efforts ? <p> Every year we update a five-year plan . This year is about growing the profitability of our circulation . Before we sell an ad , we need to make a profit from our circulation . It 's important for editorial to know that we are covering our costs . <p> When we launched the app in 2010 , we thought migration to digital would be swift and irreversible . Which is only partly true . It 's been far slower than we thought it would be . We did n't think print would go away . But we were genuinely surprised that over half of new subscribers now choose the print and digital bundle . <p> Which is more profitable for The Economist , print or online ? <p> The Economist Espresso <p> I look at profitability independently of ad revenue . The way we price our products means that we can be agnostic about format . With advertising , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we 've seen a structural decline in print advertising revenue . <p> If you buy a print ad , it wo n't run automatically online as a PDF . That might be seen as a risky strategy . But now it is benefiting us as we 've built a digital-only revenue stream . This is growing quickly , and demand is high for our native advertising offering . <p> But as a whole business , it 's not growing fast enough to mitigate the decline in print ad revenues . Meanwhile circulation is growing in profitability but not in total volume . <p> In the UK , The Economist is a media institution . How do you feel it is perceived in Asia as a brand ? <p> We 're definitely not an institution in Asia . In international finance hubs , yes -- we 're very well established . But beyond the financial centres , we have to fight to introduce people to The Economist . We want to keep The Economist front of mind with outdoor , experiential marketing and followed up with a lot of digital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make The Economist more appealing in Asia 's more price sensitive markets ? <p> This is not the solution we 're running with . But we 're aware that The Economist is very expensive . Which is why we introduced The Economist Espresso a curated digital wrap of key events , which is a lower price point and has been doing very well in markets such as India , Nigeria and Kenya . So our solution is not to discount -- to borrow from a very British expression , we do n't want to discount the crown jewels . Our solution is to introduce new products that are slightly cheaper .

Virulence factors are bacterial proteins such as toxins or degrading enzymes that act as weapons to cause disease .

Equities , Treasuries and commodities will be on the move but the market to trade will be currencies . In this day and age , we ca n't just focus on U.S. developments particularly in a week when there are 3 monetary policy announcements , employment reports from 2 countries besides the U.S. and a number of PMI reports on the calendar . Greece also has a EUR 300 million payment due to the IMF on Friday . Each one of these event risks could take the focus off the dollar but collectively it assures an active and volatile week for currencies . <p> The 5 most important event risks to watch in order of release will be tonight 's Reserve Bank of Australia monetary policy announcement , Wednesday 's ECB rate decision , the 300 million euro payment by Greece to the IMF on Friday along with the U.S. and Canadian employment reports .

In the past 2 weeks , USD/JPY raced from 119 to a high just shy of 125 on the back of mixed U.S. economic reports . This morning we learned that while personal incomes grew 0.4% in the month of April , personal spending and the PCE deflator was flat . Manufacturing activity on the other hand grew at a faster pace with prices spiking and constructing spending accelerating . Dollar bulls chose to shrug off the soft earlier report to take USD/JPY to its highest level since 2002 .

However there is significant resistance between 1.26 and 1.2650 that could be difficult to break before the IVEY PMI and employment reports . Meanwhile in the next 36 hours the focus will be on the Australian dollar . The RBA meets to discuss monetary policy and based upon the latest economic reports and the current level of AUD , there is very little reason for the central bank to push for a rate cut .

There 's talk that an agreement will be made tonight but we 've been down this road many times before and we are extremely skeptical of their ability to find a common ground outside of their desire to see Greece who owes more than 1.5 billion euros to the IMF this month avoid default . A deal of some sort has to be made and when the announcement comes it will be extremely positive for the euro even if it proves to be only a stop gap measure . However between now and then , market skepticism and conflicting headlines should keep EUR/USD under pressure . Creditors have until the end of the month to work out a deal and they may opt to take their time in the hopes that they could strong arm Greece into real reforms .

In the last 2 weeks the currency pair gave up nearly half of those losses to trade as low as 1.5170 intraday . What is amazing about the move in the pound is its persistence .

These routine practices make it difficult for us to conceptualize the magnitude of food wastage on a global scale and the problem is bigger than we think ! <p> A report by United Nations Environment Programs ( UNEP ) and the world resources institute ( WRI ) shows that about 1/3rd of all food produced worldwide , worth around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and consumption systems .

Not only that- the carbon footprint due to food wastage is estimated at 3.3 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent of Green House Gases released into the atmosphere per year . <p> Food production and supply management has a large carbon footprint . Right from the production of fertilizers and pesticides for agriculture , to growing of food crops and transportation of the food to the markets , and the wasted food which gets incinerated or goes into landfills- all of these are significant processes that emit greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane . <p> The total volume of water used each year to produce food that is lost or wasted ( 250km3 ) is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or three times the volume of Lake Geneva . <p> 1.4 billion hectares of land -- 28 percent of the world 's agricultural area -- is used annually to produce food that is lost or wasted . <p> Agriculture is responsible for a majority of threats to at-risk plant and animal species tracked by the International Union for Conservation of Nature . <p> The direct economic consequences of food wastage ( excluding fish and seafood ) run to the tune of $750 billion annually . <p> Remember these facts next time , when you waste that small portion of pasta -- which was too big a portion for you to begin with ! What can we do as consumers ?

He then went on to predict an extension of that remarkable sequence , believing his side would beat Jimmy Armfield 's Leeds United " 2-0 or 2-1 " . <p> But as Leeds tore the German side to shreds in the opening minutes of the match at the Parc des Princes , it looked highly likely that Yorkshire pluck rather than German luck was going to hold sway . By the end of the night , however , with Maier doubtless wearing a smug ' told you so ' grin , it was Leeds , rather than Bayern , who were left to face not just gut-wrenching disappointment but also the full fury of UEFA 's ire . <p> Domestic mist <p> " <p> That team was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have lost every match in the league but still made it to the final <p> - Phil Beeton <p> Had Leeds won that final , it would have been the crowning glory of an era dominated by the omnipresent figure of Don Revie .

" This is the big one , " he wrote . And he was n't wrong . After a gruelling campaign in Europe and disappointing one on the home front -- Leeds finished ninth after a dismal start to the season under the soon-to-depart Brian Clough -- the match in Paris offered this ageing side one final shot at writing their name into folklore . <p> Revie may have gone but the spine of the greatest Leeds United side in history was still very much in place .

Armfield 's side were out to ensure that did n't happen . <p> " That team was determined to win that cup for Revie ; they could have lost every match in the league but still made it to the final , that 's how much it meant to them , " says Phil Beeton , secretary of the Leeds United Supporters ' Club , and one of the thousands who poured across the Channel in anticipation of a famous success 40 years ago .

Yorath -- mercifully , for the army of Leeds fans packed into the stands -- was spared a red card . That may have been a stroke of luck , but it would be the final break afforded to Armfield 's men .

" Jupp Kapellmann broke to the right and there was Muller , quick as a cobra on the half turn , to slip in the cross like lightning , " wrote Green . As the clock ran down , Bayern 's jubilant fans celebrated . Their Leeds counterparts , however , had other things on their mind . <p> " I was in the corner away from it all but it did n't look nice , " Beeton says .

" It can not go on like this , " said one senior figure .

@@3362237 <h> Plane orders do n't fly at the 2015 Paris Airshow <p> PARIS - The boom in commercial plane orders of recent years appears to be giving way to a more sustainable pace of demand at the 2015 Paris air show , with jetmakers increasingly focused on lifting production to meet their record backlog of sales . <p> US planemaker Boeing and European rival Airbus unveiled a steady stream of deals on Tuesday , day two of the aerospace industry 's main annual gathering . <p> Boeing announced the biggest firm order of the event so far , with Dutch aircraft leasing company AerCap buying 100 737 MAX 8 jets in a deal worth US$10.7 billion ( S$14.4 billion ) at list prices , confirming a Reuters report . <p> Korean Airlines split a US$6.9 billion deal for 60 narrow-body jets between Boeing and Airbus , also confirming what sources close to the matter had told Reuters . <p> However , the number and size of the deals to date is below that of many recent trade shows , when cheap borrowing costs and strong growth in passenger numbers encouraged airlines to splash out on new , more fuel-efficient planes . <p> " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aerospace and defence analyst at UK 's Agency Partners . <p> " There are fewer orders this week than there have been at any air show in recent years .

Airbus raised its 20-year forecast for jet sales on Monday , citing the rapid expansion of airlines in Asia and the Middle East and echoing a similarly upbeat outlook from Boeing last week . <p> The biggest challenge facing planemakers now is to ramp up production to meet the record US$1.8 trillion of orders they have booked for the coming decade . <p> Boeing is already planning to increase output of its popular 737 narrow-body jet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Its commercial airplanes chief , Ray Conner , said on Tuesday the company would be cautious about taking any decision to raise production towards 60 a month - a level mooted as possible for both Airbus and Boeing . <p> PRUDENT ON PRODUCTION <p> " We are going to be very prudent in how we approach any rates above 52 .

" <p> Conner also issued a warning to Airbus following reports the European group might apply for government loans to develop a revamped version of its A380 superjumbo . <p> " Whether they go forward with that , we will address as it comes along .

There is also a major shift in the types of products that consumers own . <p> The Consumer Electronics Association found that globally , smartphones are now the third most-owned consumer electronic product , trailing televisions and DVD/Blu-ray players . Smartphones moved from the fifth position in 2014 to the third position , switching places with digital cameras . In the next few years , we will see the launch of new innovations that provide increased convenience , as well as a more immersive experience . <h> How about in Asia ? Are there trends that are unique to this region ? <p> In Asia , in particular , smartphone penetration rates are among the highest in the world . According to Google 's 2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ globally , measuring at 85 per cent , with other Asian countries such as China and Japan ranking high on the list , measuring at 70 per cent and 46 per cent respectively . <p> With the bulk of Asians accessing the Internet via their smartphones , Asia is poised to be the next hotspot for mobile innovation . Mobile chat apps such as Kakao Talk , Line and WeChat have become increasingly popular in Asia with their mobile-friendly and personal approach . In an increasingly global market , CEA recognises the important role that foreign companies , especially those in Asia , play in the growth and vibrancy of the consumer electronics industry . <h> What does CEA hope to achieve by bringing CES here ? <p> We do not envision CES Asia as an Asian version of CES . Rather , we have always believed that Asia , as a region , plays and will continue to play an important role in consumer electronics trends and adoption of new technologies . <p> CES Asia is designed for products making their world debut in the Asian marketplace . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to complement each other . Throughout CES Asia , attendees saw a wider array of companies and products that are created , developed and sold in the Asian market . The show also armed local retailers with best practices for selling and showcasing new technologies . <h> Why organise it in Shanghai instead of Singapore , Taiwan or Tokyo ? <p> Initial seedlings for CES Asia were sown about five years ago , and since then we have regularly been meeting with our members and potential exhibitors to determine what their needs are for a show like this and to see how we could ultimately meet those needs . <p> First , is there a need for a CES style event in Asia ? The answer was yes , so next , where should we host and when ? Five years and more than 100 meetings later our research has shown that yes , there is indeed a need for CES in Asia and that Shanghai should be selected because it represents the future . <p> Research has shown that the demand for consumer electronics in the Asia Pacific market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future due to increasing domestic demand from countries such as India and China . <h> What trends and verticals are under the radar ? What do we need to look at ? <p> As mentioned earlier , smartphones are very much taking Asia by storm . With increasing smartphone penetration in Asia , the economic implications of m-commerce have become very real . Several of Asia 's home-grown chat apps , recognising the potential of online-to-offline ( O2O ) commerce , have sought to create an avenue for fans to check out a brand , validate an item and complete the purchase by making a payment seamlessly via their mobile phones . <p> Retailers now not only have to worry about e-retailers , but also the rise of m-retailers -- retailers who sell their wares via the user-friendly interface of the mobile phone . Individuals can also buy and sell their personal items consumer-to-consumer via chat apps such as e-commerce platform Line Mall , as well as through applications such as Carousell . Brands are just beginning to unlock the potential of m-commerce and m-payments . <p> As Asians continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more traditional methods , m-payments and m-commerce could become more integrated with everyday consumer electronics . <h> With the Internet of Things ( IoT ) a buzzword among tech companies , what direction does the CEA see the IoT market heading towards ? <p> Consumers can expect an increase in the number of ' smart ' devices entering the market . Asian brands , such as Samsung and Xiaomi , are already in the business of manufacturing ' smarter ' devices , such as lights that allow users to dim using their smartphones . According to Gartner , some 4.9 billion things will be connected to the Internet by the end of 2015 , with that figure expected to soar to 25 billion by 2020 . <p> Wearables will contribute towards the expected 25 billion number . Some of the most popular wearables to hit the market today include fitness trackers and smartwatches , both of which are commonly paired with smartphones . <p> Automobile brands are also developing technologies that allow for an increased amount of automation within the vehicle , with such technologies poised to make driving safer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drivers ' eyes and sound off an alert if the driver becomes distracted . Additionally , there have been developments by various brands aimed at reducing the amount of energy consumed by cars during each drive . <h> Is there too much hype over IoT though ? <p> The Internet of Things ( IoT ) has gotten a lot of attention , but rightfully so due to both its seamless ability to connect consumers and also for the complex issues surrounding the technology . One issue that needs to be dealt with is personal privacy . An increase in the number of devices connected to the Internet will result in an explosion in the amount of data collected by corporations . <p> Not only do corporations have to think about ways to store this data , they need to have measures in place to ensure the information collected by such devices respect the privacy of users . Security and flexibility are two other issues . Smart technologies need to be designed so that the products can not be breached and the information collected by the devices can not be utilised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Due to the varying needs of users , devices should offer some levels of customisation . The current laws in most regions have not caught up with technological advancements . <h> What are some of the challenges facing Western consumer tech companies in coming to APAC ? <p> Asia is a very diverse region . Different parts of Asia are developing or have developed at different rates when it comes to technology adoption , so it is difficult to define the rate of development . What is definite , though , is that demand for technology innovation is growing in Asia . <p> One of the first challenges that brands looking to expand in APAC face is the lack of a ' one-size fits all ' approach . Brands not only need to consider the different working languages , styles and local laws , but also need to consider the different levels of development , consumer demands and standards of living .

Now , the organisation has decided to open its first overseas office in Singapore . <p> Peter Draper , who is the newly appointed commercial and marketing director of Valencia said the office presence is to target both Asian fans and brands . Draper , who has a wealth of experience in marketing sports clubs and sports brands , is most famously known for his stint as group marketing director at Manchester United . <p> In a conversation with Marketing , Draper explained that the goal of the club at this point is relatively simple . <p> " We want to be a sustainable football club . Just because we have a wealthy owner does n't mean he can spend on us continuously . We need to find our own way in the football world and find our own business model and our own voice , " Draper said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objective of the office would be to build the relationship the club has with local sports clubs with federations around the region . <p> Leading a challenger brand <p> A passionate football fanatic at heart , Draper first started his sports administration career with the English Basketball Association as the National League Administrator in the 1970 's . In 1986 , he joined Umbro Sportswear and over a 13-year period , where he was instrumental in leading the brand 's dynamic global growth . Draper is also famously known for his stint with Manchester United 's as its first group marketing director appointed in 1999 . This is a position he held until he left in 2006 . <p> It comes uncontested that Manchester United was a legacy brand . However Valencia is still yet to find its footing in the football world . I ask Draper what are some of the challenges he faces in his current role . <p> " We 're now fighting in a big pond with big fish and that is definitely a challenge . We are looking to figuring out our own voice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He added that behind football stars , sits a team that looks to marketing the athletes and turning content around them relate-able to Asian audiences much like the big boys of Barcelona and Real Madrid have . <p> " There are already a lot of football clubs all banging their own drums for a long time out here . Are we a little bit late to market ? Yes . But you do n't always have to be first either . There is still space for us and we are getting out act together . We do n't necessarily have to resonate with every single market but we have to play our own game and find our own voice . " <p> Draper also added that being a challenger brand also has its perks . <p> " There has never been a line of people waiting to give Man U money , " he says . This is because when you are pitching at the high stake level as Manchester United is , a lot of brands and commercial partners do n't have the capability to fork out millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long run takes a toll because of the constant hard work required to develop those commercial relationships with entities . <p> " At Valencia , we are pitching at a lower level . We are looking at the mid market and the opportunities for brands to be associated with us to reach global audiences are far more , " he added . <p> Setting up in Asia <p> A key purpose for establishing an office in Singapore would be to form channel partnership with media houses in the region to cater to Asian audiences . While the La Liga has recently upped its push in distributing exclusive content to media channel partners , Draper added that the responsibility is on the individual clubs to leverage on this by supplementing it with its own content , such as behind the scenes footage of players ' lives or trainings . <p> " Football around the region is an important source of entertainment . The fans here are increasingly knowledgeable about the game and are beginning to look at Spanish football beyond the top two teams . They see the potential of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and developing our long-term presence in Asia is a key area in our strategic growth plan . " <p> The office will also be looking to tie up with commercial partners from a sponsorship and licensing perspective . <p> For Singapore , Draper was of the view that financial brands might have a big opportunity in partnering up with the football teams , revealing the kind of brands it was targeting . However , he was quick to acknowledge that many companies might feel that this was a " well trodden path " with big players such as Standard Chartered and Barclay 's already dominating the scene . <p> He added that brands simply need to have the mentality to think out of the box and " make it their own " . Meanwhile , he also said that Asian brands have not yet fully capitalised on the compelling platform of football . <p> " The ability to use football for communication and projection for a brand is still great and has not yet been exhausted at all by Asian brands . There are a lot of untapped opportunities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asian brands to get onto such global platforms , he adds . Unlike in the early 70 's where brands were closely tied to their nation 's heritage -- such as Toyota with Japanese heritage -- today brands coming out of the region such as Huawei , Sony or Samsung are trying to take on a more cosmopolitan stance . Global audiences have also evolved so that they no longer think of Korean , Japanese or Chinese products as inferior . This will be the same for brands that will soon emerge from the rising Asian markets such as India , Indonesia or Myanmar , Draper opined . <p> " These brands will be international in nature and football provides a platform for them to be promoted globally . For Asian brands looking to go West , football can provide a platform because it cuts across many demographics of fans . " <p> Over the last three weeks , Draper has been touring various countries across the region and was of the view that many Asian brands were on the brink of going global and all that was stopping them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spend and promote when you are ready to take advantage of it .

Millions of people today are still following every word the airline utters as the mystery of its airline MH370 goes unresolved . <p> " That kind of scrutiny can force you to not move , but we knew we had to move , " said Dean Dacko , CMO of Malaysia Airlines , who was speaking at the Adobe Digital Marketing Symposium 2015 . <p> He was quick to admit the past two years for the airline had not been easy ones , describing the entire journey as a " blur " and somewhat " surreal " . In the first 10 days after the MH370 tragedy , the company saw a huge commercial impact with 10 straight days of an average of 100,000 cancellations a day . <p> " The commercial impact was absolutely devastating and the magnitude of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the event impacting over 500 lives along with the staff members and colleagues we personally knew and worked with , " he said . <p> " Some days we could not believe what was happening to us . We went from managing one crisis to the second crisis of MH17 , to moving into totally recreating and the redevelopment of an entire organisation . All of which were across a relatively short period of time . " <p> Challenges of creating a refreshed identity <p> According to Dacko , because of the current restructuring of various MAS operations , the budget for rebranding is yet to be determined . However , he shared that a strategic brand steering committee had been created comprising of various teams internally and externally ( including stakeholders ) and agencies to develop this new visual identity . <p> MAS recently appointed M&amp;C Saatchi Malaysia as its master creative agency , and handed its brand identity task to recreate its logo and the visual aspects of the aircraft livery to a Singapore-based shop called Profit . The agency , which beat 18 other branding agencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MAS develop its brand strategy and visual components of the new logo . <p> For its rebranding , MAS is also looking to actively involve its staff members across various teams and departments so as to garner real-time feedback on various aspects . The airline is investing its time into creating employee " brand ambassadors " who can give guidance on the new MAS direction . <p> " We are fully aware that in the process of launching that new identity we will need the full support of its team of 14,000 . They will be the first ones leveraged with going out and promoting our new brand . So we need to engage them early on in the process . The new brand identity is not just something we present to them , but rather something they are involved in creating . That 's part of our process now , to really engage and involve our staff . " <p> However , the exact process is still undetermined as the organisation is in the midst of restarting things under new management . <p> The rebranding process , added Dacko @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought through because of the strong ties the airline has with the Malaysian people and its principal stakeholders . <p> " This rebranding is done not only from a financial standpoint , but rather keeping in mind the 42 years of history MAS has had with our audience . The airline is very much ingrained with the culture of Malaysia . They refer to us as a Malaysian icon and that is true . Changing and moving that is something that requires back and forth engagement , dialogue and serious thought . " <p> He reiterated that outside of Malaysia , the airline 's loyalty also runs deep with non-resident Malaysians because of the emotional warmth and support associated with the brand . <p> " One of the very first times that people travelled out of Malaysia was on MAS and they remember how warm and comforting it was for them . That 's not a feeling that goes away . When we talk about possibly creating a new brand that would change that relationship , we really need to take seriously the emotional ties beyond the reality of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identity falls short of the public 's expectations , one of the major risks would be losing the supporters of the brand and potentially turning them into the airline 's biggest detractors . <p> " It is very easy to just create a logo , but there is so much that goes beyond it . So on 1 September when we launch a new identity , rather than a new image , it will be the start of our new journey of evolution with tweaks and changes being made along the way . " <p> MAS ' digital evolution <p> Early last year , when Dacko spoke to Marketing , the airline was in the midst of making a big push into digital . MAS was then looking to move 70% of its marketing budget to digital . In 2013 , the split was 50-50 between traditional and digital . Before that , MAS ' marketing was completely tactical . <p> " The speed and pace of what we have done towards digital has slowed because of the nature of events we have faced over the past two years which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investments across a lot of channels , " he said . <p> While MAS has kept up its presence and velocity in making digital its primary channel of communication , it has probably not reached its earlier stated goals , Dacko admits . <p> The brand is nonetheless still as dedicated to moving in that direction and he remains firm in growing the investments being made into digital . <p> This commitment and need for digital was further reiterated in the first three weeks of MH370 going missing . From a digital platform perspective , MAS saw three major spikes in its website hits after the disaster . On a usual day , the website would take about 2000-3000 hits a second , but on those days it was tracking up to 230,000 hits per second . <p> " All the things we have leveraged in our communication , were never built on the premise of us facing a crisis such as the ones we faced . It was built purely for a business transformation process , " he said . <p> He explained the digital investments the brand made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missing was purely due to commercial reasons because the airline saw that it needed to move from a traditional environment to a digital one . <p> " Had we not made the new digital investments , our whole infrastructure would have collapsed . It was all the new technology and tools and resources we had just built that allowed us to move forward and continue engaging with audiences worldwide . It was never in the context of preparing for a crisis . " <p> Lessons learnt <p> Nonetheless , Dacko is positive his marketing team , and he personally , learnt a fair bit from the tragedies . Today , the brand is much more customer-centric and engaged on social media in an authentic way . Slowly , Dacko said , he sees consumer sentiment and trust growing . <p> No doubt in some markets such as China , the damage is bigger and it has been harder to gain back trust . But in Malaysia , the public has been immensely supportive . <p> One such early signs of support came from MAS ' #staystrong campaigns . The campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff to stay strong and fight through the calamities . But soon after , it was picked up by the public where consumers started communicating to the brand showing their love and support . <p> This , according to Dacko , was one of the pivotal moments that led him and his team to really open their eyes to the impact of social media being the backbone of modern communication . <p> The open dialogue with consumers is now something that has really taken root and MAS and the marketing team have been quick to capitalise and communicate on the platform . <p> " The reason for consumers having trust and confidence to fly the airline is based on the level of engagement we can create for them . <p> " On digital , you ca n't afford to go halfway . You ca n't be timid . The reality is that you have to make a commitment and you have to be real and authentic in communicating digitally . Otherwise the audience will see through it .

The World Health Organization classes sexually transmitted infections ( STI ) as infections that are spread primarily through person to person sexual contact . These infections are usually transmitted by sexual intercourse , including oral , vaginal and anal sex . <p> Several can also be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy and childbirth and from blood and tissue transfer . They are caused by the spread of organisms like bacteria , viruses or parasites . <p> The good news is most of these infections are treatable . They are all preventable . <p> The bad news is they are often uncomfortable . Antibiotics and other medications are needed for the treatment . <p> The ugly news is they are unattractive : rashes , discharges , lumps and sores . <p> So you do not have any symptoms , which means you are safe right ?

Miriam Heatherich : I 've been living in Singapore for four years and previously had a fashion label for 14 years . Since I wound down my business , I found myself with spare time . I was initially introduced to First Hand during an event in 2012 and was impressed by the passion of the First Hand team . I decided to get involved with First Hand and believed I could offer my business , marketing and bookkeeping experience . <p> Currently , First Hand is making impact on the lives of children in Cambodia . Why this nation ? Personally , I knew very little about Cambodia before I became involved with First Hand . While I had learned in school about the Pol Pot regime and its impact , I was not aware that there was a lasting effect on the Cambodian people . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without a family structure . As Cambodians struggle to find their way , they live with systemic corruption and apathy . In this vacuum , some Cambodian families , living in devastating poverty are tricked by traffickers into selling their children . We work with NGOs that rescue and rehabilitate trafficked disabled children , after being sold to beg in Thailand . I can not imagine a more vulnerable group of people than children who are sold by their parents , and due to their disabilities are not even able to escape from their traffickers . <p> Any plans on expanding your reach to other countries ? The problem of child trafficking is also really prevalent in the Philippines . If we can expand our committee , it would be wonderful to help communities and other NGOs in the Philippines . This is no simple task . We would need to audit the organisations we would be working with . At First Hand , we have -- quite literally -- a first-hand approach , making sure the funds are appropriately spent , making sure our Cambodian partners have regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First Hand different from other charity groups ?

Also , no funds are spent on administration costs . The committee is doing everything from our home computers and printers . I do n't know many organisations that can claim 100% no administration fees , so this aspect of First Hand really makes us different . It is certainly one of the reasons we have been an attractive charity to become a sponsor of . Our sponsors enjoy the fact that 100% of their contributions are delivered to projects in Cambodia , so our sponsors truly make a significant difference . <p> Additionally , we encourage regular contact with our Cambodian partners and have long-term relationships with them .

We were then able to visit her six months later where we managed to post pictures of her on Facebook sitting up for the first time . This is an example of the First Hands impact , made possible only because of our sponsors . <p> How are funds raised at your events ? My background in fashion led me to organise ' Runway Heroes ' in May 2015 . It was a fashion-focused event and we were fortunate to showcase directly after Singapore Fashion Week .

This way our sponsors can stay informed of the impact their funds make . <p> Have you any final thoughts about the achievements of First Hand and its plans for the future ? ? I have n't done anything in my life that is as satisfying as being involved in First Hand . I read a wonderful quote today and it went something like this : " True satisfaction is giving to someone who can never thank you .

@@3628233 <p> Indonesia 's Vice-President Jusuf Kalla has sparked controversy in recent weeks over his comments on the ongoing haze that has blanketed parts of Indonesia , Malaysia and Singapore . Last Friday ( Sept 25 ) , the 73 year-old caused a stir when he was quoted saying that Indonesia need not apologise to neighbouring countries over the haze , adding that it needed only to ensure that the forest fires do not recur . <p> Those comments echoed similar ones he made in March and in previous years , criticising the country 's neighbours for grumbling about the haze . <p> Here is what you need to know about the Indonesian No. 2. <h> 1 . Family background and education <p> Born in South Sulawesi , Mr Kalla came from a successful business family trading in silk and commodities in Makassar . He attended the University of Hasanuddin in Makassar and graduated in 1967 with an economics degree .

He later climbed the ranks , before entering parliament as a regional representative for South Sulawesi , serving four terms from 1992 to 1999 . <p> In 1999 , Mr Kalla served briefly as trade minister under President Abdurrahman Wahid , also known as Gus Dur , before he was fired over corruption allegations . Mr Kalla denied the charges . <p> However , Mr Kalla 's political career was not yet over . He returned to the Cabinet as welfare minister when then Vice-President Megawati Sukarnoputri took over the presidency from Mr Gus Dur after the presidency collapsed in 2001 following allegations of corruption and incompetence . <p> During this time , Mr Kalla became more popular and he decided to run in the 2004 presidential elections as a candidate .

Career in government <p> Known to be decisive and unwavering , Mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first term as vice-president , helped to drive through parliament some unpopular government polices . However , his outspoken nature meant that his relationship with Dr Yudhoyono soured during the administration . <p> Although Dr Yudhoyono found him a difficult deputy at times , Mr Kalla was an able operative in fending off attacks on the administration from opposition politicians trying to undermine the government . Analysts have said Mr Kalla 's " impulsive " streak and independent ways upset Dr Yudhoyono and led to Mr Kalla being dropped during Dr Yudhoyono 's re-election bid in 2009 . <p> Mr Kalla , however , decided to contest against his former boss in the election and he ran the campaign with former military chief Wiranto . The duo lost , coming in third against Dr Yudhoyono and his running mate Boediono and second-place finisher Megawati and her running mate Prabowo Subianto . <p> Mr Kalla came under the spotlight again in the lead-up to the 2014 presidential election , emerging as the widely favoured running mate for then-presidential hopeful Joko Widodo .

@@4868230 the best deals <p> The time of year has come again when Valve is hacking the price of thousands of games in order to impoverish Steam 's 150 million-strong user base . <p> We 've sifted through the endless lists percentages and pound signs to bring you the best of the best . But beware , the sale only runs until 1 December , after which these games will be going , going , gone . <p> BioShock Triple Pack -85% ( S$8.25 ) <p> For this pitiful sum you receive two of the most important games of the past ten years . In 2007 BioShock rocked the FPS genre with an intelligent plot and a multi-path approach to combat , and its titanic influence can be felt in almost every shooter on the market today . It also managed to use the name ' Big Daddy ' without sounding like a cheap porno . Bravo . <p> BioShock Infinite trod a similar path and its all-round excellence made it a standout title of 2013 . Booker and Elizabeth 's journey is a tremendous feat of videogame storytelling that must n't be missed : it messed with our heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligent AAA game of last year , and at a bargain price . <p> Alien Isolation 's approach to stealth is totally unique .

We 'll never forget the first time we dashed into a locker believing we 'd made it to safety , only to be dragged out kicking and screaming when the alien heard us breathing . Not for the faint-hearted , this one . <p> The impending arrival of The Force Awakens has us more excited than C3PO on polishing day , but sadly it 's still almost a month away . <p> Luckily the Star Wars brand has birthed a slew of amazing games to keep you occupied until release . The Star Wars Collection features gems such as Knights of the Old Republic 1 and 2 , Jedi Knight II , and the original Dark Forces . <p> Sure , we 're not as crazy about The Force Unleashed or The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but for just over seventeen pounds you receive fourteen full games - a ratio not to be scoffed at . <p> Post-apocalyptic dystopias might be all the rage at the moment , but the Fallout series was making mass extinction en vogue before these newcomers were a twinkle in their creator 's eye . <p> From Fallout : New Vegas to the original Fallout , every single game ( bar Fallout 4 ) has been hacked in price , which means you can pick up the likes of Fallout 3 for a fiver . They might not look as fancy as the latest instalment , but these old timers have a lot to offer anyone wanting to explore every possible nook and cranny of the Wasteland . <p> Valve 's rate of production as a games developer is woefully slow ( curse you , Valve Time ... ) but whenever it does release a new title into the wild it 's always guaranteed to make a splash . <p> The Valve Complete Pack contains every single one of the company 's creations . Half-Life , Portal , Portal 2 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... the list reads like a diary of moments that changed gaming forever . This is a mightily affordable way to fill the gaps in your videogame education . <p> The Witcher series has deservedly won a place in the annals of gaming fame by scoring top marks in almost every category . Not only does the trilogy feature the sturdiest combat mechanics of any action-RPG series out there , but its world is consistently , and lovingly realised . <p> In spite of the fact that The Witcher III is only six months old , it 's still featured in this sub-thirty pound pack . Even better , the combined play-time of all three titles comes in at a gargantuan 200 hours . If that is n't value for money , we do n't know what is . <h> And all the rest .... <p> The above are just a small smattering of over 8000 discounts Valve are offering over the next few days .

We put Saturday and Sunday 's editions to bed and are pretty much chained to our desks . <p> But last Friday , I have a bad burger craving and decide to do a quick eat-and-run meal with a friend at Wildfire Burgers + Bar ( 26 Evans Road , 01-06 , tel : 6734-2080 ) . <p> My favourite burger there is the Classic 001 ( $16 ) , a juicy patty without too many distractions . There is lettuce , tomato , caramelised onion and cheese , plus sauce . The well-constructed burger is a joy to eat . Better yet , the bun is a sturdy thing that does not get too soggy . <p> The restaurant recently introduced three different versions of boneless fried chicken ( $13 for six pieces ) and my favourite is the Umami Fried Chicken , drizzled with yuzu kosho mayonnaise . <p> That and a couple of Cokes make for a very quick and satisfying lunch . <p> The flavourful , cloudy soup has depth of flavour and is loaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some rather gritty seaweed . The kitchen staff should clean it more thoroughly . <p> You can choose from pomfret and red garoupa , and we sprang for the garoupa ( $50 ) . When I used to do zi char reviews , I had written about overcooked fish at Whampoa Keng . <p> The trick is to remove all the fish from the steamboat the minute it comes to the table ( and of course , after taking a photo of it ) . I do that this time and it works a charm , none of the fish pieces are overcooked . <p> Dip them into the tangy chilli sauce , slurp up some soup and all is wonderful . <h> SOON KUEH WITH SOON <p> The " soon " in soon kueh is Hokkien for bamboo shoots but these days , most places that sell the snack use yambean or bangkwang for the filling . <p> Poh Cheu ( Block 127 Bukit Merah Lane 1 , 01-230 , tel : 6276-2287 ) is one of few stalls that sell soon kueh with bamboo shoots ( $1 each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A thoughtful friend of mine gave some to me and I am planning to go there and get more soon . <p> The filling is not sweet like the ones filled with yambean .

The next day , let them come to room temperature then pan fry them in a non-stick pan until the skin is golden brown in parts . You will not need additional oil because there is already a layer of it over the kueh . <p> Also , remember to call and check if the bamboo shoot soon kueh is available before heading to the store . <h> ANOTHER ADDICTIVE SNACK <p> My cup often runneth over and I am thankful for kind friends who tell me about their food finds or give me delicious things they are eating . <p> One friend gives me Jax Coco 's toasted coconut chips and they have become an obsession . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $2.95 and there is a promotion now of five bags for $12 . <p> The lightly browned coconut shavings are crisp and just a little bit sweet .

Of course , I am just kidding myself but for now , I can not get enough of these chips . <h> HOMEY DRINK <p> My mother has been making cooling drinks for me almost all my life .

" <p> Now that you have prepared good and appealing content that is relevant to your customers , how do you spread the message ? <p> Jodie Cheung , regional head of marketing of the Japanese chain restaurants division at Maxim 's , shared Genki Sushi 's first digital-based brand campaign earlier this year in light of connecting with its consumers , especially the digitally savvy ones . <p> The initiative was a 365-day transmedia mini drama series that was split into two seasons airing on social media , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a sushi chef . <p> This campaign was also taken off line to its restaurants and other media . <p> To bring the story into reality , the thematic campaign also saw the leading roles overtaking Genki 's Facebook page to interact with social media users and achieved some 2.5 million views on the drama . <p> " The campaign-based ( marketing ) approach is history , " said Cheung as she reckoned constantly bombarding digital natives with too much information can easily turn them off . Cheung said the " always-on " strategy , such as this two-season mini-drama series , was a good way to engage them . <p> In the digital world , it 's generally agreed visual content is more powerful than words . The industry has recently seen brands actively embracing digital videos across different social platforms and channels . <p> The secret to getting digital content right is the right length , according to Rupam Borthakur , managing director of Hong Kong and Taiwan at Millward Brown . <p> " Your audience is more impatient than ever so show them the best in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To create buzz , facilitating entertaining and humorous content can be the way to catch people 's eyes when it comes to online videos . <p> " Consumers want content that is interesting , enjoyable or useful , " he said . <p> Panel discussion : Breaking through the noise of today 's content overload <p> Jodie Cheung , regional head of marketing , Japanese chain restaurants at Maxim 's Caterers Limited <p> After all , in today 's multichannel communications world , it 's rather easy to get sidetracked and forget the fundamentals of marketing .

@@4874238 <p> In fact , multiple studies conducted in the run-up to the summit show how developing nations like India and China have committed to do way more than what their share in the problem is . <h> What does a " fair share " mean ? <p> If you pollute , you are responsible for the cleanup . This is a principle of justice known as the " polluter pays " . " Fair share " takes it one step ahead . Suppose three persons polluted , but one of them is responsible for 70% of the pollution . This polluter should then be responsible for 70% of the cleanup -- or 70% is the " fair share " in the cleanup . <p> Climate change is no different . Because carbon remains in the air for decades , past emissions matter . So even though countries like China and India are emitting a lot of carbon today , their historical responsibility is small compared with the United States , Japan and European nations . In the Kyoto Protocol , these countries were found to have emitted 70% of the carbon that is causing global warming . <h> Big gaps <p> You would expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our atmosphere . At least that 's how they would like us to know . But the emperor has been disrobed , and how . A collaboration of NGOs calculated the fair share of these countries and found that they have not committed even half of what they should have . <p> The United States and European nations , for example , have committed for just one-fifth of what their fair share should be . <p> The US has emitted over 9 billion tonnes of carbon since 1950 but it has promised to cut just about 2 billion . <p> In fact the US ' commitments are no different from their " business-as-usual " i.e. they have n't done anything exceptional for climate action , according to a study by the Centre for Science and Environment . <p> Japan 's commitment is one-tenth . <p> Russia 's is zero , as they are actually aiming for higher emissions in the future . <p> In contrast , poorer nations have together committed to emissions reductions equal to their fair share of 9 Gigatons . <p> In fact India , Kenya , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shares . <p> India 's share in emissions since 1950 is 353 million tonnes , but it has pledged to cut down 486 million tonnes by 2030 . <p> This comes with a rider : India 's promises are conditional on receiving money and technology from rich countries . <p> That takes us to the second way in which developed countries have shied away from doing their bit -- assisting poorer countries . <h> What should the rich countries have done ? <p> The report by the NGOs collective says that the fair share of developed nations is so big that the cut down is impossible to carry out in their countries . <p> This is where their assistance to poorer nations counts . Beyond what they can do within their borders , the developed countries are expected to provide cheap technology and easy finance to the poor countries . Many refer to such help as returning the " climate debt " that the rich countries owe to the rest of the world for causing the climate problem . <h> The Adaptation Gap <p> One way they ought to contribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to improve their ability to defend themselves against rising temperatures , floods , droughts and storms . This is known as adaptation . <p> Adaptation includes not just building infrastructure to protect from extreme events ( such as building storm shelters and waterproofing houses ) , but also ensuring reliable water supply and encouraging cultivation of native pest-resistant crops . <p> These things cost both money , and sometimes need new innovations found commonly in developed nations , but which are expensive due to intellectual property rights . <p> India 's share in emissions since 1950 is 353 million tonnes . It aims to cut down 486 million tonnes <p> Even in adaptation , there are " fair shares " of assistance to poor countries , which are not responsible for the problem but are facing the impacts . But even here the rich countries ' commitments fall short -- as a study , aptly titled " Mind the Adaptation Gap " , by ActionAid International shows . <p> In 2013 , the financial assistance to poor nations was just about $3-5 billion . <p> By 2020 , it should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $150 billion by 2025 . <p> For most rich countries , this is not much -- it amounts to just 0.1% of their GDP , according to ActionAid . <p> Current commitments by the US are so low that they need to increase 60 times by 2020 to be fair . <p> France has to raise its current finance by 30 times . <h> What does this mean for the Paris summit ? <p> The report put out by the NGO collective , called " Fair Shares : A Civil Society Equity Review of INDCs " -- does n't mince words . It says that such injustice are what caused the climate problem , and should be rooted out to find a solution to the crisis . <p> Not addressing the " historical inequalities " at the Paris summit will have a " damaging impact on the negotiations around a new , legally binding climate agreement in Paris in December and on our ability to collectively tackle the climate crisis itself , " the NGO report says . <p> Moreover , as ActionAid points out , failing to do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

Many who are familiar with his works will agree that they are hardly classified as the typical travel writings like Lonely Planet guidebooks or reviews of glamourous hotels and establishments . <p> Instead , Agustinus travels to contemplate intrapersonal conflicts and writes about them , taking readers along to experience his physical and mental tribulations . <p> No doubt , he is a great storyteller and in Singapore , GIV had the privilege to sit down and listen to his adventure in Papua New Guinea , Indonesia 's closest , yet the furthest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So this is the reason of the anger . The injustice , economic wise , the opportunity to survive , is very unjust . " <h> Papua New Guinea or Papua Province ? <p> Despite being neighbours , citizens of both Indonesia and Papua New Guinea know near to nothing about each other . When Agustinus was in Papua New Guinea , he was asked , " How is life in Indonesia as a communist country ? " <p> He finds the borders intriguing , as it is created neither by Indonesia nor Papua New Guinea , but by another country during the colonization era . <p> " It is interesting to see how a straight and artificial line like this separates people from both sides , " said the writer . This triggers him to go and to explore along the line . <p> " In reality , the line does not exist : we can not see the line as it is deep in the jungle , " Agustinus shared to GIV . <p> So , he went to the Western Province , the most isolated area in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the river . There are not many public transportations in that country , so he waited at each village for a fisherman to come and hitchhiked in his canoe . <p> " All along 400 km of river , and it took me one and a half months , " he stated . The road on Indonesia 's side of border is more efficient and will only take eight hours . He mentioned it as one of the highlights of his journey , as he may be the first foreigner who hitchhiked canoe . <p> The knowmad told GIV that one of the most interesting part of his journey was staying with the OPM ( Operasi Papua Merdeka or Free Papua Operation ; people of Indonesia 's Papua who fight against the government of Indonesia for their freedom ) rebels . <p> According to Agustinus , Indonesians referred to them as refugees , but actually many of those people migrated from Indonesia 's Papua to Papua New Guinea as part of their struggle against Indonesia 's central government . <p> " These people are forgotten . Nobody writes about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of fear of Indonesia and Indonesians so it was quite hard for me to get accepted by the people , " recounted the travel writer , mentioning that he eventually stayed with them at their camps . <p> Many of the OPM camps are located in the southern area of Indonesia 's border but they are hard to reach from the populated part of Indonesia . If you go there from Papua New Guinea , you need to cross three rivers ; but from Indonesia 's side , you have to cross five deep rivers . <p> For the locals , the border itself is so vague that they could not differentiate which part belongs to which country . There is even a village of OPM members , with facilities such as schools , that was built on Indonesia 's land , but they put Papua New Guinea 's flag and the people go to Papua New Guinea 's market ; because they did not realize that they are on Indonesia 's territory . <p> " Nobody knows where the border is , " emphasized Agustinus . He also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people are the children of people who are struggling . In the 1984 , they moved to Papua New Guinea , " said the knowmad . <p> But that generation passed away and their children did not know about the struggle . " They do n't even know whether they are Indonesian or Papua New Guinean ! " <p> " What will be their future ? " Agustinus wonders while taking this photograph at Tais in Papua New Guinea . ( Photo source : Agustinus Wibowo ) <h> Cultural Destruction and Responsible Travel <p> It was indeed a compelling story and a thrilling journey but do not pack your bag just yet , Agustinus may advise . Responsible travel is more important than the quantity of travelers , said the travel writer and photographer . <p> " Many places in Papua have been destroyed culturally by visitors , by outsiders especially , " he stated . <p> " I started to understand about OPM struggle after I live with them , " he added . After crossing the border from Papua New Guinea to Papua province ( on the Indonesian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience Papua or see the local Papuans anymore . You see mainly Javanese people , speaking Javanese , opening Javanese restaurants . <p> " Now many cities are drowned by outsiders . If you go to Merauke ( the most Eastern outer part of Indonesia in Papua ) , about 80 percent are outsiders . " <p> Although , on the contrary , the more foreign culture has positive contribution where local Papuans pick up technology from them , evident from their ways of living . He noticed that the ways of cooking are different and food are more delicious on the Indonesian side of Papua . <p> Generally , Papua is less developed than other parts of Indonesia . The people in Papua are still living quite traditionally as compared to , for example , those in Java . So , as Agustinus put it , " How can these people compete with the outsiders ? " <p> When these outsiders migrate to Papua , they prefer to hire outsiders as they are more educated and have more relevant working experiences . It causes inequality as Indonesians of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Papua is being discriminated . <p> " So how can they survive ? So this is the reason of the anger . The injustice , economic wise , the opportunity to survive , is very unjust . " <p> However , Agustinus does not mean to discourage people from visiting Papua . " I encourage people ( to travel ) of course , when they are responsible to society , they respect the culture , " he argued . <p> The thing is , when some places in Indonesia open up to tourism , they offer their tribal culture and primitiveness , and yet some tourists may exploit and may not be responsible enough to respect the locals as fellow human beings . <p> " This is reducing the value of their culture , reducing the value of their humanity , " he urged travelers to treat local as how they would like to be treated , with dignity and respect . 
@@4876237 <h> Early Bird <h> Early Bird <p> In order to help developing countries emit less carbon and deal with climate change , rich countries promised to pay poorer nations $100 billion each year until 2020 . This promise was made at the 2010 climate change summit . <p> But the funding has barely crossed $2 billion , or 0.5% of the promised amount , according to a Finance Ministry study . <p> This is in sharp contrast to a report by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) , a grouping of rich nations , claiming in October that an average $57 billion flowed in 2013 and 2014 . <p> The differences are steeped in accounting definitions . Still they are important as such funding is crucial for India and other developing nations to deal with climate change . That money is meant to be used in areas such as clean technologies , cheaper renewable energy , disaster management and flood control measures . <p> ' Climate finance ' - that 's what it is known as in climate jargon - is an important part of the climate negotiations that start today in Paris . India will bargain hard for not just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also for a plan for financing beyond 2020 . <p> But if the finance ministry 's report is to be believed , rich nations are counting money spent on projects with very little climate component . They are also believed to be diverting development aid to pay up for climate finance . <h> What rich nations say ? <p> An average payment of $57 billion in 2013 and 2014 , according to OECD . <p> But that included aid to developing countries if any project had any climate-friendly component . <p> At $22 billion , such " bilateral " finance was almost half the total climate finance . <p> $18 billion came from multilateral institutions such as World Bank ( read below how only 7-9% of this was found to be actually for climate change-related projects . ) <p> Japan and Australia have included funding clean coal plants as climate finance . <p> Predictably , this report was flayed by developing countries , who called it ' green washing ' , claiming that very little funding has actually come in . They especially quoted the " new and additional " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part of existing development aid or even private investment . Climate finance has to be in addition to such " business as usual " funding . <h> What India has said <p> The finance ministry 's report was prepared by the Climate Change Finance Unit of the Department of Economic Affairs ( DEA ) . It was put out on 29 November . <p> The strongly-worded report say the OECD report has " serious problems on all counts " . It accuses the OECD of <p> not using a definition of climate finance , on a par with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change <p> " bending " the method of finding the amount of money to show more than real fund flows <p> relying on self-reporting by funding bodies rather than " independent and credible " sources " <p> Although the report starts with the disclaimer that these view are not necessarily those of the Government of India , that is n't strictly true . Much before the report was released , Environment Ministry officials have been highlighting " double-counting " of development assistance as climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the points to fight out at Paris . <p> The DEA 's report says : <p> OECD 's calculations include commitments on paper . Instead , actual money transferred should be calculated . Commitments can be included only if they have been fulfilled for " several " years . <p> By this logic , while $32 billion have been pledged , only $17 billion have actually been mobilised . Just $14 billion was committed to projects . <p> Of this , just $2.2 billion was actually disbursed . <p> It goes on to attack OECD about the way it calculates different kinds of funding as climate finance : <p> Aid agencies like the World Bank classify several projects as " climate " projects even though they may have nothing to do with climate . In 2014 and 2015 only 7-9% of World Bank 's claimed climate funding actually had something to do with clean energy or to adaptation to disasters and floods . <p> OECD had claimed multilateral development banks ( like World Bank ) are the largest contributor to total climate funding . This too has been contested by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount to be about $18 billion , it is actually around $3.4 billion . <p> The report says that rich nations are diverting their developmental aid into climate finance . This is proven by how the amount of climate finance aspect has increased significantly even though total aid has not risen since 2008 . <p> Such diversions accounted for almost half the $24 billion total bilateral climate commitments in 2013-14 . <p> Here , too , the ministry says that climate finance has to be " new and additional " . This means that climate finance worth $100 billion has to be over and above usual investments that a country may do in renewables or to improve its response to extreme climate changes like storms and floods . <h> What 's the way ahead ? <p> The problem is that each agency has its own way of defining climate finance . So far the ministry 's approach appears to be the most pragmatic - of calculating only the actual money inflows ( and not commitments ) since there is no fixed definition of what exactly constitutes climate finance . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OECD method and reduce their own responsibility to pay up . Expectedly , US negotiator Todd Stern welcomed the report when it was released . <p> At Paris , it will likely become one of the many tools the developed world will use in the 12-day long negotiations to show that they have put in enough efforts already . But coming on the very eve of the summit , the ministry 's strong rebuttal signals that the Indian side will not go down easily .

The results indicated these players showed only " mediocre interest " in visiting casinos located in other parts of the Asia Pacific region , according to the UBS report , released on Monday . <p> " We think other Asian casinos will unlikely be able compete with Macau for mainland Chinese base mass gamblers until at least 2019 , when quality products and critical mass might form in markets such as South Korea , " the UBS team wrote . <p> It added : " Base mass gamblers ' awareness of and intention to visit Asian casinos are mediocre , according to our survey . However , the interest in Las Vegas casinos appears high . " <p> The survey was conducted in October . Respondents spent on average RMB12,000 ( US$1,875 ) on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by drop -- i.e. money spent on buying chips . On average the respondents visited the city 2.3 times a year , patronising 1.8 casinos on average per trip . <p> The survey results showed that -- excluding Macau venues -- around half of the respondents could name either a country where there was a casino or a specific Asian casino : about 30 percent named a country and 20 percent named a specific casino . In addition , only some 10 percent of the respondents reported having been to an Asian casino outside Macau , with venues in Malaysia , South Korea and Singapore as the most popular destinations . <p> " However , we believe regional competition for access to Chinese VIP players has begun and will continue , " the UBS team stated . <p> It added : " We estimate Macau 's share of regional VIP players has reduced from about 84 percent in 2011 to 76 percent in 2015 . We expect its share to go down further to about 66 percent by 2019 .

" <p> Smoking ban to hurt demand <p> The UBS survey also indicated that any further smoking restrictions in Macau , namely the abolition of smoking lounges on the mass-market floors , could result in reduced demand for gambling visits to Macau among mainland Chinese players . <p> When asked if a full smoking ban would affect their decision to visit Macau , 3 percent of respondents said they would stop going to Macau ; 6 percent said they would maker fewer visits . Some 21 percent said that a full smoking ban would have a small impact in their time spent gambling in Macau , while about 6 percent stated they would go to Macau more often . <p> On July 10 , legislators in Macau approved the first reading of a government bill that proposes the abolition of casino smoking lounges and a full smoking ban in VIP areas .

The study was commissioned by Macau 's six gaming concessionaires . <p> UBS 's survey of mass-market players looked at other issues , including the possible impact on Macau 's gaming industry of further restrictions by the mainland authorities on the China UnionPay Ltd electronic transfer system for cross border payments . About 20 percent of respondents said they used UnionPay cards to get cash from ATM machines in Macau , but none said they used UnionPay at jewellery shops as a source of funding for gaming . <p> " This is perhaps not too surprising ; given their level of spending , base mass players tend to rely less on UnionPay than premium mass players , " the UBS report stated . <p> The survey showed any further restrictions on UnionPay usage were likely to have a negative impact on spending intentions . Close to 70 percent of the respondents stated they believed more restrictions would reduce their gaming spending in Macau in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in September , with effect from next month , each UnionPay-enabled card will have a new , annual , RMB100,000 cash withdrawal limit at automated teller machines outside mainland China . <p> New supply positive <p> Meanwhile , the new properties opening in Macau 's Cotai district appear to be attractive to mass-market players from mainland China , the UBS survey indicated . Among the respondents , 56 percent believed they would visit Macau more often because of the new casinos , with Studio City more favoured than Galaxy Macau 's phase 2 among recent openings , and The Parisian -- still under construction -- more preferred among the Cotai resorts still to open . <p> The UBS survey showed " healthy spending intentions " among mainland Chinese base mass customers to Macau , with a 5 percent net increase in frequency and a slight -- 2 percent -- increase in gambling budget for the next trip to Macau , the report stated . <p> " This supports our base mass demand growth estimate for Macau of about 7 percent in the first half of 2016 from the second half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It added : " To our surprise , high-end spenders in the base mass segment ( average drop of RMB63,000 per trip ) expressed the strongest interest to visit more often ( 19 percent , compared with 5 to 9 percent for lower-end spenders ) and planned a slightly larger budget increase . " <p> UBS estimates that the mass segment generates about 50 percent of casino earnings before interest , taxation , depreciation and amortisation ( EBITDA ) in Macau . The segment accounted for 44 percent of the city 's gross gaming revenue in the first nine months of 2015 , according to data from Macau 's casino regulator . <p> UBS stated that the two properties in Macau with the highest exposure to higher-end base mass players were MGM Macau and City of Dreams , according to its survey . <p> Existing customers also showed " high stickiness to casinos , " the survey from UBS indicated .

" The expectation has become , as IDC 's Christina Richmond , program director , security services , said , " Breach is a foregone conclusion . " <p> For many companies , the attacks are frequent and more advanced . Richmond said , " **29;1276;TOOLONG attacks are no longer an isolated event . Sophisticated attacks hit companies of all sizes , in all industries . " <p> According to a recent report from Neustar , the odds of getting attacked are one in two , but once an enterprise has been attacked , the likelihood that they will be attacked again is 80 percent . The report also talked about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacks . <p> " If the attacker 's goal is n't to cause an outage but to disrupt , he does n't need to craft an attack of extra-large proportions . A SYN Flood attack is a good example . The attacker sends enough SYN requests to a company 's system to consume server resources and stall legitimate traffic , " the report said . <p> The method of attacks have changed in complexity and variability . Attackers do n't launch a single attack but rather send out waves and multiple vectors . " They may launch an email attack or attack an application or a server . They may launch multiple attacks in different vectors , coming from different places and attacking different targets , " said Joe Loveless , senior security manager , Neustar . <p> Larger attacks are easier to detect and mitigate , but these smaller , frequent attacks result in more significant damage , Loveless said . " They create chaos but still leave access open somewhere else , " he continued . The result , according to Neustar 's report is that one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Another growing trend in DDoS is ransom . " Extortion is becoming more common , and companies are paying ransom to avoid being attacked but they are getting attacked anyway , " Loveless said . <p> These attacks are particularly concerning because of the attacker 's stealthy ability to infiltrate the security environment during a disruption . Once they have access , they take a slow and steady approach and often go undetected until they have reached their target : valuable corporate data or funds . <p> Extortion is becoming more common , and companies are paying ransom to avoid being attacked but they are getting attacked anyway . Joe Loveless , senior security manager , Neustar <p> " IDC believes that the customer is often the first to report a DDoS attack because their user experience suffers when they ca n't access a web site to buy a product , pay a bill , or find support , " Richmond said . The result is not only a financial loss , but a strike against brand and reputation . <p> According to Dave Larson COO , Corero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on in the landscape and it 's hard to say whether these are rapidly changing or we are just starting to see them . " <p> Denying service , which seems like it would have to be a big giant attack , is actually the result of something much smaller . " Almost 72% of attacks last less than five minutes and 93% are less than 1GB per second in capacity , " said Larson . <p> The attacks , though , are not about denying service . Larson said , " These are n't just randomly occurring . People are orchestrating them , and they have to be doing this for a reason . We are starting to see material data breaches that included DDoS attacks as part of a multi vector intrusion . " <p> These smoke screen style attacks have significant impact on an enterprise because by design , they are distracting , which leaves security professionals looking in all the wrong places . " DDoS itself is n't creating the data compromise , but if it is causing you to look in the wrong place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have already been breached and you do n't know it , " said Larson . <p> Constantly monitoring the environment to make sure that no unknown traffic is crawling around in the network will help to prevent a data compromise after a DDoS attack . Larson said , " You can imagine that more down in the weeds the impact could be that your environment is being scanned and crawled and floor planned . The bad guys are figuring out what they need to gain access . " <p> The cost of recovering from an attack is significant , particularly for small and midsize businesses . In a special report on security risks , Kaspersky Labs noted , " On average , a DDoS attack costs SMBs more than $50K in recovery bills , which is significantly more than the typical costs they face recovering from other types of attack . " <p> For some reason , though , companies still are n't convinced that investing in security against DDoS attacks is money well spent . The Kaspersky Labs survey found that only around half of respondents ( 56% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mitigate an attack would be worth the investment . <p> Evgeny Vigovsky , head of Kaspersky DDoS Protection at Kaspersky Labs said , " Protection from DDoS attacks is an important part of risk management , yet only 34% of survey respondents have fully implemented DDoS prevention systems of any type . " <p> There are many factors to consider in evaluating risks for enterprises , from dependence on online services to other resources . " In most cases , online services--websites , emails , databases--are critical . Without them , normal workflow stops , " said Vigovsky . <p> " Costs associated with failed online services are bigger than expenses for prevention solutions , but unfortunately , there are still companies that do not include DDoS attacks in their risk management strategy , " Vigovsky continued . <p> The risks of not investing in DDoS prevention and protection are more than monetary . " When a company has to mitigate an attack that is taking place instead of preventing an attack from occurring , then they will pay a steep price for not only lost business contracts and damaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Vigovsky . <p> Echoing the need for prevention and protection , Larson said , " All reasonably likely to be attacked environments should have DDoS defense on the perimeter . " <p> One measure enterprises should take to build a culture that prioritizes security and prepares for the inevitable of an attack is , " Simulating worst-case scenarios in order to create a corresponding cybersecurity strategy , " said Vigovsky . <p> Enterprises can take steps toward making security a central concern for all . " A comprehensive strategy should include a combination of IT solutions , security policies and prepared staff to help prevent cyberattacks , " Vigovsky said . <p> Richmond said , " IDC believes that security needs to move toward being a positive contributor to the business . Security in and of and for and by itself no longer works .

However , a recent report from ConsumerLab.com , which tests dietary supplements and nutritional products , suggests a more modest benefit for matcha over regular green tea . <p> " You 'll get about two to three times more EGCG from matcha " than from regular green tea , says Tod Cooperman , president of ConsumerLab.com , of White Plains , N.Y .

@@4914240 <h> British business leaders dismayed after govt delays decision on Heathrow expansion <p> LONDON * British Airways ' ( BA ) parent group has threatened to develop the business abroad rather than in Britain after the government further delayed a decision on expanding airport capacity . <p> Prime Minister David Cameron had promised a decision on where to expand airport capacity in south- east England by the end of the year , but last week said no decision would be taken until at least the middle of next year . <p> Business chiefs have lobbied for a third runway at London 's Heathrow , Europe 's busiest airport , and British Chambers of Commerce director-general John Longworth condemned the delay as " gutless " . <p> British Airways parent IAG said it was an ego-driven decision after Mr Cameron 's pledge five years ago to block the hub 's expansion .
