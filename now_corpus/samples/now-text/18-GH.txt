Paradigm-shift type money , in fact . <p> Neymar 's fee was explained away by the fact that Paris Saint-Germain wanted to make a statement , packs a bigger punch commercially than anyone not named Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo and by the fact that this was the release clause in his contract . Mbappe turned 19 last month and if you believe he 's perhaps the most gifted teenager we 've seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of opportunities to amortise the expense . Plus , there 's serious resale potential . <p> But Coutinho is 25 . It 's hard to argue that you 're buying potential . What you are buying is a guy who watched the 2014 World Cup in Brazil and who , if you ignore his hat-trick against ( ahem ) Haiti in the Copa America , scored his first international goal in a competitive game less than 14 months ago . He made the PFA Premier League team of the year once in his five seasons with Liverpool ( three years ago ) and has started 30 league games or more just once in his career . <p> None of this is a knock on Coutinho , by the way . It 's just that relative to the other most expensive players ever , he 's neither a young potential superstar nor a G.O.A.T . in waiting . Instead , he 's an exceptional footballer who , rightly or wrong , has been deemed a notch below the very highest echelon for most of his career . <p> Which brings us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply attribute it to the fact that Barca were sitting on the money from Neymar 's sale and were desperate .

Barca do n't need Coutinho to win La Liga and he ca n't play in the Champions League this season . ( Incidentally , this is why Liverpool tried to persuade Barca to loan him back to them through the end of the current campaign . ) <p> David Ramos/Getty Images <p> In other words , there 's no particular upward pressure on the fee other than Liverpool 's ability to negotiate , the fact that it 's January and Barcelona 's opinion of Coutinho is obviously very , very high .

In fact , Coutinho 's versatility may help explain ( in part ) his valuation . The stock answer is that he 's the long-term replacement for Andres Iniesta , who turns 34 at the end of the season . The fact that Coutinho is cup-tied means he can take plenty of Iniesta 's La Liga minutes , allowing him to be fresh for the Champions League . That may well be true but Coutinho has shown he is equally adept operating wide in a front three ( in fact , he often played there for Liverpool and for Brazil ) . <p> Other than replacing Sergio Busquets or Luis Suarez , he can fill any role in Ernesto Valverde 's front six and do it with quality . In fact , few players of his caliber are as versatile and the fact that Valverde will have six months to figure out what to do with him before next season is a definite bonus . <p> As for Liverpool , all you can really do is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losing out on Champions League football ( likely worth anywhere from &amp;dollar ; 50-150m next season ) outweighed whatever premium Barcelona were willing to pay .

" That 's great , sure , but it happened last season to Sulley Muntari when he visited Cagliari . <p> Nobody is blaming " the Sardinian people .

Not in England , anyway . <p> Napoli remain top in Italy <p> Napoli bounced back from elimination in the Coppa Italia last week to beat Verona , 2-0 , with goals from Kalidou Koulibaly and Jose Maria Callejon . Verona are n't particularly good but equally , it was n't a game to take for granted .

In their run to the Carabao Cup final this season , they 've beaten Wolves on penalties after a 0-0 draw and progressed over two legs against Bristol City , winning 2-1 at home and 3-2 away .

@@23001239 <h> Diskerud , Harrison , NYCFC and Man City : What it means for MLS <p> New York City FC star Jack Harrison says he 's hopeful of more chances to prove himself for England after his recent experience with the under-21s . <p> New York City FC has entered a brave new world and plenty of eyes are watching . <p> The club 's majority owner is the City Football Group ( CFG ) . It owns Manchester City among others and , from the moment the Yankee Stadium-based club was established in 2013 , its relationship to the mother ship and , in particular , its Premier League club , has raised questions . Would NYCFC be a feeder team ? A dumping ground for castoffs ? Was the investment by CFG a way to skirt financial fair play ( FFP ) rules ? <p> There has never been any doubt about links between the two clubs but , for the first three years of NYCFC 's existence , the flow of players and resources was primarily in one direction : From Manchester to New York . <p> NYCFC manager Patrick Vieira arrived fresh from leading Man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players have gone to England to train during the offseason . Man City midfielder Yangel Herrera is in the midst of a two-year loan with NYCFC . <p> But in the past week , a pair of transactions has cast the relationship between the two teams in a new light . First , there was the announcement -- by apparel company Umbro , not Man City -- that U.S. international midfielder Mix Diskerud had signed a four-and-a-half-year contract with Man City . <p> Then NYCFC midfielder Jack Harrison joined Man City for a fee of around $6 million , according to ESPN FC sources , with the potential for add-ons . He was immediately loaned to Championship side Middlesbrough . <p> The Diskerud deal , which an ESPN FC source has confirmed but is yet to be publicly acknowledged by Man City , has caused head-scratching . Last year , Vieira was so eager to get rid of the midfielder that , in accordance with MLS roster rules , NYCFC exercised a buyout of the player 's contract . But the term " buyout " is something of a misnomer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the salary cap for the remainder of the contract , though NYCFC was still on the hook to pay him the approximately $1.5m he was due over the deal 's remaining two years . In March 2017 he moved on loan to Swedish club IFK Gothenburg and , when no permanent deal was forthcoming at its conclusion , his MLS contract was terminated . <p> Mix Diskerud and Jack Harrison have both moved from NYCFC to Man City , moves which have led to questions . <p> A source with knowledge of the Man City deal said that Diskerud will not train with the first team nor will he be loaned to another CFG affiliate , adding that the aim is to sell or loan him again . Meanwhile , as far as MLS is concerned , the deal complied with league rules and no competitive advantage was gained since Diskerud 's cap hit had already been handled by the buyout . <p> " The transaction was entirely consistent with our league rules , which allow teams to buy out or absorb the cost of a player 's contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " MLS executive vice-president Todd Durbin told ESPN FC . <p> Meanwhile , where Harrison is concerned , Stoke City were reported to be frontrunners for his signature , only for Man City to intervene at a reportedly lower initial fee . <p> The Diskerud and Harrison deals seem to follow the same general blueprint as that which saw Australian international midfielder Aaron Mooy join Man City in 2016 from Melbourne City -- another member of CFG -- before being loaned and later sold to Huddersfield for $14m . <p> Why do things this way ? For City , any future sale helps them comply with FFP rules although , in the case of Diskerud , his potential impact seems likely to be almost nil . Harrison has more upside . <p> The benefit for NYCFC is that its financial responsibility to Diskerud has now been removed and , per league rules , it gets to keep half the Harrison fee , though only $750,000 -- up from last year 's mark of $650,000 -- of that can be applied to the salary cap . <p> In terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinions vary . One MLS executive , who asked not to be identified , said when asked to comment on the Diskerud deal : " It 's CFG 's business . They can account for club doing that for a player that is never going to play there . " <p> MLS insists it is vigilant about ensuring there is no " blending of resources " or other financial sleight of hand when it comes to its teams with sister clubs , though that usually applies to players coming in , not those going out . The only other MLS team to which this scenario could apply is the New York Red Bulls : Red Bull GmbH also owns Austrian side Red Bull Salzburg and RB Leipzig from Germany . <p> It has always been the case that the league is duty-bound to make sure it gets fair-market value for its saleable assets , given its single-entity structure and control over player contracts .

@@23537235 <h> Hazard 's future at Chelsea looking bleaker by the day <p> LONDON -- Eden Hazard has never looked more depressed in his Chelsea career than he did for 89 minutes at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday . <p> Deployed as a false nine in a false attack against a suffocating Manchester City , granted just 32 touches of the ball and forced to jump for aimless clearances that even Olivier Giroud or Alvaro Morata could not have hoped to reach , it was little surprise when the Belgian declined to even acknowledge Antonio Conte as he trudged from the pitch . <p> After the game Hazard displayed his usual smiling , carefree demeanour , but his words revealed his true feelings . <p> " When you leave the pitch you have the impression that you 've ran , but that you have n't played a game of football , " he said . " That 's a pity . We could have played on for three hours and I would n't touch the ball . " <p> The fear of many Chelsea fans , and reportedly of many in the dressing room , is that Conte 's isolating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms of Real Madrid , the club that have always been his dream destination and finally appear ready to consummate their long-standing interest . <p> It certainly can not help , but the unpleasant truth for the Chelsea board is that the flaws in their pitch to convince Hazard to spend the rest of his prime years at Stamford Bridge go significantly beyond the tactical foibles of a coach who will almost certainly be gone in three months ' time . <p> Chelsea will remain Premier League champions in name for at least the rest of March , but for several months they have given the impression of a team at the end of a cycle . Diego Costa 's departure and the decline of Cesc Fabregas have left Hazard to shoulder a heavier burden than ever before in a less creative , more limited side , and form has cratered as a result . <p> Things need not have been this way , and you suspect the extraordinary performances of Kevin De Bruyne and Mohamed Salah in particular this season will have prompted the Chelsea hierarchy to privately reflect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Hazard certainly has ; in an interview with Copa90 last month he put his head in his hands when reminded that De Bruyne was once a Chelsea teammate , and he pointedly spoke in glowing terms of his countryman when revealing his pick for PFA Player of the Year . <p> No balance is harder to strike at the elite level of football than the one between short-term competitiveness and the longer view . Few clubs ever find it , and even the smartest can not preserve it for long . <p> That said , it has become increasingly clear that , by sacrificing two of the 10 best players in the world right now in favour of more immediate contributors , Jose Mourinho 's second spell at Stamford Bridge cost Chelsea a position of incredible strength and sustainability . <p> Roman Abramovich has not acquired a rising star of world-class potential since Salah in January 2014 , and the hyperinflation of the transfer market makes it hard to see where the next one will come from . Mourinho and Conte 's priorities also ensured that , Andreas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ academy team have either stagnated or departed . <p> All signs point to a summer rebuild with or without Hazard , but unless Chelsea finish the Premier League season like a runaway train or pull off another Champions League miracle , they will be recruiting as a Europa League club while their key domestic rivals continue to shop in the top bracket of the market . <p> At 27 years old , Hazard has no business spending a year of his prime in Europe 's second-tier competition , or being the sole superstar in a team trending backwards in the least forgiving league in the world .

@@23537237 <h> Liverpool 's first-leg lead over Porto insurmountable <p> LIVERPOOL , England -- Three quick thoughts on Liverpool 's 0-0 Champions League draw with Porto at Anfield on Tuesday , which sees the Reds move on to the Champions League quarterfinals 5-0 on aggregate . <p> 1 . Liverpool 's first-leg win put comeback out of Porto 's reach <p> On an entirely forgettable night , Liverpool reached reached the quarterfinals of the Champions League , ending their nine-year absence from that stage of the competition . <p> Holding a 5-0 advantage from the first leg , this return fixture was a procession from the first second , and there were no concerns of an improbable response from Porto , with Liverpool coming closest to scoring when Sadio Mane hit the post in the first half and substitute Danny Ings had a header saved by Iker Casillas . <p> The reward for Liverpool 's performance in Portugal last month was for the second leg to have preseason-like feel at this stage of the season . And the biggest boost resulting from it is that it appeared to be injury-free prior to the weekend 's game at Manchester United . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understatement . To get to the quarterfinals , Sergio Conceicao 's side were required to pull off one of football 's greatest ever comeback stories , while breaking a number of long-standing records in the process . <p> Klopp had a call to make with his team selection : either put out his strongest XI in the hope of maintaining rhythm or to rest players ahead of Saturday 's trip to Old Trafford . In the end , he settled for a blend of the two options , making five changes , while starting Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk on the bench . <p> Having probably made travel arrangements and bought tickets for this game well before the first leg , Porto 's travelling support made the most of their trip to Merseyside , even if their team 's performance did n't come close to the same intensity . <p> Salah eventually appeared in the 73rd minute , but by that stage his two forward partners , Mane and Roberto Firmino , were off the pitch and beginning their recovery for the United game . Liverpool 's job was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lallana 's road back blocked by Milner <p> Liverpool 's midfield has been forced to evolve in wake of Adam Lallana 's long-term absence this season . No longer is the energetic , high-pressing style that Klopp wants so dependent on Lallana being in the side . <p> Klopp had admitted the club mismanaged the 29-year-old 's return from long-term injury , rushing him back too soon . Therefore , Lallana has failed to generate any sort of rhythm in his 11 appearances in 2017-18 . His 90-minute outing against Porto was much needed , but he did n't go on to pull up any trees during it . <p> Sadio Mane Shaun Botterill/Getty Images <p> In truth , Lallana 's task on Tuesday was n't the easiest . He replaced the 32-goal Salah in Liverpool 's front three . An instant return to midfield , where he thrived last season , will be difficult . <p> James Milner continued his rich vein of form in central midfield against Porto , with his willingness , experience and versatility making him one of Liverpool 's best players in recent games . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most assists in this season 's Champions League with seven , and was continually looking to add to that tally with a number of pin-point accurate long passes . He should have had assist No. 8 for the through ball that led to Mane striking the woodwork in the 31st minute . <p> Lallana 's loss has been Milner 's gain . No longer shifted out as an auxiliary left-back , Milner is now taking centre stage . <p> 3 . Liverpool 's vast growth since Porto 's last visit <p> Football is an incredibly fast-moving business . Days feel like weeks and weeks become months . A year can appear to take the form of a decade . Liverpool as a club are virtually unrecognisable from when Porto last visited it -- back in November 2007 . <p> When the Portuguese side last played at Anfield more than 10 ago , Liverpool were in the midst of a civil war . Due to displeasure at the ownership of George Gillett and Tom Hicks , nearly 2,000 Liverpool supporters marched towards Anfield in support of then-manager Rafael Benitez . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European Cup for me , " read a banner in the Kop on Tuesday . <p> While not perfect , Liverpool are relatively settled on and off the pitch these days . It feels like it 's all beginning to click under Klopp 's management . The club 's first appearance in the quarterfinals of the Champions League since 2009 could be out-done by a runners-up finish in the Premier League this season , but Liverpool fans are starting to believe their European adventure wo n't end in the last eight . <p> Given other rivals ' struggles and Liverpool continually solidifying their place in the top four , Klopp may well be able to concentrate more on the Champions League in the closing weeks of the season . <p> Liverpool are gathering serious momentum at the business end of the campaign . It 's an entirely different story to last term when they limped over the line in fourth . Things are continually changing at Anfield -- positively these days .

But they crashed out at the round of 16 stage and suffered their first home defeat in all competitions in the process , with Real becoming the first visiting team to win at Parc des Princes ( all competitions ) since Monaco in March 2016 . <p> The implications for coach Unai Emery are likely to be serious , with the former Sevilla boss expected to lose his job at the end of the season as PSG 's Qatari owners are impatient for success beyond the club 's French borders .

But although there have been times when his pace has looked a little less sharp than it has in the past and his trademark step-overs ever so slightly slower , Ronaldo continues to be the man for the big occasion for Real . <p> This was a game that lacked quality in the first half but Ronaldo was the Real player who looked most likely to make a decisive contribution . It came not long after the break when he arrived at the far post to head Lucas Vazquez 's cross past Alphonse Areola in the PSG goal . <p> At some point , Real will have to replace their talisman but how do you replace Ronaldo ? Even when he is supposedly " sub-par , " he continues to deliver and only a fool would bet against him scoring in a 10 consecutive Champions League game when the quarterfinals begin . <p> 3 . Neymar a loss but PSG still need so much more <p> Manuel Queimadelos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absence from the PSG team will be cited as the main factor in their Champions League exit , but to suggest it was the key reason would be ignoring reality . <p> Neymar had hit 26 goals in 29 games for PSG this season before sustaining the foot injury that ruled him out of this round of 16 second-leg tie and much of the rest of the season . But while his goal threat would obviously have given PSG a sharper cutting edge , there were too many players in the home team who were simply outdone by their Real opposite number . <p> Verratti , who was sent off in the second-half , Angel di Maria , Thiago Motta and Edinson Cavani were all found wanting against Real . The list could go on , too , and although Kylian Mbappe was a constant threat , his immaturity with the ball was a problem for PSG because he repeatedly made the wrong decision when in dangerous positions . <p> Neymar was the statement signing by PSG last summer , when the ? 198 million deal with Barcelona made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not make a team .

@@23763234 <p> Evidence already shows that eating certain foods , such as garlic and fish , can only make the smell worse . <p> Now , leading dentist and bacteriologist Dr Howard Katz , founder of The Breath Company , provides a handy guide to the questions everyone has about bad breath . <p> In a piece for Get The Gloss for World Oral Health Day - which occurs every year on March 20 , he explains the causes of and cures for halitosis . <p> And Dr Katz , who trained at the University of California , Los Angeles , reveals the best ways of letting someone know they have it without risking a relationship rift . <p> Bad breath ( or halitosis to give it its proper name ) is the presence of a foul-smelling odour that is expelled from the mouth cavity . <p> Unfortunately , bad breath is all too common a complaint , with an estimated one in four people in Britain reportedly suffering from the condition on a regular basis . <p> It can be difficult to tell if you are suffering with bad breath as it is often challenging to pick up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , friends and colleagues may not feel comfortable in telling you . <p> One of the best ways to establish if you have bad breath is by checking it yourself . <p> If you feel uncomfortable about asking the opinion of a trusted friend or family member , there are a few ways in which you can test your own breath . <p> The first is ' the cotton test ' : wipe the top surface of your tongue with a piece of cotton gauze and smell it . If there 's a foul smell and a yellowish stain on the cotton , it 's likely that you have an elevated sulphide production level and bad breath . <p> You could also lick the back of your hand , leave it to dry for 5-10 seconds and then smell it , or run a piece of dental floss between your back teeth ( this is the mostly likely place where you may get food caught ) and then smell the floss . <p> This may be an indication of the level of odours others detect . You can also stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far as possible . <p> If you notice that the very back of your tongue is whitish , it may be a sign that you have bad breath . <p> The best way to truly identify the source of chronic halitosis is to visit a dentist or doctor for a professional diagnosis . <p> When you are ready to tackle this situation , be sure to be open and honest with the healthcare professional performing the examination . <p> It is important for them to understand all the health problems you are experiencing in order to determine the underlying cause and recommend appropriate treatment . <p> WHAT ARE THE MOST COMMON CAUSES OF BAD BREATH ? <p> Anyone can get bad breath , even people who are conscientious brushers and flossers . <p> It has less to do with oral hygiene and more to do with things like food you eat , medications you take and lifestyle habits that you engage in that can provide an environment favourable to anaerobic , sulphur-producing , bad breath related bacteria . <p> There are many underlying causes of bad breath , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often triggered by a lack of saliva through smoking , drinking alcohol , snoring and long periods of speaking to name but a few . <p> WHAT DOES BAD BREATH SAY ABOUT YOUR GENERAL HEALTH ? <p> It 's worth remembering that oral health is so much more than just about maintaining a great smile . <p> The mouth is the entrance to our bodies and what we put in to it and how we treat it has an inextricable link to our overall health and general wellbeing . <p> According to studies , an estimated 10 per cent of all halitosis cases are caused by certain illnesses . <p> Sinusitis , pneumonia , bronchitis , post nasal drip , and polyps affect the airways and may also contribute to the problem . <p> Other common illnesses associated with bad breath include nasal odour and tonsil stones , yeast infections of the mouth , and gum disease . <p> Certain drugs such as antidepressants , high blood pressure medications , and antihistamines can factor into dry mouth because they reduce saliva production . <p> Please note , however , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , it is important that you consult your doctor or dentist as soon as you notice consistent white spots on the tonsils and sores in the mouth with or without a fever . <p> Sometimes bad breath is triggered by severe health conditions such as throat or mouth cancers , human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection , digestive system disorders , or diabetes , and it can indicate dehydration or zinc deficiency . <p> Taking proper care of your teeth and visiting the dentist at least twice a year are the easiest ways to avoid these issues . <p> Contrary to popular belief , bad breath does not come from the stomach . <p> There is no open tube connecting the large intestine , small intestine and stomach to your oesophagus and mouth . If you burp you may release smelly digestive gas - but that is not bad breath , it 's bad gas . <p> WHAT ARE THE PRODUCTS AND INGREDIENTS TO AVOID ? <p> Some toothpastes contains sodium lauryl sulphate ( SLS ) , a soapy detergent that creates foam but has no cleaning benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects including canker sores . <p> It 's important to steer clear of alcohol-based mouthwashes as these can cause dry mouth , and just mask odours rather than killing off bacteria . <p> Regular and specific application of alcohol-free mouth rinses will help to calm the gum area and work to both eliminate germs associated with gum disease and reduce the formation of biofilm which leads to plaque and tartar build-up . <p> Clinical tests of patients treated with The Breath Company rinses repeatedly resulted in a complete elimination of over 98 per cent of the volatile sulphur compounds that cause bad breath . <p> WHAT ARE THE FOODS THAT MAKE BAD BREATH WORSE ? <p> Halitosis can be exacerbated by certain foods such as onions and garlic because they contain smelly sulphur compounds , while dairy , meat , and fish contain dense proteins which are used as a food source by the anaerobic , sulphur-producing bacteria . <p> Refined and processed sugars also provide a food source for bacteria . <p> Coffee and juices can contribute to this problem because they are acidic and provide these bacteria with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THAT CAN COMBAT BAD BREATH ? <p> Eating your five a day is really good for your oral health and high fibre foods also help to prevent halitosis . <p> Fresh produce contains vitamins and minerals that build strong and durable teeth , while other abrasive foods help to get rid of odour-causing plaque- think of it like brushing your teeth while eating . <p> Fruits and veggies that are high in vitamin C help to reduce the plaque in your mouth as well and promote gum health , reducing the risk of gingivitis . <p> Since these foods have a high water content , they promote saliva production in the mouth , which beats dry mouth and flushes away bad breath . <p> Apples , celery and carrots , alongside other fresh produce will work to ' brush ' the teeth as they contain a high level of good starch that rinses away dental plaque and are rich in vitamins and nutrients that will keep gums healthy . <p> Staying hydrated is also a key factor in keeping your mouth healthy . <p> Dehydration is caused by not drinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and can be caused by many factors including illness , sweating , excessive alcohol consumption , long-term health conditions and poor diet and exercise choices to name but a few . <p> Dehydration can cause a range of oral health issues that include dry mouth , bad breath , cavities and gingivitis . <p> You can try drinking green and black teas as they contain polyphenols that help to eliminate sulphur compounds and reduce oral bacteria . <p> Disclaimer : Opinions expressed here are those of the writers and do not reflect those of Peacefmonline.com .

This week features a forward thriving after leaving Chelsea , a Milan youth product linked with the Premier League and Stuttgart 's versatile rising star . <p> Bertrand Traore -- Lyon <p> Traore caught Lyon 's eye during a loan spell at Ajax last season when he scored twice against them in the Europa League semifinal . That prompted the Ligue 1 side to pay a reported ? 10 million to sign him from Chelsea in the summer , with Traore playing a key role in the club 's battle for a Champions League place this term . <p> Playing style <p> An inverted right forward , Traore likes to cut inside to open up space around the penalty area and angle shots towards goal on his favoured left foot . <p> He is composed in possession , basing his game on close control rather than speed , and will often drop deep to allow the full-back to overlap down the wing . <p> A languid dribbler , Traore takes his time to pick a pass or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose the ball too easily but is diligent in his defensive duties , tracking back to help Lyon maintain a compact shape . <p> Form <p> With 12 goals in 35 appearances , Traore has proved to be another shrewd investment for Lyon .

@@23798236 <h> Rush : Salah scoring spree down to confidence <p> LIVERPOOL , England -- " To tell you the truth , you feel invincible , " says Ian Rush . Rush is one of very few people qualified to assess Mohamed Salah 's frame of mind during his record-breaking first season at Liverpool . <p> Salah 's 36 goals in all competitions so far this season are 11 shy of Rush 's club record for the number of goals scored in a single campaign . Rush netted 47 times in 65 appearances in 1983-84 , helping Joe Fagan 's Liverpool win the European Cup , First Division and League Cup . <p> " I think it 's all down to confidence , " Rush told ESPN FC , speaking to promote Liverpool Legends ' match with Bayern Munich on Saturday . " I think when you 're playing so well like that , you go out knowing you 're going to score . <p> " When you 're on a high , you try everything . You try ridiculous things , with your left foot , your right foot , with your head -- everything . <p> " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try them things . I think that 's the difference when you 're in a purple patch like that . You 're willing to try everything because you know nine times out of 10 that it will come off . <p> " You just ca n't wait to get out there because you know you 're going to get a chance and if you get a chance you 're most probably going to score . That 's what happens . " <p> That excitement to get out and play transcends onto the training ground too , according to Rush , despite the obvious risk of picking up injuries that can , ultimately , impact a player 's momentum . <p> " I think in training you 're exactly the same , " Rush said . " You go out there with confidence and all that . If you think about getting injured then you will get injured . <p> " Off the pitch as well , you feel really comfortable doing everything . You take that into training . <p> " I 've heard some of the Liverpool players say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not just in the games . That comes across to me that he 's in a purple patch . " <p> A lot of footballers are creatures of habit , taking up , in some cases , bizarre routines in the belief that a winning or scoring run would be maintained . Rush was no different . His superstition was born partway through the 1983-84 season when Luton Town arrived to Anfield . <p> Mohamed Salah Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty Images <p> " When you get superstitions , that 's it , " he said . " My boots were rock hard before the game and I just wet my boots . <p> " I scored five goals and we won 6-0 . Ever since then , I wet my boots . Even now when I play in Legends games , I still wet my boots before . <p> " I do n't know whether Mo has any superstitions himself , but everyone has their own ins and outs . " <p> With Liverpool having seven Premier League games remaining in the season and at least two more in the Champions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salah breaks Rush 's long-standing feat . <p> " Even when I broke Roger Hunt 's record , he told me that records are there to be broken , " Rush , Liverpool 's all-time top scorer with 346 goals , conceded . " Of course you want to hold on to your records , but being connected with Liverpool Football Club now , you do n't mind them being broken because that means they 're doing well . <p> " Maybe a difference is that when I scored 47 goals , we won three trophies . That 's what we 've got to start doing now . <p> " It 's great having individual trophies , but in my 47-goal season we won three trophies . I 'm more pleased that we won three trophies than I did scoring 47 goals . " <p> Rush 's remarkable season was no outlier . He followed up the 1983-84 season with 26 goals in 44 appearances in 1984-85 and then recorded goal-scoring returns of 33 and 40 respectively in the two seasons after that . <p> In order for Salah to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Rush concluded : " You keep looking to improve yourself every time . <p> " You know next season people will be looking out for you . People will be out there saying : ' If you stop Salah from playing then you stop Liverpool from playing and winning . ' <p> " You 're always looking to improve each season because the opposition will be doing exactly the same . If you ca n't add one or two things to your makeup then you 're not going to do that .

@@23894230 <h> Seven ways to prevent snoring <p> Many of us snore at least some of the time , but it can be damaging for health and relationships . <p> Shut your mouth <p> We are designed so we breathe in and out through the nose . If you sleep with your mouth open , incoming air hits the soft tissue at the back of the throat and makes it vibrate , creating that characteristic noise . About 45% of adults snore sometimes , and 25% snore regularly -- and mouth breathing is the most common cause . Some 10% of children snore , too , often due to enlarged adenoids that shrink by the age of seven . But while kids grow out of snoring , adults tend to get worse . You can try to keep your mouth shut with a chin strap that loops under the chin and over your head , or a mouth guard . <p> Open your nose <p> If your nasal passages are open , you are less likely to mouth-breathe or snore . Sterimar is a salt water spray , available over the counter , that washes out any nasal gunk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away allergens and dust . Steroid nasal sprays and antihistamines can help nasal congestion caused by allergies . Alcohol and smoking cause nasal congestion ; if you ca n't quit , try not to smoke in the four hours before you go to sleep and limit alcohol to two days a week . You may have a structural obstruction such as a deviated nasal septum from an old injury ; press hard on one side of the nose and breathe in with your mouth shut , if the other side of the nose collapses inwards and air ca n't get through then you 've got an obstruction . Nasal strips that you tape across the nose or dilators that sit inside the blocked nostril may help . Surgery called a septoplasty ( or " nose job " ) straightens the nose and tries to reopen the nasal passages . <p> Weigh it up <p> A fat neck makes you snore by compressing the airways . Men store excess fat around the neck more than women , so they tend to snore more . Any man with a shirt collar size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Women with short , fat necks often snore , too . Losing weight will help if neck fat is the main problem . <p> Check your jaw <p> A receding jaw ( retrognathia ) can contribute to snoring as the tongue is more likely to fall back and obstruct the airway when you sleep . To check whether you have retrognathia , bite together on your back teeth ; if your lower teeth are markedly behind the upper ones ( overbite ) , then retrognathia is a distinct possibility . A mandibular advancement device may help . It is a hinged gadget that fits over the teeth and pushes the lower jaw forward . You can buy a cheap one online to check whether you can bear to wear one all night . Orthodontists can make bespoke ( and potentially expensive ) ones and NHS snoring clinics provide them free of charge . <p> Back off <p> It 's best to sleep on your side , not your back . You can buy a pillow that aims to prop you up on your side or try the old-fashioned trick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your pyjamas . The problem with the tennis ball idea is that many of us do n't have PJs and ca n't sew , and anyway it disturbs your sleep by waking you up when you lie flat . A swift kick or sharp prod from an exasperated partner works in a similar way . <p> Get a diagnosis <p> Obstructive sleep apnoea ( OSA ) happens when your throat closes completely and you stop breathing for 10 seconds or more . Oxygen levels in the blood fall and the brain restarts breathing ; often with a jolt , gasp or grunt . OSA is bad for health ; it is associated with daytime sleepiness which can lead to accidents , high blood pressure , increased risk of stroke , diabetes and depression . You can do an online test to check whether you are at risk , download an app such as SnoreLab and see your GP for referral to a snoring clinic . <p> Rent , buy or wait for a CPAP pump <p> Moderate to severe OSA is most effectively treated by continuous positive airways pressure ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply of compressed air into your nose and mouth through a mask to prevent your throat from closing .

If it does , you can wait and get a CPAP free on the NHS , or consider buying one .

Chubb was instead selected fifth by the Denver Broncos , where he will play alongside Von Miller , the Super Bowl 50 most valuable player . <p> This was the first NFL draft held in a stadium . Roughly two-thirds of the Dallas Cowboys ' AT&amp;T Stadium was cordoned off and left vacant , while thousands poured into the remaining section , from the chairs set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Accompanied by his fianc ? e , he walked to the podium with a pronounced limp . <p> After the Broncos took Chubb at No. 5 , Indianapolis selected Quenton Nelson , a guard from Notre Dame , who Colts fans hope will help protect quarterback Andrew Luck , who is still working his way back from a shoulder injury . <p> The Bills ' selection of Allen , who earlier in the day apologized for racially insensitive tweets he had sent several years ago , was followed by the Chicago Bears ' nabbing Georgia linebacker Roquan Smith and the San Francisco 49ers ' picking offensive tackle Mike McGlinchey , the second Notre Dame lineman to go in the top 10 . <p> But the Browns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second round Friday night ( thanks to a trade that helped the Philadelphia Eagles net their starting quarterback , Carson Wentz , in 2016 ) , were unquestionably the central players of the draft .

Government <p> One post read , " to embark a new journey for Africa to embrace the 4th industrial revolutions for the youth . The aim of the project is to create thousands of jobs and brings billions of investments to Togo . " <p> A few minutes later , another followed , which stated , " This is a physical letter signed by the Prime Minister of Togo , hand delivered to us minutes before we stepped onto the plane , from a meeting merely a day ago . " ( The image , no longer available on Twitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> The letter mentioned a proposed partnership through which Binance and the Togolese government would " engage Togo in the fourth industrial revolution " by " developing training programs for the youth to create many jobs for them and attracting important investments . " <p> Considering that news of this partnership follows at least one meeting between Zhao and Togo 's president , and in light of Zhao 's suggestion that Togo could receive billions of dollars ' worth of investments as a result , it seems quite likely that Binance 's activities in the country will have an additional effect : propping up the presidency of Faure Gnassingb ? . This is because , as a partner on the project , the government will presumably have some discretion over at least some of the associated funds . <h> The Political Context <p> Togo , a small country of under 8 million , has been under Gnassingb ? rule for over 50 years , beginning with a military takeover in 1967 by Gnassingb ? Eyad ? ma , who held power ( at least in part through the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2005 . <p> During the power struggle that ensued after his death , some 400 to 500 were killed and thousands of others were injured , according to UN figures , and Togolese refugees in neighboring Ghana and Benin came to number over 30,000 . <p> In the end , the late president 's son Faure emerged as the new head of state . <p> 2017 saw a renewed wave of protests , with demonstrators calling for Gnassingb ?

After more than 10 years in power , Gnassingb ? appeared intent to follow the example of his father , who had scrapped the law and remained in office in spite of the limit . Demonstrations continued after it was proposed that the term limit be applied to Gnassingb ? ' s presidency beginning in 2020 , which would have allowed him to stay in power until as late as 2030 . " Hundreds of thousands " of protestors reportedly participated . <p> In July , before anti-Gnassingb ? actions had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceremony intended to appease the spirits of activists who had been killed over the years , including , apparently , some 28 individuals slain in the early 1990s .

Toward the end of the year , hundreds of Togolese once again sought refuge in Ghana . <p> ETHNews was unable to confirm the authenticity of social media reports , accompanied by gory images , which claim that government violence against protesters has continued through April 2018 . <h> Why the Partnership Matters <p> In some cases , regimes lacking widespread popular support have been able to maintain power through cash injections from outside business interests . Though Zhao has predicted that Binance 's work in Togo will be a boon to the country 's population , his assessment is not likely to sit well with those Togolese who have been clamoring for an end to the decades-long Gnassingb ? dynasty . <p> The majority of commenters who responded to Zhao 's Togo tweets rhapsodized over the announcement .

He did not make it to the second inning . <h> DeGrom almost pitched last Monday , before the Mets , who overhauled their medical practices in the offseason after another injury-plagued season , decided to be more cautious . That attitude apparently guided the Mets ( 19-18 ) again Sunday , when they pulled deGrom after just one laborious inning of a 4-2 loss to the Philadelphia Phillies . <p> " I was kind of surprised , honestly , " deGrom said . " I definitely would 've liked to go back out there . The reasoning , I understand , but who wants to pitch one inning as a starter ? " <p> While the Mets have been cautious with deGrom , they have allowed their most powerful hitter , left fielder Yoenis Cespedes , to play through right quadriceps discomfort . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he moved gingerly after beating out an infield hit and after catching a ball in the outfield . <p> In the end , the Mets lost because of a seventh-inning , three-run home run by pinch-hitter Nick Williams , a left-handed hitter , off Paul Sewald , a right-handed relief pitcher in his second inning of work . The Mets had Jerry Blevins , a left-hander , warming up the bullpen , and he ultimately did not appear in the game . It was the Mets ' ninth loss in 11 games . <p> " We had to get Blevins going in case we were in dire need , and Paul looked like he was struggling , " manager Mickey Callaway said . " I did n't feel like that was the case . " <p> Rain delayed Sunday 's game an hour . A combination of deGrom 's uneven command and the pesky Phillies hitters pushed his first-inning pitch count to 45 . He walked the first three batters to load the bases , and the Phillies fouled off 20 pitches . <p> DeGrom did not allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strikeouts and a putout at home plate . After that , Callaway turned the game over to the bullpen .

Perhaps fearing the potential reaction over the uncertainty , the Mets announced that deGrom was not removed because of an injury but rather as a precaution , citing the high pitch count and rain delay . Later , Callaway pointed to the recent disabled list stint . <p> " We did n't feel good sending him back out , " Callaway said . " We ca n't do that to anybody . That 's a lot of pitches for one inning . " <p> There was undoubtedly going to be some rust for deGrom , who last pitched in a game on May 2 , when he hyperextended his right elbow when he struck out at the plate . <p> Examinations on deGrom 's elbow , which has undergone two surgeries , showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his next start . But the Mets switched gears last weekend because they deemed it not worth the risk and wanted their best pitcher to throw a long bullpen session . Command , and not health , was his undoing Sunday . <p> DeGrom said he would have liked to hone his command in a second inning , but admitted throwing 45 pitches in one inning " might be harder " than 100 in an entire start . <p> After dealing with many injuries over the previous three seasons , the Mets beefed up their medical operation . Injuries are unavoidable in a 162-game season , and the Mets have had several already : third baseman Todd Frazier ( hamstring strain ) ; relief pitchers Anthony Swarzak ( oblique strain ) and Hansel Robles ( knee sprain ) ; and catchers Travis d'Arnaud ( Tommy John surgery ) and Kevin Plawecki ( fractured hand ) . <p> The Mets said they have been proactive in some cases : with deGrom and with Frazier , who went on the disabled list soon after minor hamstring discomfort worsened last week .

Three entertainment reporters who spoke to CNN said Freeman made inappropriate remarks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journalists who cover new films , typically attended by the movie 's biggest stars . <p> One of the three , CNN entertainment reporter Chloe Melas , the co-author of this article , says she was subjected to inappropriate behavior by Freeman more than a year ago , when she interviewed him at a press junket for " Going in Style . " According to Melas , who was six months pregnant at the time , Freeman , in a room full of people , including his co-stars Arkin and Caine , shook Melas ' hand , not letting go while repeatedly looking her up and down and saying more than once a variation of , " I wish I was there . " She says he also said to her , " You are ripe . " Cameras were on and recording during one of Freeman 's remarks to Melas -- " Boy , do I wish I was there " -- but not for the rest . As is common practice with such junkets , Melas was the only CNN employee there at the time . <p> Afterward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who instructed her to inform CNN human resources . According to Melas , she was told that CNN HR contacted their counterparts at human resources for Warner Bros. , which produced and distributed the movie , and which like CNN is owned by Time Warner . Melas said she was also told that Warner Bros . HR could not corroborate the account because only one of Freeman 's remarks was on video and the Warner Bros. employees present did not notice anything . Melas and her supervisor agreed that she would not cover the movie . <p> Asked for comment , a spokesperson for Warner Bros. confirmed that what Melas was told was accurate , but declined to comment further . A representative for Caine declined to comment . A representative for Arkin said he was not available for comment . <p> After the encounter with Freeman , Melas started making calls to see if other women had experienced anything similar , or whether this was an isolated incident . She soon learned that other women had similar stories -- and so she , and later her co-author , began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Freeman and Lori McCreary founded Revelations Entertainment in 1996 . Variety reported last year that Freeman started the company with McCreary because he was frustrated by the lack of choice roles for black actors and because he wanted to reveal the truth about serious issues -- a mission that inspired the name " Revelations . " <p> The company 's credits include a list of ambitious films about religion , apartheid , astronomy and stem cell research . Revelations also produced the film " Along Came a Spider " and the hit CBS show " Madam Secretary , " both of which feature strong female leads . <p> Morgan Freeman and Lori McCreary , his business partner , speak at an event in New York City in 2016 . <p> But former staffers who spoke with CNN say that behind the fa ? ade of a progressive and artistic agenda the company 's two founders created what one called a " toxic " work environment . Six former staffers said they witnessed Freeman 's questionable behavior around women , which they said included sexual comments and one said included an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was the target of sexual comments by Freeman . <p> The female former employee at Revelations told CNN that Freeman was flanked by a group of men on the set of " Through the Wormhole " when she met the actor for the first time . He " looked me up and down , " she said , and then asked her , " How do you feel about sexual harassment ? " <p> " I was stunned , " she told CNN . " This is the person that I worked for , this is his company , I did n't expect it at all ... I said timidly , ' I love it ' in a sarcastic way hoping to make light of the situation because I was so confused and then he turned to the guys on the crew ... and said , ' See guys , this is how you do it . ' " <p> One woman who was a manager at Revelations told CNN that sometimes Freeman would " come over to my desk to say hi and he 'd just stand there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breasts . " <p> " If I ever passed him he would stare at me in an awkward way , would look me up and down sometimes stopping and just staring , " she said . " One time he stopped , looked me up and down as I walked into a room of people , and everyone burst out laughing . And I literally froze feeling very uncomfortable and one of the people in the office said , ' Do n't worry , that 's just Morgan . ' " <p> " That sort of interaction was when I stopped wearing a skirt around the office when he was there , " said the former manager . " I ca n't say it was an accident that I 'd be wearing a potato sack and a ponytail on certain days when he was there and do my best to avoid him when he was in the office . " <p> Freeman was not in the office on a daily basis , the former employees said . But when he did show up , he behaved like a " creepy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employee . " One time I witnessed Morgan walk up to an intern and start massaging her " shoulder , he said . " The intern got visibly red and wiggled out of his grasp , it was awkward . " The incident stood out to him because Freeman was using only one hand to touch the intern , as his other was injured in a 2008 car accident that was widely covered by the press . Another former employee told CNN she was present when the male former employee told several people about this incident shortly after it occurred . <p> CNN spoke to two male witnesses who each saw a separate occasion in which Freeman asked women to twirl . One instance occurred at the office , while another happened at an off-site company event . <p> Another incident stood out to people who spoke with CNN who witnessed it . Two former staffers who were there , and a writer for the show " Madam Secretary " who also attended , each described the scene to CNN . <p> For his 79th birthday , Revelations threw Freeman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , roughly 30 people attended the party , some of whom were new to the company and had never met the actor . McCreary was among those in attendance , the sources said . <p> People at the party had to stand in a circle , a former executive at the company who attended the party told CNN , and tell Freeman who they were and what they did . Then , the former executive said , Freeman went up to women in the circle and would " stand maybe within an inch of their face and just look them up and down and not say anything , and then would move on to the next woman and he 'd stand like within an inch of their face and look them up and down and not say anything , and it was really , really strange . " The former executive added , " It was really weird and he did it to every woman but of course he did n't do it to any of the men . He did n't speak to any of the men . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the party said , " We saw Morgan go around to the girls in the circle and get really close to their faces , he did n't do it to the men . I do n't know what he said but we all thought it was strange and could n't wait to get the hell out of there . Absolutely there were sexual undertones to it . " After the #MeToo movement began , the same writer said , writers on the show joked -- with that incident in mind -- " that Morgan would be the next person to be called out . " <p> McCreary herself has also been the subject of demeaning comments by Freeman . In front of what was reportedly an audience of 400 people at 2016 's Produced By conference , Freeman described what she was wearing during their first meeting , saying , " She had on a dress cut to here . " <p> " She wants to be thought of as serious , " said Freeman of McCreary , who was on the same panel . " But you ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Freeman stood by his comments when he appeared a few days later on the " Today " show and host Savannah Guthrie said some people were " surprised " by the remarks he made on the panel . <p> " It was just something I said in jest about when I first met her , it was more than 20 years ago , " he said to Guthrie . " How is that news ? " <p> The Hollywood Reporter reported at the time that McCreary " did not visibly react to the comment . " One of the former Revelations executives told CNN that McCreary was visibly upset when she returned to the office . <p> " I tried to console her and she was clearly upset and I think she was surprised and found it hurtful and embarrassing , " said the former executive . " She was devastated . " <p> Five sources told CNN that there was no formal human resources department at Revelations at the time . There was a rotation of executives who served as the point of contact for HR issues , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior personnel about their workplace grievances . This prompted some staffers to form a " survivors club " where they gathered to vent about their experiences at Revelations , according to five sources who have been to the gatherings , which take place outside of the office . <p> Publicly , McCreary champions the #MeToo and Time 's Up movements . Two days before January 's Screen Actors Guild awards , at which Freeman accepted a Lifetime Achievement Award , McCreary released a statement on behalf of the Producers Guild of America ( PGA ) , to say that its board ratified new anti-sexual harassment guidelines for its members . " The PGA is indebted to Time 's Up as a resource in creating our protocols , " she said in a press release issued with her co-president Gary Lucchesi , referring to the initiative aimed at fighting harassment and discrimination against women . <p> Yet the former Revelations employee who said Freeman asked her how she felt about sexual harassment also alleged that on a phone call with a member of PGA , McCreary said of a candidate vying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never be able to do a good job , she has a family . " <p> Two former senior level Revelations employees said McCreary would openly mock women who had to leave work early for family commitments and school functions . McCreary also allegedly said that some employees could n't handle big workloads because they had to " run home " to their families and therefore could n't stay late at work , according to one of the sources . She openly advocated for work-life balance , that source said , but she would make " snide " remarks to those who left work early . <p> A spokesperson for the PGA said in a statement , " The Producers Guild of America is an Equal Opportunity Employer that does not question or consider marital or parental status in its hiring practices . As soon as CNN notified us about the allegation , we investigated the matter and have found that it has no merit . Lori McCreary is an outstanding PGA President . In all of her work with the Guild , she has been a consistent , vocal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underrepresented in our community . " <p> A spokesperson for McCreary did not respond to repeated follow-up requests for comment regarding the allegations against McCreary . <p> On set <p> One of the former male Revelations employees recounted to CNN what he called the " shocking " remarks that Freeman made while he was on set for a number of Freeman 's movies . What he says he witnessed follows the pattern described by the women who said they were harassed by Freeman . <p> " He 'd say things like ' I 'd like to have an hour with her ' or make vulgar and sexual comments about women , " the former employee said . " He would be verbally inappropriate and it was just shocking . You 're more shocked than anything because it 's hard to have the wherewithal to say to him ' That 's inappropriate . ' You 're just like ' whoa . ' It 's hard because on any set he is the most powerful person on it . It 's weird because you just do n't expect it from Morgan Freeman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production assistant ( PA ) mentioned at the beginning of this story who worked on " Going In Style " said she was in her early 20s when Freeman , then 78 years old , harassed her . She said the experience led to her decision to leave the movie industry . <p> " It was constant comments about the way I looked , " she said , adding that Freeman often made the comments within earshot of others on the production staff . She said she frequently came home from work in tears . <p> The woman recalled a time when she went to the set wearing a dress with a t-shirt over it to cover her exposed back , but " Morgan said to me that I should n't be wearing the shirt over my dress . " <p> Another female production assistant who witnessed this particular alleged incident told CNN that Freeman 's behavior towards the younger female production staff was an unchecked and persistent issue during filming . Both women said the t-shirt incident took place in front of a group of people and that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that particular comment . The behavior was discussed among the women he targeted , the female production assistant said . <p> A third woman who worked on a recent movie of Freeman 's recalled an incident at the film 's wrap party . " He was looking at my breasts , and I told him , ' My eyes are up here . ' Then we went to take a group photo and he pressed himself up against me . It was inappropriate . " <p> CNN spoke to one of the woman 's colleagues on the film , who said that as soon as the photo was taken , the woman walked over and told a group of people what Freeman had done to her . <p> Another production assistant , who worked with Freeman on " The Dark Knight , " told CNN that although she was never personally targeted by Freeman , she witnessed some inappropriate comments Freeman made to female members of the crew . She also said that female members of the crew would at times discuss how Freeman had made them feel uncomfortable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older more established person can get away with because they have that power , " she told CNN . " They ca n't be replaced , but you can be replaced very easily , that 's just kind of the dynamic on set . PA 's can be replaced , grips can be replaced , electricians can be replaced , but the actors -- once they 're in , they 're in . Had it been somebody else on the crew ... I would feel comfortable reporting them because I would n't feel like my job would be in danger by reporting them , but if you report somebody like Morgan Freeman that the movie would lose a lot of money by replacing them or getting them in trouble , then you 're the trouble maker and you 'll get fired because you 're just a PA . " <p> With reporters <p> Freeman 's alleged fixation on how women dressed was apparent when he hit the road to promote his films , as was his alleged pattern of looking women up and down while making sexually suggestive comments to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WGN-TV , Tyra Martin spent hours interviewing Freeman at various press junkets . Over the course of a decade , she said , she sat down with him at least nine times and grew accustomed to his comments about her appearance . But Martin made it clear in an interview with CNN that she was always " in on the joke . " WGN produced videos featuring some of Freeman 's remarks to Martin , describing it as him flirting with her . But Martin felt that one incident crossed a line . <p> " When I stood up , I pulled my skirt part of my dress down and he did say , ' Oh , do n't pull it down now . ' " Martin said . " That gave me pause but I never felt uncomfortable . " <p> It is unclear whether video of that incident exists . <p> An entertainment reporter who is a member of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association said Freeman made comments about her skirt and her legs during two different junkets . Much like many of the women in this report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reporter said Freeman 's fame and power kept her from speaking out . <p> " I was just trying to do my job and I brushed it off , " said the reporter , who did not want to be identified for this story because she 's fearful of losing out on interviews with other celebrities . <p> " You do n't want to put him on the spot because one , he 's famous and two , it 's on camera and three , you just want to do your job .

@@25124235 <p> Former Finance Minister , Seth E. Terkper , has urged the nation to continue focusing on building the Sinking Fund with oil cash with a view to retiring maturing debts . <p> In his view , the Sinking Fund will help the economy reduce the debt stock , interest rates as well as improve overall yields and sovereign ratings . He therefore expressed his concerns that the Fund has been allowed to accumulate over US$800million since 2017 without utilization , as was the case in 2015 and 2016 . <p> " We must continue to build the Sinking Fund from the additional crude oil and gas revenues from the Sankofa and Tweneboa Enyenra Ntomme ( TEN ) fields in order to make our economy 's fast-growing public debt more sustainable , " he said . <p> The Sinking Fund , which was established under Mr. Terkper 's reign as Finance Minister , requires the allocation of a percentage of oil revenue from the Stabilization Fund in order to retire the nation 's domestic and foreign bonds so as to avoid debt default or refinancing at high interest rate . <p> " Using a combination of measures such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amortization to extend tenor or maturity periods meant that by the end of 2016 , we had projected that , we should be able to , on average , ' buy-back ' up to three quarters of our foreign sovereign bonds from the Sinking Fund to ease the pressure on the debt stock , " he said . <p> He argued that there is sufficient legal backing for the measures under the Constitution , the Petroleum Revenue Management Act ( PRMA ) and the Public Financial Management Act ( PFMA ) . <p> Speaking with t media on a wide-range of issues regarding the development of new models of retiring the country 's external debt under his " smart borrowing " initiative , Mr. Terkper said : " Ghana appears to have had its back against the wall but we can point the right signals to the capital markets through these appropriate policies . The buyback and refinancing of Ghana 's first 2007 Sovereign Bond and , ultimately , the debt management provisions hold the key to making Ghana 's fast-growing public debt more sustainable . " <p> Explaining the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past administration , Mr. Terkper said it was to ensure the retiring of maturing debts which were becoming a ' headache ' because " we did n't have a plan for retiring domestic and foreign bonds in the period before the new Debt Management measures . " <p> According to Mr. Terkper , the nation had used over US$350 million of oil proceeds from only the Jubilee Fields to retire its sovereign bonds . <p> Currently , according to the PRMA reports submitted to Parliament , the Sinking Fund has accrued about US$850 million due largely to the recent increase in crude oil prices as well as additional production of oil and gas from the Tweneboa Enyenra Ntomme ( TEN ) and Sankofa oil fields . <p> " If we had continued using our Sinking Fund alone , we would be able to reduce our external bonds or use it to complement our liability management strategy . My problem about not utilizing the Sinking Fund is that , we are holding US$850 million which we should have used to mitigate our external debt , " he said . <p> Stabilisation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flows into the Sinking Fund and subsequent use of same to " buy-back " the sovereign bonds are based on capping the Stabilization Fund and channelling the annual excess flows into debt and contingency management , as required by the Petroleum Revenue Management Act ( PRMA ) . <p> " The combined Sinking Fund and ' Buy-Back ' programme means that Ghana was gradually lowering the ' roll-over ' risk associated with its long-standing ' interest-only ' loan payment policy for bills and bonds . The nation is on course to replace them with gradual redemption of the principal element of these so-called ' bullet ' loans , " Mr. Terkper said . <p> He explained that the Stabilization Fund itself was set-up under the PRMA as a conditional or rules-based savings account to provide a buffer for the budget by minimizing the adverse impact of deficits on the economy . <p> According to Mr. Terkper , in the 2015 and 2016 financial years , as crude oil prices fell , the country tapped into this Stabilisation Fund and utilized over US$250million to augment budget revenues , adding that : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postponing consumption , especially the build-up that saw the Fund accumulating over US$500 million between late 2011 and 2014 during the crude oil price boom , this outcome justifies the precautionary steps that nations take to save for a ' rainy day ' . <p> Major measures used to pay down the 2017 and other Bonds <p> The country reached a major milestone on October 4 , 2017after using US$200 million of its own oil and gas resources from a Sinking Fund account as well as proceeds from previous Bond issues to " buyback " or redeem the last instalment of the first 10-year Sovereign Bond issued in 2007 . <p> The decision to progressively retire the US$750 million bond before maturity -- with a package of " buyback " and refinancing strategies -- was taken in 2013 , as part of the Home Grown policy . This Bond was also the first to be issued on a foreign capital market by a sub-Saharan African nation , besides South Africa . <p> Cabinet and Parliament approved the retirement of the 2007 Bond as part of the 2014 Budget to avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Back then , Ghana faced significant " roll-over " risks since it did not set up a plan to repay the principal sum under the Bond 's half-yearly " interest-only " payment or " bullet " structure . <p> In the absence of a fiscal plan to create reserves to repay the principal sum when it fell due on October 4 , 2017 , investors expected Ghana to go to the markets to raise funds to refinance or roll-over the Bond at a punitive interest rate . <p> This was becoming difficult because of continuing fall in commodity prices , huge fiscal overruns from subsidies and wages , and stoppage of gas supply from Nigeria . The need for a progressive plan in the new Debt Management Strategy ( DMS ) to retire the Bond fully on due date became imperative . <p> Sinking Fund and Buyback : <p> The Sinking Fund flows used to retire part of the Bond was from oil revenues in the Stabilization Fund set up under the Petroleum Revenue Management Act ( PRMA ) , ( Amendment ) 2015 ( Act 893 ) . Further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fund transfer into a Debt Service Reserve ( DSR ) account for retiring Bonds to support debt repayment and improve yields . <p> Overall , Ghana had used US$336 million of the Sinking Fund by December 2016 to buyback the 2007 and other domestic and foreign debt . <p> Refinancing : Ghana also used US$100 million of the 2014 and US$216 million of the 2016 Bond proceeds to augment the retirement of the 2007 Bond , through a liability management or exchange plan for its new and old bonds . It is important to note that the bulk of the amount for overall domestic and foreign debt exchange and " buyback " came from the US$1billion worth of Bond that the World Bank guaranteed in 2015 . ' <p> Soft-amortization : At end-2016 , Ghana 's last " bullet " was the 2013 Bond . Those of 2014 to 2016 fall under a soft-amortization plan -- under which , instead of the 1-year " bullet " payment , the maturity periods were extended by 3-to-5 years . This is to enable Ghana redeem/buyback or refinance the principal sum gradually from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been able to extend the maturity for the 2014 to 2016 bonds to 2030 and expects to cover 75 percent or more of the annual average obligation of US$300 million from the Sinking Fund and flows from commercial projects under the DSR 's " self-financing " plan . <p> Other Debt Management Policies <p> Mr. Terkper observed that the nation had averted the general notion that it would also had devoted proceeds from the oil resources to consumption only ; learning from the advanced and middle-income countries , what also matters are effective debt management and a infrastructure development the latter through the setting up of the Ghana Infrastructure and Investment Fund ( GIIF ) . <p> " We must augment the Sinking Fund with other measures , notably the ' self-financing ' strategy that requires that we repay loans from the revenues generated by commercial projects and not put the burden on the taxpayer .

@@25212235 <h> Nurses , doctors do not manufacture beds <p> Once again Ghana woke up to a sad news of the passing on of a 70-year-old Ghanaian after an inability to admit him in seven hospitals in Accra for reason of " no bed " . This is indeed an unfortunate occurrence hence I extend my condolence to the breathed family for their loss . Unfortunately , several Ghanaians have narrated their ordeal on this phenomenon of " no-bed " in some hospitals in Ghana including the Hon. Member of Parliament for Timpani who equally narrated the circumstances under which his beloved wife died because of same . <p> Sincerely , the " no-bed syndrome " is unacceptable and unfortunate hence should not be allowed to linger in our Health service delivery systems . The unfortunate death of the 70-year-old has triggered policymakers to take steps to perform an exploratory fact-finding mission on the subject of " no-bed " in hospitals . <p> The first was the Director General of Ghana health services Dr. Anthony Asare ( GHS ) who tasked a committee to look into the matter and deliver a report within 10 days . <p> The second was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Criminalization of no-bed syndrome and again asking the Committee on Health in Parliament to explore laws that will criminalise the " no bed syndrome " . <p> A deputy Minister of Health Mrs Hawa Koomson has also indicated government 's intention to procure 275 Ambulances to tackle our health care emergencies in this country . Unfortunately , some individuals have resorted to social media like Facebook to as usual blame Nurses and Doctors for the " no-bed syndrome " even when the GHS has just commenced investigations into the issue . <p> The reaction of policymakers and some individuals to this issue may sound prompt and superb , but I think that we are pressing the wrong button . Fact is , Nurses and Doctors do not manufacture beds , and neither do they procure or establish health Institutions . It is solely the responsibility of Government to do so . Why are we pretending as a country not to know the causes of the " no-bed syndrome " . According to Experts , a syndrome is a problem or phenomenon which cause can not be understood . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we are being palliative or better still- economic with the truth . I may admit some level of negligence of some health workers in some hospitals , however , a chunk of the blame should be put to the doorstep of government for failing to provide healthcare facilities that are commensurate with the population of growth of the country . We should n't expect almost the same number of health facilities and health workers to be able to take care of a population that grows in hundreds each day . <p> Successive governments have done their bid to augment the existing health facilities and health workers in this country by establishing more hospitals and increasing intake into health training institutions respectively . These interventions have yielded the establishment hospitals like University of Ghana Medical Center and the increase in the number of graduate health professional . <p> Just as we know we have a deficit in terms of health facilities , we should be seen as a country to as a matter of urgency prioritize health over any other business . Unfortunately , we are as usual playing partisan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University of Ghana Medical Center not operating simply because of some excuse or the other ?

Why should it be so easy to direct health workers not to turn Patients away when we ca n't tell the government to establish more facilities , commission the completed and employ the teaming graduate healthcare professionals who are eager to deliver healthcare services ? The directive to criminalize " no-bed " in hospitals in Ghana can only be a good one if such a directive is directed at the one responsible for providing the beds -- in this case , government . <p> It is not for a joke that every hospital has a bed capacity , this is to ensure the quality of care in our institutions .

Imagine a hospital that has admitted patients on the floor ; how can the Nurses and Doctors work with their trollies ? How can essential medical equipment like suctioning machines , oxygen cylinders be moved around the wards to patients who need them ? How can proper cleaning of the wards be done. ? How can we maintain an effective infection prevention and control practices ? <p> It is not for fun that hospital beds are designed with special accessories that allow for adjustments or manipulations such raising the head-end of the bed , lowering or raising the foot end of the bed , side rails etc . These engineering are to help in caring for patients who need a particular type of bed at a particular time .

@@25226230 <h> Undoing the legacy of 1913 Land Act <p> On this day in 1913 the Native Land Act was passed into law . It was an evil piece of legislation that prevented black South Africans from owning or buying land outside of ' native reserves ' , which were overcrowded , unsuited for farming , and remote . The Act was the precursor for a raft of legislation that continued this dispossession , including the ' homelands ' policy and the Group Areas Act . The painful social and economic legacy of the Native Land Act remains with South Africa still . Land ownership is still severely skewed , black families are still largely asset poor and remain unable to build savings and wealth . This is the legacy that the DA seeks to undo every single day . <p> This legacy can and must be righted . While other parties talk about it , the DA in government is delivering real , meaningful urban property ownership that is undoing the legacy of the 1913 Land Act . Norah Motshelane , Sidodo Mazondo and Aubrey Mketsu 's family stories are examples of how this can begin to be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lufhereng , Soweto today , which was an uplifting reminder of what real freedom looks like when you own the land that you live on . <p> A title deed gives one ownership and economic empowerment .

Our intention should be to make sure that all South Africans , no matter the background , can own land in their own right . It is not about one race taking land from another , but about mainly poor , mainly black South Africans owning the homes they live in . <p> The ANC 's colossal failure to undo the legacy of the 1913 Land Act is not the fault of the Constitution . It is fault of the corruption , looting , and chronic underfunding in land reform programmes over the past 24 years .

" <p> Below is the full statement : <p> DECEITFUL BAWUMIA MUST STOP MISLEADING CLAIMS ABOUT CEDI DEPRECIATION <p> I have read a statement posted by Vice President Bawumia in which he sought to defend his poor handling of the exchange rate of the cedi leading to a free fall of the local currency . <p> Vice-President Bawumia has gained notoriety over the years for abusing public trust in his supposed credentials to peddle outrageous untruths about the Ghanaian economy . While he may have gotten away with it in opposition , the bar is significantly higher in government and he will be held to strict proof based on documented facts . <p> Rather than focusing on " arresting the cedi " and attending to the legitimate concerns of businesses , Dr. Bawumia has again swung into propaganda mode in reaction to a simple tweet by Former President Mahama that only sought to remind him gently about his own past views on the depreciation of the cedi . <p> In a release on Sunday , June 17 , 2018 , Dr. Bawumia , in typical haughty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminder as a lack of understanding of key aspects of the economy . The tweet was simply about whether he has been able to " arrest the cedi " as he declared , and whether the macroeconomic fundamentals were indeed supportive of a stable currency . <p> Instead of a straightforward answer to this question , he purported to delve into a historical account of the depreciation of the cedi as if that was the answer to the suffering of businesses and Ghanaians as a whole , in the wake of the current nose-dive of the local currency . In case he was unaware , the rapid fall of the cedi has led to upward adjustments in fuel prices and is leading to general increases in the price of goods and services . The obviously distorted historical account does not answer these pressing issues for Ghanaians . <p> Regarding that historical account , it will be obvious to all who know about the exchange rate that Dr Bawumia 's calculation of the cedi 's depreciation over the 8 years of successive governments is fatally inaccurate . While it is known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Vice President , he could have consulted the Bank of Ghana who would confirm that the rate of change formula is not what is used to calculate exchange rate depreciation . <p> To determine the accurate rate of depreciation or appreciation , the current rate is subtracted from the previous rate and the answer divided by the current rate which is the multiplied by 100 ( Previous Rate-Current Rate ) /Current Rate x 100 . <p> If Dr Bawumia was minded to do an accurate and honest calculation , the respective percentage of depreciation would have been 41.6 percent under President Kufour ; 71.4% under Mills/Mahama ; and 6.6% for the 15 months of the Akufo Addo/Bawumia government .

First of all , basic economics explains the role of policy lags in economic policy making . This simply means that policies implemented in a particular year would have its full effect in the subsequent year(s) . In the case of SANKOFA and TEN , he was vociferous in publishing policies that are helping the government today . <p> In other words , it is wrong to expect a strict contemporaneous relationship between policy actions and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the so-called lower depreciation in the first years of NPP governments ( as Dr. Bawumia is claiming ) , is actually due to the good policy measures that were adopted in the preceding year by the former NDC government . Similarly , the fact that the first year of successive NDC governments witnessed pronounced depreciation was simply because of the reckless policies by the preceding NPP government . <p> As noted , an example is the Single Spine Salary Structure that was introduced by the NPP government under Former President Kufuor for implementation in 2009 . A contrasting example was the performance of the Cedi in 2017 , which was largely due to policy measures under the IMF Enhanced Credit Facility that started under the NDC government in 2015 . Indeed , there was stability in the forex market for the most part of 2016 , and which continued in 2017 after the election related uncertainties waned . <p> We wish to remind the self-styled astute economist that , unlike some major SSA countries , Ghana was able to avoid a recession , giving the current administration a head-start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is rather Dr. Bawumia who has shown a lack of understanding about the factors that cause volatility in the forex markets . Otherwise , he would not have made the statement that he had arrested the cedi in the inchoate stages of this government . <p> It is universally known that forex market stability in Ghana to a large extent depends on exogenous factors ( and of course other endogenous factors ) such as commodity price shocks , uncertainty in the financial markets , global financing conditions , energy shocks and its impact on crude oil imports , as well as other fiscal pressures . <p> Thus , in years such as 2008 , 2013 , and 2014 when such exogenous factors were pronounced , the forex market became volatile and unstable . The solution therefore is to work on our resilience to such shocks and to build the necessary buffers to absorb such shocks ( as we did with substantive measures that he opposed ) , not through borrowing or through issuance of sovereign bonds that are channeled into consumption , not investments ! <p> Allowing the exchange rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stem the impact of some of these exogenous shocks , especially where the shocks are persistent . <p> For the sake of clarity , it would be recalled that during the period before the 2008 elections , there was a sudden global surge in commodity prices as well as fiscal pressures associated with the run up to the 2008 elections that impacted adversely on the macroeconomic situation . The meltdown gave rise to the onset of the global financial crises that we alluded to earlier . <p> Upon assumption of office by the NDC in 2009 , the government had to sign on to the IMF Extended Credit Facility ( ECF ) to restore macroeconomic stability from 2009-2011 . The programme achieved its aims as inflation for example was reduced from 20% in 2009 to 8% in 2011 , the forex market was stable and interest rates declined to near single digits . <p> Unfortunately , the impact of the significant wage adjustments as well as other exogenous factors impacted the economy adversely from 2012 . On the global front , uncertainties in the financial markets and weak commodity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political uncertainty arising from the election petition , pressures in the fiscal and external sectors , and the severe energy crisis that confronted the country . Pressures continued to mount due to pass-through effects of petroleum and utility tariff adjustments as well as fiscal and exchange rate pressures . <p> In 2014 , unfavourable global developments such as softening commodity prices , and volatility in financial markets and reduced FDI flows continued to impact adversely . The decline in commodity prices continued to support the rapid depreciation of the domestic currency . On the domestic front , the main challenges were the continued energy supply constraints , pressures in the foreign exchange market and fiscal imbalances . <p> In 2015 , Ghana eventually signed a three-year Enhanced Credit Facility programme with the IMF to restore macroeconomic stability . The key tenets of the programme included fiscal consolidation , enhanced monetary policy implementation and structural reforms , especially in the public sector . The policy measures contributed significantly to reducing excessive exchange rate volatility and a trend decline in inflation from the second half of the year . <p> In 2016 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global and domestic conditions that posed challenges for the macro environment . These included lower commodity prices for all three exports ( gold , crude oil and cocoa ) and tighter external financing conditions . There were also domestic factors such as petroleum production bottlenecks , weak private sector credit growth as well as negative business and consumer sentiments relating to the general elections in December which also affected general economic outcomes . These notwithstanding , there was stability in the foreign exchange market for most part of 2016 . <p> The Vice-President cuts the figure of a man who talks more than he delivers and who when found out chooses bluster over sobriety and reflection . His claims to better fundamentals expose his lack of candour . <p> The growth rates he likes to tout is well known to be due to an 80.4% increase in oil production in 2017 as compared to 2016 . His other claim of a lower debt to GDP ratio is yet more manifestation of a deceptive mindset that seeks to conceal the true state of governments borrowing . <p> Just as the exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a doer , the astronomical borrowing of this government has belied his claims about borrowing while in opposition . He is on record to have disparaged borrowing by the previous government and claimed that a government that he is part of will harness domestic resources to develop the country . <p> In government , Dr Bawumia and his boss , President Akufo Addo have developed a voracious appetite for borrowing and have added a staggering GHS 40 billion to the public debt . Dr Bawumia however shamelessly is superintending the deliberate concealment of this fact by constantly understating the debt by several months ' borrowing and deceptively manipulating the country 's GDP to give the semblance of a lower debt to GDP ratio . <p> To achieve this , he connives with the Bank of Ghana to hold the public debt constant at February rates while dividing it over a so-called projected GDP which is yet to be realised . After this , he compares the fictitious debt to GDP ratio to the actual outturn for 2016 . <p> It may interest Dr Bawumia that the IMF under whose auspices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fooled by this gambit . They peg our debt to GDP ratio at 71% <p> Finally , it may serve as a useful exercise for Dr Bawumia to check the macro-economic indices between 2010 and 2012 when Former President Mahama was Vice-President and Head of the Economic Management Team . Ghana had the highest ever growth rate , the longest sustained period of single digit inflation ( 31 months ) among other stable indicators . It is a record he has not and will , in all likelihood , be unable to match . Those indices completely dwarfs the meagre offerings he seeks to tout today . <p> It therefore would help him greatly if he cut back on the haughtiness and focused on reining in the cedi which is in free fall at the moment and stem the anxiety and anguish of businesses and Ghanaians who are reeling under severe hardships at the moment . <p> Do you ever witness news or have a story that should be featured on Pulse Ghana ?

@@25264236 <h> Arzani impresses but Socceroos slack in attack <p> An exceptionally hard-working performance from Australia helped break down a stingy Denmark defence , but a slow start meant that the game finished 1-1 , leaving the Socceroos in danger of missing out on the round of 16 . Bert van Marwijk 's men really needed to capitalise on a strong second half by scoring a winner , but were ultimately let down by their average finishing . <p> Positives <p> The Socceroos became the first team to score against Denmark in six matches , albeit from a controversial penalty decision courtesy of VAR . There was also plenty to like about Australia 's second half performance , as they finally attacked with more vigour and purpose , especially after livewire Daniel Arzani came on . <p> Negatives <p> As they were against France , Australia 's central defenders and midfielders were quite timid on the ball , not looking for positive passes often enough early in the game .

His distribution was spot on once again , helping to control the tempo and direction of the attack . <p> DF Aziz Behich , 7 -- Very solid performance from Australia 's left-back , who perhaps did n't venture forward as often as he did against Les Bleus , but certainly proved he is the best option at left-back by far . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout the game , providing a solid foundation for the Socceroos .

Had a couple of opportunities to contribute more in attack , but hit a couple of wayward crosses . <p> MF Aaron Mooy , 8 -- Started the game slightly sluggish , and could have cleared more convincingly prior to Denmark 's goal . In the second half , however , Mooy came to life and started to control the game in midfield . <p> MF Mile Jedinak , 7 -- The skipper again converted from the penalty spot to level the scores in the first half .

@@25564239 <p> Gab Marcotti and the ESPN FC crew discuss how far along Liverpool are in their contract negotiations with Roma 's Alisson . <p> A month after ? it was claimed Loris Karius suffered concussion ? during the Champions League final , he and Liverpool have regrouped for preseason training . <p> Obviously the first big question Jurgen Klopp would be asked was about his goalkeeper -- and he was quite assertive . He attributed full blame for the two major errors which cost Liverpool a sixth European Cup to the goalkeeper 's injury . <p> " We do n't think about that anymore and we start completely anew " -- which is all well and good , unless you were one of many supporters calling for a new , better goalkeeper . <p> Critics of Karius walked upon eggshells for weeks . Concussion in any sport needs serious investigation , especially in football . Though it lacks the physical impact of American Football it also lacks the protective headgear . The reluctance to stop any game , even for something so important , is also a factor in why swifter diagnosis and treatment must be addressed . Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example . Any small wait is anathema to a football fan . <p> None of which alters the fact numerous Liverpool supporters would have wanted a better goalkeeper even before those mistakes against Real Madrid . Rumours about the club 's pursuit of Roma 's Allison or Atletico Madrid 's Jan Oblak were in the media long before Kiev . Defeat against Real Madrid merely clinched it for many . <p> There has been cynicism ever since the concussion announcement . Some predicted Liverpool would fudge on a new goalkeeper because they regarded the fees speculated upon as way too high . <p> That 's probably unfair and can be dismissed with one name ; Virgil van Dijk . Klopp broke the world record for a defender in order to land the ? ? 75 million Dutchman and fix an obvious flaw in his team . Why not a goalkeeper too ? <p> There are other reasons for any reluctance to act . Klopp may , somehow , feel that Karius is the answer and will come good eventually . He may lack the ruthlessness needed to get rid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ago for example , but not Klopp . It was only an injury to the Spaniard that gave Andy Robertson the proper chance to shine at left back . <p> There 's a flaw in the logic that Karius would only have made those errors because of concussion . There were smaller but significant errors peppered throughout the season . <p> Nothing on a Kiev level certainly , but some a top-quality keeper probably would n't make . Letting a Leroy Sane shot past him at the near post in January during the 4-3 defeat of Manchester City , for example . <p> A punch straight out to Tottenham 's Victor Wanyama -- when he possibly should have caught it -- was thumped straight past him into the net . Wanyama 's stunning finish helped camouflage that mistake . Or the Aleksandar Kolorov shot for Roma that slipped through his grasp and hit the crossbar in the Champions League semifinal . <p> There are other examples , combined with a lack of aerial dominance , and Liverpool could easily improve in his position without spending eye-watering amounts of cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make those final agonising steps toward clinching trophies . <p> Of course Klopp 's public pronouncement does n't necessarily mean he 's sticking with Karius . It may be an elaborate ruse to force Roma or Atletico Madrid towards more realism on price , if they intend to sell at all . <p> Is it Klopp 's way of saying that if a realistic improvement on Karius was only small , why bother at all ? It 's bold , at least . Patience and stubbornness paid off with Van Dijk for example , where no " reluctant alternative " was even considered . <p> The goalkeeper 's flamboyant Instagram video did n't help and was soon lampooned . For many , it 's no laughing matter . Karius is entitled to enjoy his holiday , but the last time supporters heard from him was apologising for Kiev . A lower profile might have served him better . <p> When Uruguay 's Fernando Muslera let a shot through his fingers against France in the World Cup , TV immediately referenced Liverpool 's goalkeeper . It was a Karius Moment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's only 25 after all , a baby in goalkeeper years . <p> He 's going to be under incredible pressure , knowing his next mistake will create massive headlines and give his faithful manager a giant headache . <p> He may be tough enough to get through it . Producing that holiday video revealed he must have the skin of a rhinoceros if he thought that was even vaguely appropriate . Good enough to get through it , though ? That 's another matter . <p> This is the transfer window and you ca n't trust anything anyone says . Remember when Liverpool said they had no interest in Mario Balotelli -- and who walked through the door two weeks later ? <p> Klopp is more of a straight-talker , though . If he actually thinks Karius can remain Liverpool 's No.1 he will be held far more accountable than the goalkeeper himself when it almost inevitably goes wrong . <p> Steven Kelly is one of ESPN FC 's Liverpool bloggers .

@@25701231 <h> Causes of inflation in Ghana <p> Inflation is the rate at which prices of commodities keep rising . When the amount is hiked , each unit of the available currency buys fewer items . In turn , the purchasing power of money drops . Like many other countries around the world , causes of inflation in Ghana are linked to an increase in the price of commodities , with no increase in the consumer 's income . <p> SOURCE : seekingalpha.com <p> Many people do not have an idea the causes of inflation or even what inflation is . They just wonder why sometimes good and services are expensive.In this article we will tackle the causes of inflation and also define inflation . Read on . <h> Which is the best definition of inflation ? <p> This question can be best answered by first looking at inflation definition economics from an economist 's perspective . In economic terms , inflation arises from two main concepts , namely supply and demand . These are competing factors which if not controlled in a sustainable manner , have a grave impact on the economy . For instance , when the demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services tend to go high . <p> On the other hand , high supply and low demand lead to a reduction in costs of products or services . These dependent factors are usually controlled to avoid inflation . The nature of inflation varies from one economy to the other ; hence distinguishing the types of inflation is essential . The following types of inflation that may be experienced . <p> Currency inflation due to excessive printing of money <p> Credit inflation due to financial institutions sanctioning more loans and advances to consumers than what the economy requires . As a result of this credit expansion , the increase in the costs of products and services is experienced . <p> Deficit induced inflation which occurs when the government asks its central bank for more money to meet the shortage it has in its budget . Budget shortage arises when the expenses are more than the revenue generated . <p> Demand-pull inflation which arises when the aggregate demand for products or services are higher than their supply <p> Cost-push inflation brought about by an increase in production cost <p> Therefore , inflation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general level of costs of commodities or services is increasing , and , accordingly the purchasing power of the currency is declining . <h> Why does inflation occur ? <p> Inflation is a key component of the economy which mainly occurs when there is an overall increase in demand for goods or services in the country than the supply could meet . If not properly controlled , a country 's currency significantly loses its purchasing power to the extent that its economy crumbles . <h> What are the causes of Inflation in Ghana ? <p> SOURCE : commons.wikimedia.org <p> There are numerous causes of inflation and they are influenced by other factors which if managed , can help in lowering the level of inflation to sustainable levels . This is usually done by the government in collaboration with other key players in the economy . The main causes of inflation in Ghana and the factors that influence them are discussed as follows : <h> Demand-pull inflation <p> This means that the aggregate demand for products or services grows faster than the aggregate supply resulting in an increase in prices . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its supply , prices tend to go high and this leads to inflation . The following factors cause demand-pull inflation : <p> Reduction in the interest rates charged by financial institutions may result in many people taking loans . A consequence of this is the availability of excess money circulating in the economy leading to increasing prices of commodities . Goods and services sought become limited compared to the available money . <p> Higher demand from an economic stimulus , for example , elevated government expenditure and lower direct taxes . A decrease in direct tax means that people have more money to spend . Furthermore , increased government spending and borrowing create additional demand in the circular flow . <h> Monetary inflation <p> Flooding or excessive supply of money into the economy also results in inflation . In any economy , supply and demand of either goods or services determine their prices . Consequently , the overdue supply of product results in its price reduction . Similarly , if the product that is in excessive supply is money , its value diminishes . <p> When money has low purchasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resulting in inflation . Monetary factors affecting inflation can also occur through actions such as printing of more money by the central bank . <h> Cost-push inflation <p> Inflation can also be brought about by increased production cost of companies . In the event of this situation , the companies transfer this cost to their consumers by increases prices so that they are able to retain their profits . Other factors that contribute to cost-push inflation include rising wages and increasing material prices , in particular , oil . <p> The former is a major component of cost-push inflation . This occurs especially when trade unions demand an increase in wages of their members thus leading to an increase in demand for products and services as people have more money . <p> Increase in global oil prices has a significant effect on the cost of most products in the economy resulting in inflation . High oil prices lead to high production cost and consequently rise in product prices . <p> In addition , declining productivity by firms also results in cost-push inflation . This is because it results in increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the revenue collected by the government will be low , thus the government may not be able to meet its expenses . <p> More so , an increase in taxes such as VAT and excise duty by the government also causes inflation as the effect is passed to the consumers . Firms would want to maintain their profit levels or they risk going out of business if they are to incur the costs . <p> A decline in the exchange rate is another example of a cost-push factor that results in inflation . The cost of imports increases hence , companies importing raw materials will have to pay more thus their production costs also hikes . Users of their products bare this charge as a result of cost transfer . <p> Monopoly employers especially corporations which huge market share in the economy tends to hike the prices of their goods or services resulting in inflation . This misuse of market power negatively impacts the economy . <p> Besides the three main factors that cause inflation in Ghana , other examples of inflation factors that cause hiking of prices include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practices and insufficient production factors . When the output of a country is constant and there is increased demand from factors such as population growth and export demand , the costs of products goes high . <p> Constant output can be due to lack of capital equipment and poor management of the people leading to low productivity and wastage of available resources . The limited resources available are therefore strained and cause inflation . <p> Restrictive trade practices such as over taxation and poor laws discourage investors and this result in inflation as the production cost is high . Additionally , a constricting business environment due to poor laws may lead to investors transferring their business to other countries where the laws are more accommodating or increasing product prices to stay in business . <h> Impact of inflation on business in Ghana <p> SOURCE : ghanaweb.com <p> The high level of inflation in Ghana of which currently is about 9.8 percent has negatively affected business in the country . A real life example of inflation effect in businesses is ; if there is an increase in production factors such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monetary exchange rate , interest rate , cost of natural and human resources . Companies react by transferring the cost to the consumers . <p> This is because , on their end , they experience high production cost and since they want to maintain profit levels and stay in business , customers have to bear increased costs of products . This situation was experienced during the presidency of John Dramani Mahama in 2013-2016 . During his reign , the cost of doing business in Ghana was very high . The productions factors were not favorable to firms . The unfavorable conditions resulted in some companies closing down their business as they could not sustain themselves . <p> Another effect of high inflation rate in business is a retrenchment of workers . Companies do this in order to cut their costs . This is due to reduced profits resulting from increased production costs . Therefore , to cut on some of their expenses , they reduce their wage bill . <p> High inflation rate also has an effect on investor and consumer confidence . For example , when investors find that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to other countries , they can transfers some of their business operations there or in the worst case scenario , completely shut down operations and move where conditions are favorable . <p> More so , low investor confidence due to inflation also discourages them from taking loans from banks . Causes of inflation in Ghana pdf explain that this negatively affects banks profits and can result in them closing some of their branches or going out of business completely . <p> Low consumer confidence as a result of inflation , leads to less spending . People are afraid of spending their money on products and services leading to enormous losses for businesses . Consequently , enterprises may thus be unable to pay back their loans hence creating non-performing loans in banks . This causes huge losses to the affected banks and may lead to the winding up their operations . This is what transpired in UT and Capital Banks in Ghana in 2017 . <p> In addition , inflation also results in the Central Bank escalating its Minimum Capital Requirements of banks . This is because of the trickling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing business means investors require high capital to start or sustain a business . This may lead to nonperforming loans hence banks will not be able to finance such enterprises or investors with the right amount of money , as they afraid they may not be able to pay back on time thus significantly affecting their operations . <p> Moreover , banks which are not able to meet the minimum capital requirement set by the Central Bank will have to go out of business or forced to merge with other banks in order to remain functional . This has a negative effect on the banks as they may end up losing their brand . <h> Why does inflation happen ? <p> SOURCE : iexparts.com <p> In summary , the main causes of inflation in Ghana stemming from the demand-pull and cost-push factors are a higher demand for goods and services than the supply , reduced interest rates charged by financial institutions , high production costs , reduced productivity , increased taxes , and decline in exchange rate making costs of imports to go high . <p> This has resulted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making the ordinary Ghanaian live in hardship . The wages they receive is insufficient to meet their basic daily needs . Others have had to resort to illegal activities such as theft in order to sustain themselves . Therefore , it is important that the government protects its citizen from adverse effects of inflation by lowering the production cost through regulation of interest rates and taxes . <h> Conclusion <p> To conclude , inflation basically refers to a sustained increase in the prices of goods and services and this situation is normally non-seasonal in nature . In Ghana , demand-pull and cost-push factors have significantly contributed to the high rate of inflation being witnessed in the country .

We consider Kumasi and opera square filmmakers illiterate but they are way more united and that is why they can organize a seminar and give you a colonial identity , that is why they can share ASOG residuals and leave others out . It 's Book-long aka pride and greed . Bickering , gossip and rip each other apart . Instead of being partners in progress , we are rivals in competition . I am personally so cautious of Ghanaian filmmakers based on numerous bad experiences ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no trust . How is this fixed ? <p> To Madam Catherine Afeku . To adequately support/build the film industry , you need all voices at the table -- Leaders of the industry should be not appointed by political appreciation . A thorough representation of all branches and genres of films and filmmakers is needed . Hear from all of us and shape the industry in such a way that will benefit the country . Surrounding yourself with a few greedy people who have only gained and not contributed anything to sustainability of the industry is sad . They know next to nothing about how a film industry should be ran or organized . Look at their tax returns , their books and contributions before you seek advice from them . Look at the type of films they have put out . If that is what you want to identify the Ghanaian life with ... by their fruits .

In truth , his command of the language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2016 , but his confidence in it is clearly lacking . <p> Appearance <p> Looking sharp in a tailored suit , the clean-shaven and bespectacled Sarri lived up to the fashionable standard of Italian managers in the Premier League that Carlo Ancelotti and Conte maintained at their Stamford Bridge unveilings . <p> What he said <p> Consciously or not , Sarri established himself as the ideological opposite to Conte throughout , returning to his central belief that football should be " fun " every bit as often as his predecessor had referenced " work " in his first Stamford Bridge media address . <p> " My goal is to have fun as long as I am here and be competitive in all competitions until the end , " he said . <p> " Ours is not a sport , but a game , and anybody who plays a game starts doing that when they 're young , it is fun . The child in each of us must be nurtured because this often makes us the best . <p> " I think if a team has fun often , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then there are the high-level objectives , but we must start by having fun . This is important for us and our fans . " <p> Asked if " fun " wins trophies , he replied with a smile : " Sometimes yes , sometimes not . But I think it is better to enjoy . " <p> Sarri did , however , bristle slightly when he was reminded that he is yet to win major silverware in his 13-year coaching career , responding with a compelling defence of his record at Napoli . <p> " It is true I have n't won anything , but I have been in Serie A five years , and think apart from Juventus nobody has won anything , " he pointed out . " For three years in a row at Napoli we had record points . In the first year 81 points , 82 was another record and 91 was as well . <p> " I think that we worked very well and the difference in working well and winning is often minimal . I hope I will be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between doing well and winning . " <p> Perhaps most importantly in light of the internal conflicts that made Conte 's position untenable , Sarri reiterated his long-held conviction that he is a coach , not a manager when it comes to transfers . <p> " I think I am one of the few managers who is bored by the transfer market , " he explained . " I do n't want to talk about it , I am not that interested in it . I think our task as managers is about growing the players we have . " <p> Sarri also expressed regret about the homophobic and sexist comments he made while Napoli coach , well aware that a repeat will not be tolerated at Chelsea . <p> " These were mistakes , that is for sure , " he admitted . " I think that those who know me very well can not define me in this way , not homophobic or sexist or racist , absolutely not . I am an extremely open person and I do not have these kinds of problems and I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> How he handled the media <p> Sarri 's answers , relayed via a translator , were thoughtful and comprehensive on all subjects . He did not attempt to evade anything , even when asked to revisit the insensitive comments that marred his time in Italy , and calmly laid out his football philosophy in front of Chelsea director Marina Granovskaia and chairman Bruce Buck , who were both seated in the front row . <p> Best quote <p> " Our 's is not a sport , but a game and anybody who plays a game starts doing that when they 're young , it is fun . The child in each of us must be nurtured because this often makes us the best " -- Sarri 's response when asked what he hopes to bring to Chelsea . <p> Differences from Conte <p> Where to start ? Judging by his words here , Sarri wants his Chelsea players to enjoy every minute of life under him , while Conte set the tone for a brutal preseason grind and the relentless intensity that laid the foundation for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , physically and emotionally . <p> Sarri was keen to emphasise the relative triviality of football as a game to be enjoyed , rather than the " little war machine " that Conte sought to recreate at Chelsea after leaving the Italy national side . <p> And it 's fair to assume that Granovskaia and Buck , who grew deeply exasperated with Conte 's uncompromising approach to transfer discussions , will have been particularly pleased to hear Sarri publicly repeat his disdain for recruitment . <p> Room for improvement <p> Sarri knows he ca n't continue to conduct news conferences in Italian ; Chelsea were forced to clarify a couple of significant mistranslations that left his comments open to misinterpretation . He is already having regular English lessons and hopes to be confident enough in his skills to change his approach during preseason . <p> Verdict <p> 8 out of 10 : Sarri was as advertised , a football philosopher pledging to bring his unique brand of fun to Stamford Bridge . Time is short to implement his ideas in a summer schedule that yields precious little training time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chelsea 's players to buy in , supporters will be in for a thrilling ride .

Stephen Odoi-Larbi <p> Date : 25-09-2018 Time : 05:09:13:am <p> The past few days have been so interesting on our airwaves , print , television and new media regarding the payment of US$3million to Mr. Kevin Okyere 's Springfield Energy by the Bulk Oil Storage and Transport ( BOST ) Company Limited , a major state-owned player in the oil business . <p> I have keenly been monitoring the spirited fight mounted by the Member of Parliament ( MP ) for Bongo , Edward Bawa , with the perceived aim of protecting the purse while in the process , maligning and defaming some individuals who have spent so many years building their reputation and businesses that are employing hundreds of Ghanaians . <p> I get worried whenever I see an MP whose livelihood largely depends on the sweat of the tax payer 's money go on that tangent knowing very well that the collapse of indigenous businesses in the country will impact negatively on his or her stay in the august @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It is in fact , the businesses in the private sector that have contributed to sustaining the economy in which we find ourselves . <p> Their role is indisputable . That is why successive governments have over the years spent millions of cedis to create an enabling environment for private businesses to operate in . <p> It is also based on the success stories of the private sector that successive governments diversified the operations of some state-owned companies and handed them over to private individuals to manage or entered into a Public-Private Partnership with private institutions that have the expertise to run such businesses . <p> Therefore , by virtue of the sensitive public position an MP occupies , his or her utterances could make or unmake a business which took so many years in building that brand . <p> I have taken this particular position because it is the private sector that puts food on my table . <p> Bread and butter issues have become a concern to many in this country looking at the numerous redeployment exercises being carried by some businesses in the private sector . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unemployment rate which has been exacerbated by the laying off of thousands of workers , all from the private sector , is a threat to national security . <p> If people do n't have jobs , armed robbery and other social vices will become the order of the day . <p> To delve into the BOST-Springfield Energy issue , the attacks on the person of Kevin Okyere and his Springfield Energy by Edward Bawa are unwarranted . <p> Mr. Bawa 's desire to link some notable personalities to the BOST saga is also unwarranted . It creates the impression that all those people have conspired to rob the state of its resources . <p> Available records indicate that Springfield Energy imported some oil into the country as far back as 2013 and was stored in the tanks of BOST . Springfield Energy was paying for the space provided by BOST . <p> Later , it was reported that the volumes of oil were nowhere to be found . To sum it up , the oil was missing from the tanks of BOST . <p> Nothing was done to recover the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's narration , happened when Mr. John Kojo Afful , now the Head of Finance , was the Acting Managing Director of BOST . <p> Springfield Energy typical of any business , then sued BOST on November 18 , 2015 , demanding the full recovery of the cost of the product as well as interest , all summing up to about US$20,226,717.75 . <p> To break it down , the cost of the product itself was about US$11million and the compound interest US$9million . Springfield Energy also made a claim of loss of profit of $3,420,000.00 . <p> A summary judgment was , however , awarded to Springfield Energy by an Accra High Court . <p> Per Bawa 's narration , BOST was not happy with the ruling . Operating under a new manager in the person of Dr. Kwame Awuah Darko , BOST then filed a stay of execution at the court to enable them to appeal against the judgment . He then sought the services of external lawyers to fight the case . <p> The High Court , according to Bawa , partially granted BOST its request and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as ascertained by the auditors and agreed by both parties . This was $11,104,143.29 . <p> The remaining 19% interest rate of US$9million was still in contention . <p> According to Bawa , on December 20 , 2016 , BOST , under Awuah Darko , paid the said principal amount of $11,104,143.29 through a Five-Year Term loan from Fidelity Bank . <p> Spring Energy , I am told in September 2017 , approached Mr. Alfred Obeng , who was then the MD of BOST to have the matter settle out of court . <p> Following negotiations on the settlement agreement on the US$9million , Mr. Alfred Obeng then ordered for the payment of US$4million without the consent of the external lawyers . <p> The settlement agreement was then forwarded to the external lawyers for their perusal . According to Bawa , the external lawyers clearly advised against further payment to Springfield because Springfield , in their opinion , was not entitled to an amount of $9 million as an interest payment . <p> Here , the external lawyers failed to address or state in clear terms what in their view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount . <p> Bawa in his write up on the subject matter created the impression that Springfield Energy has been engaging in dubious and fictitious deals by reechoing the words of the external lawyers in their response to BOST . <p> Where did Springfield Energy go wrong to deserve this unfair treatment from Bawa ? In the minds of the public , the Bongo MP has created the impression that Springfield Energy has not been involved in a genuine business . <p> On Wednesday , September 19 , 2018 , the immediate past MD of BOST , Mr. Alfred Obeng , in an interview with Accra-based Class FM stated that he directed the payment of US$4million out of the US$9million interest to Springfield Energy based on legal advice he received from the Head of Legal Affairs at BOST . <p> Again , where did Springfield Energy go wrong to deserve such an unfair comment from Bawa ? <p> Has the Bongo MP sought clarification from the new MD of BOST , George Mensah Okley and John Kojo Ankoful why an additional US$3million was paid to Springfield Energy before going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Parliament , there are so many ways he could have explored to demand answers from the management of BOST . <p> As a member of the Mines and Energy Committee , Bawa could have lobbied his Chairman to sermon officials of BOST to appear before the Committee to respond to the payments made to Springfield Energy against the advice of their external lawyers . <p> He could also file a question on the subject matter for sector Minister in this case the Minister of Energy to respond to the concerns raised . <p> To go public and try to create the impression that Springfield Energy is involved in dubious deals is unwarranted of an MP . <p> I will urge Springfield Energy to go for the audio recordings of all the interviews Bawa has granted to some radio and television stations on the matter , review his comments , and sue him if any act of defamation of character is detected . <p> Bawa should know that as an MP who lives on public funds , much as it requires of him to protect the public purse , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his upkeep through the taxes they pay to the government . <p> What is good for the goose is equally good for the gander .

Ever since I have had this sweet encounter with the Black Stars that I consistently follow each step they take both within the continent and on the international stage . <p> While I accept and admonish others to do same that although the national team does not belong to any one particular player , manager or fun , there is , however , one superb gem the country seems to have chastised the most yet his absence in most of our encounters finds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes hard to accept and so when it becomes so apparent and/or felt with much surety , it must be admitted .

In fact , I do n't even know him or have any personal relationship with him . But wait , must I be economical with the truth ? Absolutely NOT ! because if my voice can not be heard proclaiming the truth , then I think the power of a pen and paper can serve the populace right . <p> Asamoah Gyan got his debut for the national team in 2003 as a substitute to Isaac Boakye during a World Cup qualifying encounter against Somalia .

Even though these negatives shrouded his football career , Asamoah Gyan seemed relentless anytime he was called upon . This was demonstrated by his spectacular deliveries especially on tough occasions during tournaments . I have with me some important moments of the finest striker : <p> In 2006 when Ghana lost to Italy in the first group stage encounter , all hopes were lost as many thought there was no way Ghana could make it into the next game against a much stronger Czech Republic side who was before the finals ranked third in the World ranking according to FIFA . On 17th June 2006 , one tensed afternoon for Ghana , Asamoah Gyan gave us a very important early goal that relieved and calmed the nation and eventually contributed to our win in that particular encounter .

The year 2010 was a moment every Ghanaian will never forget . <p> This is because , in that year , Gyan led the ' twinkle twinkle ' little Stars to the Finals of the AFCON through his important goals against the host nation , Angola and a much stronger Nigerian side in the quarter-finals and semi-finals respectively . It did not end there . In June that same year , Asamoah Gyan took Ghana on his shoulders at the World Cup , a moment I do n't need to remind anyone .

In 2014 , when Ghana participated in the World Cup , an Asamoah-Gyan-assist got us the equalizer against the USA . I hope we have all not forgotten the joy he gave us in the goal he scored against Germany ; one of the most difficult and beautiful games the World Cup witnessed according to pundits .

Gyan 's only goal in 2017 AFCON against Mali got us straight qualification going into our last game . Do n't these records serve us right ? This man has on most occasions saved his country . His absence in some few games these days has seen us fumbling . Can we ever blaze without Gyan ? The recent game against Kenya got me wondering whether the journey ahead could ever be rosy when we play for 90 minutes and squander all our chances . <p> In my esteemed view , I think these moments have presented itself to us in a bid to believe that this hero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the African top scorer in the World Cup . This is a player who left Europe to the United Arab Emirate and still delivered , a patriotic man who single-handedly paid the bonuses of the Black Queens after winning the All African Games in 2015 . A statesman who paid for the Chattered flight of the Black Stars from Brazzaville to Accra in 2017 . This is above all , our all-time top scorer with 51 goals . Come on the time is now . Well done Gyan . If they wo n't celebrate you , the young ones have started and I lead that movement . I nearly forgot your Astroturf for Accra Academy .

@@30115234 <p> Lionel Messi continues to prove that his status in the football history is special . While others like Hazard , De Bruyne or Salah trying to be leaders in their team with varied success , Messi confirms his greatness during several years . <p> It definitely makes him the GOAT - Greatest Of All Time , and here are three main factors picked by YEN.com.gh which helped Messi become such a unique player . <p> 1 . Messi has love for Catalonia <p> For most players , being a part of their club is honor too , but first of all it is a job not always enjoyable , but for Messi it is more than just work . Playing football for him is a duty and grand responsibility because of his connection with Catalonia . <p> We all know that story about Barca paid for his treatment while Messi was a child , and looks like he appreciates that till now . Despite being talented , he was not offered help by the local clubs , who were not willing to pay for his medicals in Argentina , so he moved to Spain at the age of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lights a spark in his heart in every single game . <p> 2 . He is surrounded by great players <p> No matter what talent you have , you can not achieve success if your teammates ca n't encourage the aspirations and wo n't fight with you on the pitch . Throughout his career Messi always had greatest players behind : Eto'o , Ronaldinho , Xavi , Iniesta , Suarez , Coutinho . And we can talk not only about attacking trio , but even more about midfielders and defenders . No team except Real Madrid can count on the squad like that in the last ten years . <p> Certainly he would not be lost in any other strong European club , but here in Barcelona he plays on the highest level and fights for the most important awards including because of the stuff . Although the value of the manager in clubs like that can be exaggerated , environment in sports really means a lot . It 's easier to become a football legend when you already have several around . <p> 3 . Messi has an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a controversial statement . From birth , he has something that others will never have . Even looking at Ronaldo you can admit it , just to compete on equal level with Messi you 'll need incredible ability to work ( that no one except CR7 really has ) . <p> Talent is very important in the rare moments when you and your rival are at the limit , and one episode in a few seconds can show who is the winner . Super efforts can make super results , but only if the opponents throw up one 's cards earlier . That is why some players may have big wins , and just a few of them can be a recorded in history as the best athletes of the decade .

@@30152238 <p> The subject of decolonization of higher education has been at the centre of numerous discourses , student and academic protests and intense dialogue and debate in post - apartheid South Africa . <p> South Africa , like the Global South , possesses higher education institutions with direct and deep roots in colonialism and racism that are challenging existing structures and invoking indigenization , diversification , depatriachalization , decolonization and democratization . <p> Comparative insights and experiences of change in the higher education sector across the Global South are important at this time . <p> Therefore this conference is important for the higher education sector as a whole <p> Decolonisation is commonly understood as the undoing of colonialism . <p> It entails the process whereby colonised people rediscover and recover their own history , culture , language and identity . <p> It is when colonised people invoke their histories , worldviews , and indigenous knowledge systems to theorise and imagine alternative possibilities , including a different curriculum . <p> Decolonisation is a necessary response to first and second generation colonialism , neo-colonialism and neoliberalism . <p> First generation colonialism was the conquering of the physical spaces and bodies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the colonisation of the mind through disciplines , such as education , science , economics and law . <p> Neo-colonialism relates to the achievement of technical independence by a country , but that is still under the influence of ex-colonial country . <p> The first President of independent Ghana , Kwame Nkrumah , argued that neo-colonialism is a more insidious form of colonialism because it is more difficult to detect . <p> It also involves new-elites who were trained by colonialists and that take on the roles of colonialists in countries , post-independence . <p> In the context of South African higher education , decolonisation is the comprehensive transformation or change of the curriculum and institutional cultures to primarily reflect and promote African context . <p> It signifies the process of effecting meaningful change in the academic , social , economic , demographic , political and cultural domains of institutional life . It relates to discarding what has been wrongly written , and interrogating distortions of people 's life experiences , negative labelling , deficit theorizing , genetically deficient or culturally deficient models that pathologized the colonised . <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future . <p> It is about self-determination and social justice for those who have been marginalised by the Western academy and about seeking legitimacy for knowledge that is embedded in their own histories , experiences and ways of viewing reality . <p> It is about the formulation , legislation and dissemination of ethical issues related to the protection of indigenous knowledge systems . <p> Decolonisation accentuates the importance of teaching/learning in indigenous languages as part of the anti-imperialist struggle . <p> It relates to international scholars sharing common experiences , issues and struggles of colonised people in global and local spaces . <p> It is also concerned with a critical appraisal of the imperial model of the academy that continues to deny the colonised and historically marginalised other spaces to communicate from their own frames of reference . <p> Since inception , all South African universities adopted Western models of academic organisation which largely excluded and decimated the knowledge of black people . <p> The colonial model of academic organisation of the university , based on Western disciplinary knowledge , was entrenched during apartheid and has not been sufficiently transformed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ African universities , particularly in historically predominantly white universities , changed significantly , staff demographics have not changed in accordance . <p> This has ensured the preservation of colonial academic organisation , including curricula . <p> These colonial academic organisations also include historical legacies of capitalism , racism and patriarchy as intrinsic to institutional cultures and practices in Universities . <p> Recent events surrounding the #RhodesMustFall campaign have reinvigorated the need to transform these prevailing colonial academic organisations and to create African universities located in a national and regional context that centres the African and African knowledge and practices as vital to human relationships and growth . <p> The #RhodesMustFall campaign was not just about a statue but about the need to decolonise the institutional culture and practices of the university more broadly . <p> There is an urgent need to create new kind of academic institutions with new kind of public spaces premised on Constitutional principles of human dignity and equality . <p> Decolonizing the university starts with the de-privatization and rehabilitation of the public spaces . <p> It starts with a redefinition of what is public , i.e. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as such , does not belong to anyone in particular because it must be equally shared between equals . <p> The decolonization of buildings and public spaces includes a change of those colonial names , iconography , i.e. , the economy of symbols whose function , all along , has been to induce and normalize particular states of humiliation based on white supremacist presuppositions . <p> Such names , images and symbols have nothing to do on the walls of a public university campus more than 20 years into a democratic dispensation . <p> The biggest question when it comes to these issues is whether in their current form , they are relevant for the massive expansion of higher education in South Africa , which has opened up to students across race and class lines . <p> Some , if not many of these students do n't fit the profile of the typical rich and middle class , white , " university-ready " 18-year-old school leavers , but are students from rural and historically disadvantaged backgrounds , young adults some with families and responsibilities already , not so good basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the prospective employers is an issue of concern that universities need to consider when developing the curriculum , teaching and research methods . <p> For example , it is common knowledge that curriculum content is predominantly western , capitalist , heterosexual and dominated by European worldviews in South Africa . <p> It is necessary therefore that the content is changed to include the perspectives , experiences and epistemologies of Africa . <p> A clear strategy to tackle the issue of decolonisation of the curriculum , teaching and research needs to be developed . <p> It is clear that this will need different kinds of resources and expertise . <p> The unequal distribution of resources in higher education further compounds this predicament . <p> Serious consideration of a strong focus on rectifying this is necessary . <p> The risk of not having a clear strategy is that higher education will look no different 10 years down the line than what it is currently . <p> The Western model of academic organisation on which the South African university is based , remains largely unchallenged . <p> One way of challenging it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engagements to try and come up with answers . <p> Decolonisation involves fundamental rethinking and reframing of the curriculum and bringing South Africa and Africa to the centre of teaching , learning and research . <p> It 's time for Africa to tell its own stories in university classrooms . <p> Everyone , academics , students , workers , government officials , parents , business , the community and many more must come on board to ensure the success of reviewing and rethinking the curriculum to get to curriculum that incorporates epistemic perspectives , knowledge and thinking from the African continent and the global South into their teaching , research and community engagement . <p> So this is not to isolate South African universities from the rest of the world . <p> South African universities enjoy autonomy in a wide range of areas including the nature of the curriculum , teaching and research . <p> However , they have to be responsive to the constituencies they serve if they are to be relevant . <p> Efforts to decolonise the curriculum , teaching and focus of research must therefore be undertaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of university constituencies including students for whom curriculum , teaching and

programme to transform teaching , learning , researching and leading towards enhanced quality , success and equity in universities . <p> The programme formally started in January 2018 , although first steps were taken much earlier . <p> Teaching and research development at universities are key components of the UCDP and a range of programmes have been conceptualised and are being implemented to build capacity in these areas . <p> The UCDP is intended to enable an integrated approach to capacity development across three focus areas , namely : i ) student development ; ii ) staff development and iii ) programme/curriculum development . <p> The budget allocation for the UCDP is almost R1 billion for the 2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University Capacity Development Programme -- the New Generation of Academics Programme ( nGAP ) has gone from strength to strength , and is now a well-regarded capacity development programme in the sector that is making a difference . <p> Thus far , a

new nGAP posts will be made available . <p> The nGAP serves to recruit new academics which we hope will contribute to the issues of decolonisation . <p> The University Staff Doctoral Programme follows

@@30182233 <h> Mining companies turn to local content <p> Date : Oct 23 , 2018 , 17:47 <p> BY : Suleiman Mustapha <p> Category : Features <h> Although there is no legislation to enforce the use of locally sourced inputs by Ghana 's mining industry , the mining companies themselves are leading efforts to increase local content to the benefit of local enterprise and the wider economy . <p> At the middle of this decade , the country passed key legislations aimed at compulsorily making upstream oil and gas industry operators to increase their use of local input suppliers and the products and services they offer , to certain minimum thresholds . <p> The effort towards raising the use of local content in the oil and gas industry has been presented by government as one being done to prevent the long standing situation in the mining industry -- which is widely seen as an enclave one , dominated by foreign enterprises with very little linkage to local economic activity -- from being replicated in the oil and gas industry . <p> However this is somewhat misleading . While it is true that for most of the past century of gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this has been changing significantly over the past decade and indeed , over the past three or four years , local content has been increasing dramatically , propelled by deliberate affirmative action in this direction by the Chamber of Mines as an institution , its members , various stakeholder institutions and government itself . <p> Online portal <p> Key here has been the establishment of an online portal portal by the Ghana Chamber of Mines , in November last year , to promote its local content objectives by announcing its supply needs of its members which are available to local suppliers . <p> " The Chamber recognizes the challenges local businesses and entrepreneurs face in identifying opportunities in the value chain of mining and therefore built the online portal to provide adequate information on inputs required by mining companies " says Kwame Addo-Kufuor , the immediate past president of the chamber , and whose tenor in that position the online portal was established . <p> " While this is not an end in itself , it is an essential means to whip up public interest in the sector . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an integrated mining industry that will ensure that greater value from the industry remains in-country to increase local revenue generation , job opportunities and national development . " <p> Instructively , last year the chamber 's members achieved 73 per cent of its target for sourcing inputs locally , and following the establishment of the portal , they will get significantly closer to fully meeting the even higher targets set in this regard for 2018 . <p> These targets are set by the chamber and its members themselves in a self-regulatory initiative and the efforts are reaping major positive results . Mining companies now spend over one billion dollars a year on purchases of locally sourced products and services , excluding diesel and power and local spending is growing by the year . <p> Eight products , accounting for between 54 per cent and 60 per cent of mining firms ' purchases , have been deemed promising for local procurement and mining companies are supporting local suppliers and manufacturers to improve their capacities through financial and technical assistance . <p> Regulations have been introduced to promote local content . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the highest Ghanaian participation are given preference in the award of supply contracts where bids are within two per cent of each offer . <p> The Minerals Commission has responsibility for monitoring the mining companies to ensure that they source as much of their inputs as possible locally , mining companies are required to have their five year local procurement plans approved by the Minerals Commission and to submit compliance reports annually documenting the implementation of those plans . <p> A recent OECD report concurs that " There are strong mechanisms in place for monitoring and enforcement of local content provisions in Ghana . " <p> The mining companies themselves are enthusiastic about supporting improvements in local suppliers ' capacity and this is crucial ; their biggest worry regarding local content is about the shortcomings of local enterprise with regards to product and service quality , quantity and timelines . <p> A vivid example of such support is that given to Tema Steel Company , which has benefitted from assistance provided by both Goldfields Ghana and Newmont Mining . <p> Goldfields has been working with the company , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make it a reliable supplier and increase linkages with small and medium sized enterprises within the mining sector . <p> Similarly , pivotal support has been given to Tema Steel 's subsidiary West African Forging Limited , by Newmont Mining in its production of steel grinding media which is used to crush the gold bearing ore so as to extract the gold itself , and which hitherto was imported due to quality concerns . <p> Enthuses Yaw Boadi , the company 's technical and marketing director : " Aside helping us to improve our output and quality , we opened our third forge plant with the support of Newmont . Currently they are giving us a push to bring a fourth forge plant on stream to expand our capacity further . Also , with feedback from Newmont 's technical experts we have improved on our steel quality and forging safety . " <p> Long term business <p> Newmont has also , through its Ahafo linkages programme provided long term business support and training many indigenous business in the Ahafo communities to give them the competitive advantage for bigger contracts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the effort to increase local content in the mining industry . Mr Tony Oteng-Gyasi , who owns and runs Tropical Cables and Conductors complains that local enterprises , which have to pay import duties on their manufacturing inputs , find it difficult to be price competitive against imports which can be brought in duty free by mining companies that have agreements to that effect with government . <p> A recent joint-study by three institutions -- the Addis Ababa based African Minerals Development Centre ; the Accra based Africa Centre for Economic Transformation ACET ; and the Hanover , Germany headquartered Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources -- points towards other challenges such as Ghana 's structural weaknesses that impede its drive for economic diversification and industrialization , to many middlemen in the supply chain , which drives up prices and supply time , lack of political consensus on how to strengthen linkages between mining and industrialization , and too much bureaucracy in the business environment . <p> Suppliers ' development programme <p> Instructively , these three institutions are partnering the Chamber and government itself to design and promote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> All this requires a change of policy direction argues Eric Brown , ACET 's director of policy advisory services . " To build resilience against external shocks , the country has to transfer its economic structure by shifting from ' revenue first ' approach to the mining sector to the deepening of local content and value addition . " <p> Overcoming these challenges is another step towards increased local content and the consequent integration of the mining sector into the wider Ghanaian economy . But increased local supply itself is not the ultimate aim . <p> " As much as the Chamber is committed to true local content , it must go beyond the mere purchase of inputs from local suppliers and focus on local manufacturing " insists Kwame Addo-Kufuor . " Stimulating the economy would require a fast paced industrialization drive on the back of the mining industry with the potential of integrating the sector with other sectors .

After graduating from Columbia , she worked with Natalie Portman on " Black Swan , " and subsequently created her ballet-integrated exercise regimen .

And I had to learn , and it took a lot of trial and error for me to figure out the best system to take care of my body , to prevent injury , to feel my strongest , my leanest , and my best . <p> Once I left the company , I took a break from dancing . I needed time where I was n't in a dance studio , where I did n't have that pressure to look a certain way , to perform a certain way . And when I wanted to start working out I had gained weight , my body had changed . I also did n't want to go back into a ballet studio , I felt self-conscious .

One of the first Victoria 's Secret Angels that I worked with was Miranda Kerr , who is a long-time client and a very dear friend of mine . We 're still working together today . And it 's been fun to train with people like Miranda and like Lily Aldridge . Through having a baby , through , maybe , a second pregnancy . <p> For some people it 's through multiple seasons of doing a show like Victoria 's Secret , or a big film , or runway moment . But it 's been really exciting , too , for me , to take these women through some really momentous moments in their careers .

But certainly we are doing a really intensified version of the program . <p> A mutual friend that I had danced with , with New York City Ballet , connected me with Natalie . She was in town .

And it also brought ballet fitness into the press , into I think , the sort of lexicon of the everyday woman . <p> You do n't have to be a professional dancer or to have trained your body for a dozen years to experience ballet , to bring it into your home . You feel better , you have more energy . Your body feels stronger . You start to see results . It 's really , really motivating .

Sane offloaded the ball to Ilkay Gundogan and Sterling , occupying a harmless space between five home defenders with his back to goal , barely moved . When he did , it was to take two small steps forward into the " D " before he and City sprang to life . <p> A quick gesture to Gundogan , a sharp ball into feet , a one-touch lay-off later and within seconds , the Germany international had found the far corner .

Nobody in the division has made more " second assists " ( the key pass before an assist ) than his five , and Mohamed Salah is the only player to have touched the ball more inside opponents ' penalty boxes .

Sterling has become the player who , ever since he was plucked by Liverpool from Queens Park Rangers at 15 years of age , most had hoped he would be , bearing a heavy weight of scrutiny and unfair attention in the process . The moment has come to credit him for being a world-class player and for those that know him , it was always a matter of time . <p> " My opinion is that he 's currently in that top-five list of wingers you just would n't want to face , " says Frankie Sutherland , who played with Sterling at QPR from under-12 level until his departure for Anfield . <p> Sutherland now plays for English National League side Bromley and recently made a point discussing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he believes Sterling is , along with Harry Kane , one of England 's two best players and that everything is in place for him to be " classed among the world 's best . " <p> Sutherland notes that , at QPR , everything came easy to Sterling . He was playing two years above his age group at one stage , an uncanny core strength hidden within his diminutive frame . If defenders had n't already been left behind already , they 'd just bounce off him . <p> " He was always better than anyone else so he could just take the ball , beat four men and score , " says Sutherland . " I suppose he did n't have to think too much about his game , it all came naturally and he was always doing so well . <p> " It 's a real credit to him that at City he 's been taking on board what Pep Guardiola has said to him , and that he can go into a ' Pep team ' and play like that .

The brain can do the work , too , yet Sterling himself would say the process has not been complicated . <p> Speaking to a group of journalists last March , he said Guardiola " brings you back to what you used to do with the under-8s , " suggesting that the apparent complexity of City 's build-up play is born more of clarity than anything else . <p> In particular , Guardiola taught Sterling to improve his dribbling technique by opening his body to the ball rather than bringing it under his spell with the outside of his foot ; he has made other subtle tweaks to Sterling 's game , aware that his talent required nurturing rather than moulding .

" The first season , he was scared . He is more mature now than he was when we first met at the club . " <p> Sutherland describes a young player who was " quite quiet , no arrogance , no ego , the opposite of how he 's has been portrayed . " He says " everybody just wished him well as a person " when he left for Liverpool , not always something taken for granted in hyper-competitive academy environments .

" He was very much about discipline and I think we were probably among the last age groups that went through this older-school approach . You did your jobs and had to wear plain black boots . That helped us and helped Raheem . " <p> Gallen spoke admiringly of Sterling 's focus in an interview with QPR 's website back in 2014 . " Any time I chucked anything at him at QPR , a big step , he more than coped with it , " he said . <p> " Nothing really daunts him that much . When he was 14 , he played for the reserves against men . That 's just him -- chuck him into something , and he loves that kind of challenge .

Yet he 's managed to block out the background noise , the old instincts honed at QPR serving him well , and the excitement now lies in how far he can go from here . <p> Arsene Wenger once suggested that a forward will only begin to realise his full potential from the age of 23 . Sterling turns 24 on Dec. 8 and in that context , his achievements to date have been astonishing .

The highs and lows have been extreme but Sterling has emerged as one of the calmest , most composed , most clinical performers at precisely the time anyone would have expected . <p> " He came onto the scene so young and people do forget that due to the sheer number of games he 's played , which is testament to him , " Sutherland says .

Sadio Mane had converted the rebound , seemingly giving Liverpool a 1-0 lead at the Emirates , but a linesman 's flag had thwarted him . Mane had been offside when the initial pass was played , but was n't interfering with play . When he was interfering with play , in the second phase , he 'd been level with Roberto Firmino as the Brazilian volleyed towards goal . Mane was onside , the goal should have stood . <p> From the freeze-frames on the replay , we were looking at the position of Mane , the position of Firmino , and the position of the Arsenal defence . But not , crucially , at the nature of the pass . <p> It came from right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold . This was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition , or a hopeful lofted ball into the channel . No , instead Alexander-Arnold had checked inside , dribbled towards the centre of the pitch , and then dinked a perfect ball over the top , with his weaker left foot , to put two Liverpool attackers running through on goal . It 's the type of wrong-footed pass that even the Premier League 's most gifted playmakers might not have attempted , played to absolute perfection , by a 20-year-old right-back . <p> The last time Liverpool 's academy produced a player who enjoyed a spell in the first team at right-back , it was Jon Flanagan , who featured prominently during Liverpool 's near-miss of 2013-14 , attracting attention with his storming tackle . He was , somewhat ironically , nicknamed the " Scouse Cafu " . <p> If Alexander-Arnold is going to be compared to a legendary right-back , though , then it 's not Cafu but instead Philipp Lahm . The German World Cup-winning captain was renowned as a right-back , but he was equally comfortable playing on the opposite flank , and was later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed the optimum approach was to put the most intelligent , gifted players in the middle . Lahm , as it happens , had played central midfield in Bayern 's youth sides , and only shifted right because there were doubts about his level of physicality . <p> Alexander-Arnold might embark upon a similar experience . He was also a midfielder when rising through the youth ranks -- in truth , almost every top-class full-back was converted from a more attacking position at some stage -- and became a right-back only a couple of years ago , essentially , because he realised that 's where opportunities would present themselves in the first team . The more he plays right-back , though , the more it appears he belongs in a different position . <p> Which is n't to say that Alexander-Arnold has been exposed in defence . Only the trip to Naples this season stands out as a difficult game , and there have been many more success stories . In the 3-0 Champions League quarterfinal victory over Manchester City last season , Guardiola clearly tried to target Alexander-Arnold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a midfield diamond , one striker , and one winger -- Leroy Sane , playing high up against Alexander-Arnold . <p> Almost all City 's attacking play went through Sane , and every time Alexander-Arnold stood firm . In fact , not only that , but when Manchester City worked their most presentable opportunity of the game , teeing up David Silva for what looked like a tap-in from a right-wing pull-back , Alexander-Arnold darted inside , leaving his direct opponent Sane , to provide a crucial intervention in the middle . It showed a great level of footballing intelligence to cover for his teammates . <p> Trent Alexander-Arnold 's stunning free kick vs . Watford was just the latest highlight produced by the talented 20 year old . <p> Alexander-Arnold later suggested Sane is the toughest opponent he 's faced , but you would n't have known it . Since then he 's largely nullified Cristiano Ronaldo in a Champions League final and outplayed Neymar at Anfield , not merely by getting his foot in , but also by bursting past on the overlap and exposing the Brazilian 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right-backs can tackle and sprint , but Alexander-Arnold stands out for his technical quality . There was that left-footed chip against Arsenal , there was a lovely outside-of-the-boot ball into Sadio Mane against West Ham earlier this season , and a well-weighted curling ball down the line for Mohamed Salah 's opener against Fulham this month . <p> He also regularly attempts driven crossfield balls to the opposite flank , and has scored two goals in his last two games -- a driven , powerful side-footed effort into the far corner in England 's victory over the United States , and then a dipping free-kick which curled into the net away at Watford . Alexander-Arnold boasts more technical quality than we 've come to expect from a right-back , traditionally the less flashy , more solid cousin of the more exotic left-back . <p> Playmaking skills have become more important from full-backs over the last couple of years . Pundits still talk about the nature of " modern full-backs " , expected to overlap and provide crossing qualities , but realistically that concept has become long-established . <p> What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passes from deep positions , against teams who form compact blocks in the centre of the pitch , denying central defenders and central midfielders time on the ball . The full-backs have a little more space , and usually a full view of the pitch . <p> That recent trip to Arsenal was an interesting game in this respect , with both sides ' full-back pairings attempting ambitious passes into the channels on a regular basis . Alexander-Arnold is fully capable of bending clever balls around defenders into onrushing forwards , and in that respect shares a similarity with Cesar Azpilicueta , or perhaps even Kevin De Bruyne , who are entirely different players but have recently shown a fondness for curling balls from deep , centre-right positions . <p> Alexander-Arnold has also made headlines recently for daring to take on world chess champion Magnus Carlsen -- lasting 17 moves before the inevitable defeat . Along those lines , it 's becoming clear that Alexander-Arnold is n't merely a rook , starting wide and waiting for opportunities to burst up the touchline , but that he is also capable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the central playmaking potential of a queen . He 's already a top-class right-back , but if he keeps playing like he has he might not stay there for long .

@@30304234 <p> The Ghana Cocoa Board ( COCOBOD ) has strongly denied claims by the Minority in Parliament about misusing the first tranche of the $1.3 billion cocoa syndicated loan for the 2018/19 crop year . <p> The Ranking Member of the Finance Committee of parliament , Cassiel Ato Forson said the first tranche of $650 million of the $1.3 billion facility is supposed to be used to finance the smooth operations of Licensed-Buying Companies ( LBCs ) , especially the Produce Buying Company ( PBC ) to ensure that the cocoa farmer is paid on time , but the funds have not been used for the intended purpose . <p> He claims the money has been diverted into areas that will not benefit the cocoa farmer in any way . <p> But COCOBOD , in a statement described the allegation as as " misinformation and attempts by a section of the public and political actors to incite cocoa farmers and other stakeholders to a situation of mistrust towards the Board . " <p> Read Full Statement <p> The attention of Ghana Cocoa Board ( COCOBOD ) has been drawn to what it considers misinformation and attempts by a section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other stakeholders to a situation of mistrust towards the Board . <p> We would like to urge cocoa farmers in particular , stakeholders and the general public to ignore such claims . The statement raised by the minority does not cover the real issues , but mainly seeks to create an erroneous impression that COCOBOD has diverted the funds meant for cocoa purchase into investments at the expense of cocoa farmers . <p> We wish to state the facts as follows : <p> * The Ghana Cocoa Board drew the first tranche of USD650 million on 4th October , 2018 from the USD1.3 billion syndicated trade facility for cocoa purchases . <p> *Per the rules of the internal marketing of cocoa , COCOBOD has allocated Seed Fund to deserving Licensed Buying Companies for cocoa purchases . <p> *To ensure the safety of public funds , individual LBCs are required to submit bank guarantee to access the Seed Funds to make prompt payments to the farmers for cocoa purchases . <p> * Per the recommendations of the Producer Price Review Committee ( PPRC ) , COCOBOD , within thirteen days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Centres the full value ( producer price , buyers ' margin and evacuation ) to allow the companies to return the cash to the field for cocoa purchases . <p> *By these arrangements , LBCs operating without any challenges with their bankers should NOT encounter difficulties in accessing the funds from their bank accounts to make prompt payments for cocoa purchases . <p> *There are over 30 LBCs involved in cocoa purchases this season of which PBC is a part . PBC submitted bank guarantees up to GH ? 390 million which qualified them , and COCOBOD duly released the GH ? 390 million to the company at the beginning of the 2018/19 season to pay cocoa farmers . <p> *Further , COCOBOD has approved additional Seed Fund of GH ? 150 million to PBC and reimbursed the company GH ? 147 million out of the initial GH ? 390 million that they received at the beginning of the season . <p> *In total , PBC has been allocated GH ? 687 million for cocoa operations . This amount is sufficient to purchase 90,523.07 tonnes of cocoa . <p> *Per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the initial GH ? 390 million for cocoa purchases . An outstanding amount of GH ? 60 million released on 30th October 2018 remains unaccounted for by PBC . <p> *From the foregoing analysis , without any challenges with their bankers , the PBC should possess the financial capacity to pay cocoa farmers without delays . <p> *As our mandate to protect the public purse demands , COCOBOD is obliged to ensure safer disbursement of the Seed Fund . We shall not disburse Seed Funds without a security . <p> *To enable the LBCs that encounter difficulties in securing bank guarantees to access Seed Funds , we have concluded arrangements with the insurance commission so that qualifying insurance companies can step in and assist other companies with seed fund guarantee . <p> *The claim by the Centre for Socioeconomic Studies ( CSS ) findings suggest that COCOBOD has " either refused , neglected , or failed to allocate funds to the Licensed Buying Companies , especially Produce Buying Company " is incorrect . <p> *As a professional research agency , CSS should have contacted COCOBOD for the facts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only succeed at creating unnecessary tensions . <p> *We do not invest monies earmarked for cocoa purchases with the banks . Currently , we have sufficient funds to pay for cocoa purchases from the farmers . <p> *We call on individual LBCs to maintain good working relationships with their banks and ensure that Seed Funds paid into their bank accounts are used to pay for cocoa purchased from farmers . <p> *COCOBOD is available to respond to public enquiries concerning the internal cocoa marketing and other operational areas of the industry . <p> *We wish to assure our cherished cocoa farmers and industry stakeholders that their interest will always be protected .

@@30304238 <p> I followed him after we had slapped our right palms and snapped thumbs with index fingers . He tittuped ahead , bobbing his head in the manner of an agitated rooster while gliding his legs as if he were jauntily practicing some latest dance steps . All at once , he swiveled and spanked the guilty thought which had caused the apparent oversight off his forehead and reached out for my left hand in a courteous bid to relieve me of my heavy Echolac suitcase . In convention , I hesitated and mumbled he should n't bother but he ignored my insincere objection and grabbed the suitcase from my deadened hand . <p> As we plodded along the incline of the road which led directly to the boarding house , transuding sweat mapped the back of his white shirt down to the boundary where it tucked into the belt loop of his brown trousers . I felt prickled with regret for having packed my clothes , books and provisions all into that one suitcase . <p> ' Owelewa ! ' he called when we reached the purlieu of the dormitories , his loud voice vibrating my absentminded membrane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our encounter even though I had reckoned by his uniform that like me , he , too , was a Sixth Former . <p> ' Apache ! ' he called again while he set down my suitcase near the door to a room . ' Apache ! ... Martin Owelewa ! Ah , where d ? m pass ? ' He sucked his teeth and dance-stepped unceremoniously away from view , still calling out those names . Owelewa . <p> Its timbre rang like a Yoruba word so I divined he must be Nigerian , whoever he was . He reappeared after seconds had almost indexed a minute and made a signal at me to come inside . <p> A chair which shouldered a purple shirt around its crest rail as a hanger sited at the left side of the entrance , and I buckled onto it without any prompt , enervated , but now grateful in the grasp of the room 's welcoming cool sheltering us within the envelope of the hostile hot weather . <p> ' Charley , but your suitcase , e be concrete you gather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reproach . <p> We squealed in warmhearted laughter and slapped palms harder than we did earlier . <p> He donned a pair of sunglasses in a James Bond-esque suave within the bonhomie and introduced himself with imperious conviction : ' I be Jagger Pee . ' <p> Ei , Jagger Pee ! So here he was : the devious-reputed stager who starred in the theatre of immora l dramas promptly propagated within the secondary schools in our region of the country ! His wiry structure , coupled with his genial effusion , chided my imagination for the wrong image it had <p> sculpted him in those stories . Why did he respond ' I know ' to my introduction when we definite ly had n't met before ? Who were those characters he was seeking , and why must his preoccupation with them take precedence over the formal enquiries usually conducted after introductions ? <p> My odorant receptors detected the unmistakable suspicion of Drakkar Noir and the fragrance deviated my mind off Jagger Pee onto a prying course of its source . It seemed to stem from the shirt which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I quivered with the flame of fondness the scent sparked within , for even though I did n't particularly care for it , the perfume was my bosom friend Martin Nii Atukwei Wellington 's favourite . <p> My calm creek of curiosity erupted into a rapturous geyser of recognition when I turned and scanned the shirt . It was his ! I needed no effort in finding his antiquated , brown leather suitcase within the Spartan room to complete the confirmation . It sat on a locker wedged in the corner of the wall to my right . It also implied the concealed presence of his Panasonic boom box . I scurried across to the bed set closer to the locker and peered under the pillowed end . Saskoberta ! The boom box was set exactly where I imagined he would ensconce it . Steamed in excitement , I collapsed onto his bed and laughed out loud . <p> Martin Nii Atukwei Wellington - or Martin Wellington , as we , his peers , referred to him - and I have been friends since our late childhood . Before then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys who would show up for Saturday-morning football matches on the gravelly stretch of the street which also situated Uncle Ewusie 's newsstand a safe distance from our makeshift stadium . <p> While the others usually rushed to grab the privileges punctuality provided with pre-match selection , Martin Wellington and I would lag and linger at the newsstand , entranced by the colourful cartooned tabloids that garlanded it . Uncle Ewusie promptly took advantage of our enticed presence one such Saturday morning by having us run deliveries for him after which he rewarded us with fresh copies of Laugh and Laugh with Homotta Fun Time and Joy-Ride . <p> We got transformed from colt footballers to studious enthusiasts . Uncle Ewusie kvelled for his ostensible sowing of scholastic seeds in us and we , in turn , availed ourselves for errands just to sustain our access to his tabloids and back numbers . <p> Martin Wellington and I then became inseparable friends , bonded by an unappeasable appetite for stories and a mutual taste in the literary dishes we procured . We later became fast fans of Merari Alomele 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' : a crafty tactic of skimming a column in a newspaper for sale with no intent of honouring our transactional onus . <p> Referrals and discussions of novels constituted the major contents of our correspondences within the early years of our O-Level tenure . We guzzled Pacesetters flock of stories and did not dispute Philip Phil-Ebosie 's The Cyclist being the stand out narrative . We adored the spectacular manner Cameron Duodu projected a familiar setting in his thrillingly entertaining tale , The Gab Boys and since we also thought the novel more than held its own comparatively with those that consisted the library-accessible , Heinemann 's marquee African Writers Series , we wondered why it did not come as an inclusion . <p> Literature revealed a profound secret to us along the way : ravenous reading somehow begets a tendency to write ! The contents of our correspondences soon transitioned from a cannonade of discussions into sporadic exchanges of our own short story and poetry attempts when O -Level 's final year approached . Our fledgling authorship influenced a critical decision during the short Christmas vacation we convened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We would choose the same school for our Sixth-Form course because our collaborative intent necessitated nearness . Our plans materialized but fate would present me a present which , in value , seemed as fortifying and as impeding as a direct-free-kick wall to a jittery goalkeeper . <p> Within the juncture we gained admission , my distaff uncle who had long been domiciled in the United Kingdom proposed I join him pronto since his own children were now grown and gone on marital and occupational calls . Mom was ecstatic , dad was unenthusiastic , and I was the confused amalgam of the polarity , both ecstatic and unenthusiastic ! I shared my mother 's happiness in the perceived prestige of going abroad . While I saw the sense <p> in my father 's insistence on the completion of my A-Levels before the commitment to any move , <p> my half-heartedness was kindled really by its adverse implication on our authorship plans and a disinclination to miss attending Sixth Form at home . <p> Other than the transitioning from the sartorial simplicity of knickers to the splendor of trousers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us the laurel wreath of O -Levels ' success and the <p> Lower also fueled my dissuasion . We had witnessed the panache and hijinks that characterized our predecessors within the Lower-Sixth era , so it seemed incredibly insane to even be contemplating sacrificing such long-coveted prizes on the opportunity-cost altar in the advent of the epoch . On the day we made our way towards the Lava Limited area of downtown Accra to purchase <p> suitcases right after we had completed the copious documentary requisition of our admissio n , Martin Wellington 's excited but opportunistic response contrasted my expectations when I <p> apprised him of the development : he would procure a boom box , UB40 's Labour of Love album and some Drakkar Noir with the money allotted for his suitcase and then I would hand him mine as a parting gift ' when I leave . ' <p> When I leave ! But what about the plans for our authorship collaboration ? The look he gave me said it all : Boy , you must be out of your mind to even consider scrapping such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrench as it became apparent travel preparations on both ends might actually take the better part of the year . Skeptical of the deal 's fruition , Dad insisted I did not have the option of loafing at home in the seeming interim . Mom , on the other hand , was disapproving of my relocation to school since she basically feared my interest in the whole affair might dwindle and die altogether if I did . <p> So , a good three weeks into the academic term , I dragged my addled self one Friday morning , on her blind side , and made for campus to see that one person whose potential advice , I surmised , should suffice to solve the nodus . <p> ' Frank Otu ! Frank Otu ! ... SP ! ' , a masculine voice projected from some distance behind me when I reached the ingress of the two-storeyed administration block and I twirled , conjecturing someone was mistaking me for someone else . A middle-aged man dressed in long-sleeved white shirt and some kind of navy-blue trousers beckoned . As my hesitant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniform appeared from behind and scurried past me in likewise route . <p> I realised then , contrary to my mistaken- identity assumption , the man 's calls and gesture must have been directed at the fellow who had apparently been located on the upper floor . I retraced my steps to the veranda upstairs and briefly observed their t ? te- ? -t ? te before I settled in the reception area adjoining the headmaster 's office . <p> The fellow appeared some minutes later and knocked on the headmaster 's door . Without waiting for a response , he fully depressed the door handle and nudged the locked wooden barrier . He sighed and turned attentively to the reception area . An acknowledging smile of my presence broke in his cheeks and rippled away the frustration of the headmaster 's absence from his face . He then tended to me and we slapped palms . <p> My facial expression must have registered my incomprehension because he asked again , this time gesturing his right thumb over his shoulder at the headmaster 's door . <p> ' You dey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I replied . <p> ' You get appointment ? ' <p> I wagged my head to imply no . <p> The smile vanished from his visage . <p> ' Ei , Charley ! But you ... ' <p> ' SP ! ... SP ! ' the masculine voice from downstairs interrupted him . <p> ' Yieee , so this man no go make I breath small ? ' he groused . <p> ' Frank Otu ! ' the voice rang again . <p> ' Sir ! Please I 'm coming , ' he shouted and scampered down the stairs . <p> Frank Otu . The senior prefect . His name did not ring a bell but his face had struck me as familiar . <p> Either I had seen him somewhere before or he very much resembled someone whose identity I could not immediately recollect . No worry . Since he also had business with Billy Goat , I presumed <p> he would be back in some minutes or so after he 'd settled whatever issue there was with the pestering man for us to get properly acquainted . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did the headmaster . I froze at the sound of feet shuffling up the stairs just as I had begun making my way to the notice board area so to rev circulation in my legs and kill some waiting time at the same time . A cornrowed-headed lass , sable-skinned and skinny as a scarecrow showed up with another in tandem . <p> ' Aswad ! ' the second one exclaimed and moved closer to hug me even before I identified her . ' Adelaide Adjei , ' she introduced herself with the fervour of one who had found a long-lost friend . ' Roberta Coffie , ' she said and pointed at the cornrowed-headed one whom I proceeded to greet by a handshake . <p> I stepped back and examined this Adelaide Adjei , wondering where and how we had been acquainted for her to ease up to me with such vim and verve . <p> ' I am a friend of your cousin , Eudora . We first met over a year ago at the Accra Workers ' College when you accompanied her for registration , ' she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Of course , I had not forgotten that day when my garrulous elder cousin had inveigled me into coming along with her for her own business . She reinforced my resentment when she had spent a bigger chunk of the time parading me around to the numerous members of her swooning-friends association which , by inference , must have included this Adelaide Adjei . No way under that circumstance was I now going to remember her particularly . <p> ' Are you here to see the headmaster ? ' she asked . <p> I nodded affirmatively . <p> ' On appointment ? ' <p> ' No . ' <p> She and her friend exchanged impressions of unease on their faces before they moved and sank into seats in the reception area . I sauntered away to scan the notice board , my mood not permitting the conventionally appropriate deed of staying and engaging them in chitchat . <p> The headmaster , Mr. Albert Nunoo , presently arrived and had them in and out of his office within <p> ten minutes . Because Adelaide Adjei and Roberta Coffie walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible thought of waving good bye in my direction - I deduced a positive outcome of their rendezvous . <p> I walked back to the reception area and paced back and forth . That the headmaster did not attend to people without a prior arrangement had become transpicuous from my brief interactions with the senior prefect and the girls . <p> So , what was I to do now ? Find his secretary somewhere in this block and make an appointment for another time , or summon enough courage and go in in spite of the condition he might well be waiting to engage those who had set up this time with him ? <p> Yet imprisoned by my abiding dithering , the pestering man turned up with a lady who also bore the appearance of a school official , and knocked on the headmaster 's door . I heard him invite them in . <p> They promptly entered but the lady apparently misjudged shutting the door properly behind her because the content of what was to ensue spilled clearly through the tiny opening into the area , turning me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a resolution . <p> ' I want us to talk about what happened last Saturday night , ' the headmaster set the meeting in motion when they had exchanged customary morning greetings and taken seats . <p> ' Something serious enough to keep me still embittered . I am the entertainment master in the school and anything concerning entertainment is under my jurisdiction . You have no right to go there and scatter the students ! ' <p> ' I have every right as far as the girls are concerned because I am the senior housemistress ! ' the lady retorted . ' Entertainment for the students is supposed to end at nine thirty after which I expect every girl to be in bed . But I went to the girls ' hostel at nine forty p.m. and there was not a single girl in bed ! ' <p> ' Still , you should have consulted me before going there on your own powers ! ' the entertainme nt master protested . <p> ' Well , I did what was right because I was expecting every master to do his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior housemistress . <p> Whew ! <p> I espied the senior prefect within the periphery of my left vision , arms folded across his chest , wryly smiling and listening in to the happening . The shock of the fiery exchanges barraging in the <p> office had evidently rendered me nescient to the announcing sound of any advancing presence . ' Please , please ! I did not call you here to come and quarrel with each other , ' the headmaster steered the skirmish along a pacific direction . ' I have sent for the senior prefect and the entertainme nt prefect . They should be here soon . ' <p> Cued Frank Otu knocked on the door and shut it properly upon entering the office in response to the headmaster 's invitation . The males ' elocution then emerged marginally muffled but the loudness of the female 's unyielding assertiveness would not be subdued in any notable measure by the fastened barrier . <p> ' Entertainment was hardly in progress ! When I got there , SP , there was only a handful of students in the assembly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very dark places . Some were even lurking at the forbidden place they call ... what do you call it ? ... Devil 's Corner ! ' she averred . <p> ' Well Mr. Nunoo , since it has been established that the fault lies with someone else , I think I better get out to the classroom ; I have a lesson in progress , ' she concluded and emerged with the crestfallen entertainment master behind her after what must have been an admonishment of sort from the headmaster . <p> It was only the senior prefect 's exclamation of ' Jagger Pee ' which jolted me from the aftershock of their fierce conflict . <p> In the peculiar manner Adelaide Adjei and Roberta Coffie did earlier , Frank Otu , too , hastened from the headmaster 's office , bubbling within a bubble of excitement and hurried away from the premises , essentially snipping my one prospective means of relaying my presence , as I intended , to Martin Wellington who had since settled on campus . <p> I discarded my mantle of diffidence , knocked on Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I greeted and spewed the story of my quandary to him in a well-orchestrated , delivery-before-reaction strategy . <p> The hardheaded headmaster predictably perorated on his appointment-before- meeting principle plus the immediate and potential consequences of my indecisiveness in moving to school : by now , I had most likely lost my dormitory-allocated bed and risked losing my admission status altogether to another on his waiting list if I did not relocate to campus - my ' UK predicament ' notwithstanding - by the end of the succeeding week !

He has an an amazing ability to just plough his way through . " <p> Curiously , though , Barca and Ronaldo 's future could have been much different had Robson landed his original target . <p> " I wo n't lie , I was tempted to buy English players and very nearly bought Alan Shearer at Barcelona , " he later told Four Four Two . <p> " We needed a centre-forward and the chairman asked if I knew one .

" <p> While the Catalans certainly did not lack the financial muscle to land Ronaldo following the failure to sign Shearer , reaching the young striker proved rather more difficult . <p> Enter Joan Gaspart , Josep Nunez 's No. 2 at Camp Nou and later president in his own right . The official came up with a novel way to break the ring of steel around Barca 's transfer target and convince him into a move . <p> " I even had to disguise myself to seal his signature , " Gaspart revealed to Goal . <p> " It did n't take long to reach agreement with PSV . The fee back then was 1,500,000,000 pesetas - around ? 15 million in today 's money . <p> " But the agreement had a little problem : we needed to get the player 's agreement and we needed it before July 15 , because that was when the pact with PSV was set to expire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gaspart had to take drastic measures to keep the move alive . <p> " PSV realised they did n't want to lose the player and they called the CBF in order to stop Ronaldo signing for Barca , " added Gaspart , who had no knowledge of the sudden change of heart upon travelling to Brazil to seal the deal . <p> " There were two security guards that did n't want me to go through and see Ronaldo or any other player .

@@30323230 <p> The loss , according to IES , was occasioned by a bad sale and purchase agreement between the management of TOR and British Petroleum ( BP ) . <p> It said TOR , on October 19 , 2018 , took delivery of some 950,000 barrels of crude oil for processing after several months of inactivity and IES alleged the refined product is now stranded in tanks due to the failure of TOR to find off-takers for the product . <p> IES in the statement said TOR has already lost about $24.13 million as a result of the failure to adopt the appropriate hedging method coupled with the decline in the price of oil on the world market . <p> The attention of the Management of Tema Oil Refinery has been drawn to a December 2 , 2018 article published in some sections of the media by the Institute for Energy Security IES , under the heading - " TOR PLUNGED FURTHER INTO TROUBLED WATERS , " and responds to the article as follows : <p> 1 . The assertion that the company has incurred a $24 million loss as a result of the drastic reduction in the prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is based on flawed assumption that there is a direct correlation between the drop in global prices and the price of TOR products on the local market . For the avoidance of doubt , a fall in the international crude oil price does not necessarily correspond to an equal degree of fall in the prices of petroleum products . The projection by IES thereby does not hold . <p> 2 . IES 's additional claim that TOR did not employ suitable techniques in managing the risk of a fall in price is untrue . Whereas the volatile nature of crude oil prices lies beyond the control of Tema Oil Refinery , any potential price risk arising from such volatility is however mitigated in a special arrangement with our suppliers . <p> 3 . The additional claim that there is no sight of the next parcel of crude for TOR is equally false . IES operates outside TOR and can not therefore be privy to all of TOR 's cargo dealing . Expected receipts of TOR 's cargo are in accordance with our program and should lead to a receipt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 4 . Contrary to the claims by IE , we wish to state that the interest of local off-takers in our products is paramount . TOR has sold some of the already refined products to both local and foreign entities . Additionally pipeline efforts for the export of TOR products remain unchanged . <p> Management of Tema Oil Refinery refutes the various allegations which were contained in the said IES article . We take this opportunity to advise IES not to jeopardize the long term business model between TOR and our strategic partners with stories that can not be substantiated . <p> 1 . The euphoria and excitement that greeted the arrival of the 950,000 net US Barrels of Bonny Light supplied by British Petroleum ( BP ) , and aboard the vessel " British Heritage " on 19th October 2018 ; have been erased . Hopes that the Tema Oil Refinery ( TOR ) will run uninterrupted and make money have proven short-lived . <p> 2 . A loss of $24 million plus after processing just 950,000 barrels of crude is enough to plunge TOR into further debt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unit ( CDU ) on the morning of Friday 30th November 2018 , as there was no sight of the next parcel of crude . <p> 3 . It is sad to note that the managers of the refinery failed to adequately find off-takers for the refined products before sourcing for the crude , thus rendering the products " stranded " in tanks . This bizarre business module means the refinery will make further losses as prices keep falling on the global commodity market . <p> 4 . Lack of understanding of global volatile oil market , failure to consult , laxity , poor planning , and carelessness ; are but a few of reasons underpinning the huge financial loss to the state . In brief , bad trading decisions on the part of management have caused the current loss . <p> 5 . To mitigate the risk of backwardation when signing the sales and purchase agreement ( SPA ) , management of TOR should have employed the most suitable hedging technique capable of managing the risk of a fall in price . Leaving the quotation of the price at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before or 5 trading days after Bill of Lading ( BL ) , and fall in the price of crude ; are the reasons that have increased Tema Oil Refining crude price exposure . Meanwhile , a document sighted by IES suggest that crude sale price was determined based on a 90-day average , and not around BL ; for the same supplier in the past . <p> 6 . Price quotation 5 trading days before BL ( 16th October 2018 ) and 5 trading days after BL stood at $81.912 per barrel and $79.078 per barrel respectively . At $81.912 per barrel plus a " Suppliers Premium " of $3.0 per barrel , the probable quoted price by the Seller for a barrel of the Bonny Light crude is $84.912 . <p> 7 . The fall in quoted crude price since then to $59.510 per barrel ( recorded at close 29:11:18 ) , leaves a corresponding price loss of $25.402 per barrel ; which translates into $24.13 million for the 950,000 barrels . The loss excludes the structural cost in handling the crude before processing , cost of TOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Collateral Manager to monitor stock levels , cost of processing the crude etc . <p> 8 . The Institute for Energy Security ( IES ) wish to call on Government and the Ministry of Energy ( MoE ) to investigate the circumstances leading to this huge financial loss to the state and the Ghanaian taxpayer and bring punitive action against the perpetrators whose action only adds on to the country 's energy debt . <p> 9 . The intervention of government is necessary in order to forestall the recurrence of this unfortunate and avoidable mess . And that the management of TOR should not be allowed to authorize or sign such key agreement on behalf of the state , as its action smacks of mismanagement and incompetence .

The Gunners have n't beaten United at their home in the league since 2006 , unable to defeat their old enemy even in the very darkest days of their post-Ferguson funk . <p> Their best chance of doing that might be to make full use of a player who wo n't be around for too much longer . Unai Emery confirmed at the weekend that the decision not to offer Aaron Ramsey a new contract is final , and the Welshman will be leaving , either in January or next summer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game after coming off the bench against Spurs , setting up two goals and generally being the sort of dynamic presence that fits with this new Arsenal . <p> As United have shown a few times this season , they can crumble if a team goes at them , which combined with their defensive problems ( Jose Mourinho picked Scott McTominay and Nemanja Matic at the back in the 2-2 draw with Southampton ) points to an aggressive approach being the way to go . <p> Ramsey 's rise to prominence coincides with the brilliant form of Arsenal 's two strikers , with Alexandre Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang notching up three more goals at the weekend . So how about an ambitious forward line of those two , with Ramsey just behind them ? It would be a bold move , but the way things are going under Emery , he seems bold enough to make it . <p> Aaron Ramsey was pivotal in Arsenal 's victory over Tottenham . <p> Should Spurs be worried about Lloris ? <p> It 's been nearly seven years now that Tottenham , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could at least rely on their goalkeeper . Hugo Lloris was the comfort blanket they needed , so reliable that they had one less thing to worry about , but France 's World Cup-winning captain has now become something of a concern . <p> Just this season his mistakes have cost them in the Champions League and at home : games against Barcelona , Crystal Palace , PSV and Cardiff spring instantly to mind as ones where he has been erratic . <p> Against Arsenal too , Lloris 's confused decision-making showed itself , this time in a more subtle way . His limp attempts at saving their second and third goals was not the only problem with Tottenham 's performance against their rivals , but the thought that their defenders can no longer entirely rely on the man behind them is a significant concern for coach Mauricio Pochettino , at a time when Spurs need all the help they can get to keep pace with those around them . <p> Liverpool could do with a convincing performance <p> Being more mature , winning while playing badly , enjoying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season what you will , it 's certainly impressive that they 've managed to keep on Manchester City 's coattails , as Pep Guardiola 's side strides imperiously through the Premier League season . <p> At some point , though , it would be nice to see them truly blow an opponent away , rather than grinding out the points . Jurgen Klopp wants to move away from being irresistible one minute then fragile the next , which is entirely understandable . But at this stage they have managed to eke out points while appearing slightly unconvincing . <p> What better team than Burnley to reverse that ? Sean Dyche 's men are only a point off the bottom having lost five of their last six , and are shipping goals at a prodigious rate . Mohamed Salah , Sadio Mane , Roberto Firmino and Co. will rarely have a juicier opportunity . <p> Ruben Loftus-Cheek continues to be among the goals for Chelsea . <p> Will Loftus-Cheek get his chance ? <p> Perhaps we focus too much on Ruben Loftus-Cheek because he 's an increasingly rare Englishman in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else the midfielder can do to get a regular run-out for Chelsea . <p> His strike against Fulham was his fifth goal in his last six appearances , and while three of those were against BATE Borisov in the Europa League , he 's been doing exactly what a fringe player should do : impressing on the rare occasions when he is picked . <p> Loftus-Cheek will reportedly make a decision about his immediate future soon , and may seek another loan away from Stamford Bridge in January , but that might depend on mow many more chances Maurizio Sarri gives him . He deserves more , certainly . <p> Has the Wolves bubble burst ? <p> It must have been easy for those around Wolves -- the players , the fans , the hot dog sellers -- to get a little carried away with the hype surrounding them in the opening weeks of the season . Talk that Nuno Espirito Santo 's side were the best team to ever get promoted to the Premier League was giddy but not without basis , given how they played in those first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've lost five of the last six , all of a sudden their defence looks shaky and therefore their toothless attack ( just 13 goals in 14 games ) is further exposed .

If they can get that , and attack their visitors , they might still have a chance . But if they play as meekly has they have been , their slip down the table will continue .

" We are wired for attachment and also for new experiences , " says licensed marriage and family therapist David Klow , owner of Skylight Counseling Center in Chicago . " When we can have a bit of both by getting back together with a former lover , many of us jump at the opportunity . " <p> Plus , it 's just easier than spending hours swiping through Bumble . " We often are n't interested in someone new because we have to get to know someone new and that takes time , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : 6 Simple Steps to a New and Happy Relationship and professor at Oakland University in Michigan . " When with our ex , we already know what we like , or do n't like , and how they act . " <p> It 's possible to have more success with round two , Klow says-you just need to approach it the right way . Here 's how to get back with your ex without making a total mess of it . <h> 1 . Slow the eff down <p> Yes , it 's super-exciting that you and your ex are hanging again . But , while Klow says there 's no proven formula for what speed you should move at , it does n't hurt to slow down and take a beat before you slap a label on things again . That gives you time to ... <h> 2 . Figure out what you want <p> Orbuch says this is your chance to lay all of your cards out on the table , so do n't be afraid to get real about what you need to be happy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in a relationship , as well as what qualities you need from a partner . <p> You 'll also want to have your deal breakers in mind . " Then , share these expectations with your former partner and have your former partner do the same and share the list with you , " Orbuch says . " This is important for all couples to do together , but even more important when you reconnect with a former partner . Be open and honest . " <h> 3 . Go ahead and view it as a new relationship <p> " Yes , you 've already dated and know one another , but time changes people , " Orbuch says . " So , get to know your former partner again , ask questions , see what they think and feel . " <p> This time around Orbuch suggests getting to know the person your partner is today , and checking that their underlying values and attitudes are the same as yours-not the opposite . " Partners who share similar attitudes and values are more likely to stay together over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have different interests , hobbies , or friends , but it 's the underlying values that need to be similar . " <h> 4 . Talk about what you did when you were apart <p> Now 's the time to speak up if you were with someone while you two were broken up . You do n't have to go into details . A simple , " I dated someone for a few months " is good enough-unless that someone was his best friend/coworker or anyone else that might trigger hurt or jealousy . <p> It 's important to at least mention it so that there are no surprises down the road , Klow says . If your guy is upset about it ( even though , hello , you were n't together anymore ) , then talk about it and address any concerns or fears-and then move on . <h> 5. ... and why you want to get back together <p> Are you frustrated because your last date tried to floss his teeth with a strand of your hair after dinner , or do you really think there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? If it 's the former , Klow says that 's not a great reason to run back to your ex . But if it 's the latter , go for it . <h> 6 . Listen to your intuition <p> If you found yourself ignoring some major issues the last time the two of you were a pair , then Orbuch says it 's important to nix that behavior . <p> " Perhaps last time you were in the relationship with your ex , you did n't see the red flags or did n't listen to your gut , " she says . " Maybe you thought things would change , you did n't believe in yourself or know what you wanted . " If you 're giving it a second go , be sure you also trust your instincts if things start to backslide again . <h> 7 . Cover old issues <p> So , heads up : It 's pretty likely that old fights and problems are going to crop up again-it 's best to get ahead of them . You do n't have to reenact your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind it , plus what you 're going to do to avoid another one of those in the future . Talking about it when you 're both calm is key , says Klow , since you 're much more likely to get somewhere . " It is important for a couple to build on the past relationship , warts and all , " says Klow. <h> 8 . Have a trust chat <p> " Given that the two of you have a past , trust has most likely been broken , " Orbuch says . " In many relationships , breakups occur because one or both of the partner have betrayed the other . And , trust , once it 's broken , is very hard to rebuild . " <p> Because of that , Orbuch recommends couples looking to rekindle their relationship have a trust chat where you discuss what it means to trust one another and list realistic expectations for the relationship , as well as answer " what is fidelity and what does it mean to each of us as we go forward ? " <p> During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your definition is of commitment . " These are all questions that should be addressed in any relationship as you move forward , and even more so if you 're getting back with an ex , " Orbuch says . <h> 9 . Do nt expect everyone to be on board <p> Just because you 're ready to move on with an ex , that does n't mean your family or BFF will be quite as keen on the idea . " They will remember what was bad about your ex , " Orbuch says . " And , most likely because you 've spoken negatively about the former partner to them , they will bring it up again as you announce to them about getting back together . " <p> When that happens , Orbuch says it 's important to remember that they have your best interests at heart . She recommends meeting their concerns with this : " I hear you . I understand your concerns . I appreciate you telling me . " Follow it up with the things that have changed about your ex and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can also fill them in on your plan moving forward . <h> 10 . Know what youre getting into <p> Sure , people change , but they 're usually more likely to stay the same . Basically , do n't think that things will be different after the " getting to know you again " stage is over . " It is very common for couples to fall back into the same patterns which they found themselves in the previous time , " says Klow . Hated his habit of turning into a couch-loving sloth on Sundays ? Odds are , you 're going to deal with it again .
