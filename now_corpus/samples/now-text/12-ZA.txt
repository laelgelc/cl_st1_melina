@@703234 <h> British American Tobacco Nigeria <p> Tobacco and responsibility <p> Article 16 January , 2012 - 08:10 <p> British American Tobacco 's Nigerian subsidiary has a near-monopoly , commanding 80 per cent of the market -- but this position has not been achieved without hard work and a positive strategy towards health and economic development . <p> Though British American Tobacco Nigeria ( BATN ) was incorporated as an indigenous entity only 10 years ago in 2002 , we are now coming up to the centenary of the parent company BAT 's presence in Nigeria . So 2012 will be the occasion for a double celebration among the 14,000 or more Nigerians employed , directly or indirectly , through BATN 's activities from leaf growing to distribution . Because BATN does n't just make cigarettes , though manufacturing is a core part of the business . <p> The group runs 45 cigarette factories in 39 countries . Two of these factories are in Nigeria : a state-of-the-art , NIS ISO 9001:2008-accredited plant in Ibadan completed in May 2003 and an older facility at Zaria in Kaduna State which has been operating since 1978 . The Ibadan plant cost $150 million to build and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in new production and packaging machinery . The decision to invest in localised cigarette production and to manufacture in Nigeria international brands that were previously imported from Europe or South Africa -- including Benson and Hedges , St. Moritz , Rothmans , Consulate , London , Pall Mall and Royal Standard -- was taken in 2002 . Today almost all brands -- 22 in all -- sold in West Africa 's ECOWAS markets are manufactured in Nigeria : only Dunhill is imported . <p> The many challenges that face the tobacco industry including image , counterfeiting and competition from unregulated and contraband manufacturers , are manifest in Nigeria . Enormous progress has been made in meeting these challenges , says Sade Morgan , BATN 's legal director . " BAT made a decision to face any problems , not by firefighting but by defining , sharing and promoting best practice in the industry . " This approach is embedded in the business model , whereby the company controls the entire supply chain . BAT is the only international tobacco group with a significant interest in tobacco leaf growing : it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crop production and environmental best practice . <p> A good example is found in BATN 's approach to child labour . Though BAT will not employ children directly , there were indications that under-age labour was present among the 10,000 people directly involved in the tobacco growing operation at Iseyin in Oyo State , where more than 2,000 tonnes of leaf is grown annually . BATN has met this challenge head-on by emphasising the distinction between the traditional attitude that a child should assist its parents and the reality that where work impedes a child 's welfare , safety or educational development , it is considered child labour . The company carries out unscheduled spot checks for child labour on the farms in its supply chain . <p> In 2004 , BATN established a scholarship scheme primarily aimed at the children of tobacco farmers . The scheme provides candidates aged 18 and above with grants to study agriculture or related courses in any Nigerian tertiary education establishment . To date , 76 students have received scholarship grants . " It 's a co-operative model , " says Morgan . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go in for the Best Farmer of the Year awards in which they can win tractors or other machinery . " <p> Nor is best practice is all about addressing abuses , Morgan points out . " We have a good working relationship with the National Office for Technology Acquisition and Promotion ( NOTAP ) , which regulates technology transfer and development throughout the country . " A recent visit to the Ibadan factory by the director-general of NOTAP , Dr Umar Buba Bindir , led to the lauding of BATN 's leaf growing system as a benchmark technology . During 2012 BATN will be extending its growing operations -- and its skills base -- to another state to increase its percentage of home-grown leaf and reduce its dependency on the Global Leaf Pool . <p> In this centenary year , BATN is stepping up its focus on training , Morgan continues . " The technical training programmeis outstanding . We tend to identify students at the Ordinary National Diploma level rather than students with higher degrees , and put them through our nine months of training prior to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a core of employees with the technical skills we require in our operations , right through from marketing to production . " It 's an approach supported by the Nigerian government , which sets a high priority on job creation and indigenous skills development . <p> A major challenge over the last 10 years has been the illegal importation of cigarettes . Tackling this was not easy , says Morgan , but the success of BATN 's strategy of education is shown in the figures . Illicit trade dropped from over 80 per cent in 2001 to around 20 per cent of the total market in 2009 . " In Mali for example , consumers are being educated on the ills of illicit products : if demand dries up , then the traffickers will turn their attention to something else . " It 's largely a problem of perception , she says : consumers must realize that by buying duty-evaded cigarettes they are directly damaging the country , and cutting the revenues that can be spent on things they value , like education and healthcare . The message has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it has had a huge effect , linking cross-border trafficking of cigarettes with the negative associations of people , drugs or arms trafficking . <p> A particularly intransigent problem , Morgan adds , has been to counteract a certain in-built prejudice against locally produced materials : the idea that if a product is imported , it must be better . <p> The absence of any regulatory framework for the tobacco industry in Nigeria threw the onus of defining standards on BATN , and the company has been in the enviable position of leading the development of legislation in consultation with the government . As a result , the appearance of the National Tobacco Control Bill in 2009 presented no problems -- after all , the BAT Group has for many years actively supported the restriction of cigarette advertising to under 18s and a responsible approach to smoking on the part of adults . " It 's actually in our commercial interests to have effective and orderly regulation of the tobacco market , " says Morgan . " As people realise that ' made in Nigeria ' equates to quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also realise that illicit trade harms legitimate business and increases the likelihood of more underage smoking , and cheap unregulated products that can pose a much greater risk to health . " <p> This attitude is complemented by the BATN Foundation , established in 2002 to promote sustainable agricultural development , drinking water , environmental protection , poverty alleviation and skill acquisition . The Foundation has been twice nominated for the Africa Investors Award and has received further awards and recognition for its work in all regions of Nigeria . www.batnigeria.com <p> Now one of BAT Group 's most modern and strategic plants , the Heidelberg factory in South Africa has undergone a remarkable transformation over the last three years .

Until recently , it focused mainly on bilateral relations . The new building suggests a push to foment multilateral links . <p> According to Vines , it is in China 's best business interest to push for stability , especially in the wake of the Arab Spring which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's a recalibration of how China sees Africa . I think the Arab Spring , in particular Libya , was n't anticipated by China , " he told AFP from London . <p> It is also a strategic move on the part of the AU to look outside of Africa and Europe for partnerships . <p> The death of Libyan leader Moamer Kadhafi has meant the loss of major funding for the often short-staffed pan-African bloc . <p> And China 's investment in the AU stretches beyond the construction of the glimmering new AU building . Last December , China pledged $4.5 million to the AU 's mission in Somalia ( AMISOM ) to fight Al-Qaeda-linked Shebab insurgents . <p> China is also a major contributor to United Nations peacekeeping missions in Somalia , Burundi and Sudan according to UK-based civil society group Saferworld . <p> China 's ambassador to Ethiopia and the AU , Xie Xiaoyan , recently said his government 's relationship with the AU serves as a central part of the China-Africa strategic partnership . <p> That partnership was formalized in 2001 with the launch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three years . At the last gathering in 2009 , China pledged $10 billion in loans to Africa . <p> But China views the AU as relatively toothless , according to political science professor at Hong Kong Baptist University Jean-Pierre Cabestan . <p> " China has very good relations with the African Union but ... it knows that the African Union is relatively powerless and finds it difficult to make decisions , " he told AFP in Beijing . <p> Construction of the new headquarters kicked off in January 2009 , and a team of up to 1200 Chinese and Ethiopian workers laboured around the clock in two or three shifts to finish it on schedule . <p> The site boasts three conference centres , a helipad and office space for 700 people .

@@724234 <h> @ Books LIVE <p> Gillian Slovo recently spoke to Lissa Christopher of the Sydney Morning Herald about her newly published book , An Honourable Man , which is set in 19th-century Sudan . An Honourable Man continues the " literary " trajectory of Slovo 's more recent work , which has come to characterise her novels ever since she decided to depart from writing crime fiction . <p> Slovo says that the " safety " of the crime plot was what drove her to the genre in the first place -- but it was this same safety that drove her away : <p> The South African-born author left the safety of crime fiction for the drama of history and found herself in 19th-century Sudan . <p> Gillian Slovo is the author of 13 published novels , a play and a memoir . She is the president of English PEN , she will turn 60 next year and her daughter , Cassie , is well into adulthood . Yet she is still often introduced , first and foremost , as the daughter of famous parents . <p> Their biographies precede hers on the cover sheet attached to the ( unfinalised ) manuscript of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herald . Her Wikipedia entry used to start with " Gillian Slovo is the daughter of " until she altered it and , if you Google her name , the phrase pops up all over the list of hits like a rash . <h> Recent comments : <p> I saw the heading and slumped in a heap . But the points she makes are practical , not about one-up-personship or misplaced snobbery . Writers are flexible . They 're allowed to try new things . Like what she says about the challenge of writing landscape . Now THAT fascinates me , given her exile history and life in a " cold thief place " ( Jean Rhys , I think , on London ) , and the immense complexity of writing landscape in a colonial context . <p> Helen , I think there IS critique there , probably about formal constaints , as GS sees them - ' constraint of plot ' ; ' safety of crime ' ; wanting to ' explore other things , ... feelings . ' etc . On the other hand , the inside/outside dichotomy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very few crime writers keep their characters inside a room , surely ? <p> I 'm still a bit vague as to what ' genre fiction ' is , nor what ' literary fiction ' is . What marks the difference ? There may be some distinction , although I am still unsure that there is , or what it is : and I think the manner in which the two terms are being thrown around may do more damage than anything else ( to put it more forcefully - the two terms are immediately disprovable , it terms of watertight definition ) . <p> Let 's take two very fine novels , Pynchon 's ' Gravity 's Rainbow ' and Mieville 's ' The City and The City ' . I find myself thinking of the former as belonging to some sort of putative postmodern mainstream , but with a lot of usage of tropes and conceits of sf ... while the latter still seems to me to sit within the genre of fantasy - although no one could reject it out of snobbery ; it 's just so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do , it terms of writing skill . <p> Ja , but it does matter re the cultural capital that comes to surround one 's work . <p> I du n no if this is an analogous situation emerging here , but when I was deep into sf in the 1960s/970s I used to find mainstream imitations of what the sf writers were doing pretty flou ( Damien Walter 's list is a bit of a disappointment , though it 's nice to see someone give ' Lanark ' a bit of a plump ) - in terms of the lengths sf writers were prepared to go to follow an extrapolation , and the risks they were prepared to take .... that critic who said Philip K Dick 's novels ' make most of the European avant-garde seem navel-gazers in a cul-de-sac ' had a point , I think . At the same time , Dick was looked down on as an inferior just because he was marketed within a ' genre ' . It 's only very recently people outside of sf realised his importance . <p> Agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Do note the absence of Murakami . ) And it feels a bit like Winterson and Dunmore are off on cowboy camp for a week , just for a lark - I do n't imagine their input will invigorate anyone as much as someone like Mieville , who 's deadly serious about what he writes , does . <p> The mainstream people can also be a bit gutless with their use of ' genre ' ideas and tropes , Louis - I remember being told with excitement by an academic friend about one of Ishiguro 's novels - the one on cloning - which , when read , felt a bit tame vis-a-vis what 's available in the ' genre ' of sf . <p> Come to think of it , I guess there 's also snobs both sides of the divide - my fave example is the 1973 Nebulas , when Arthur Clarke 's ' Rendezvous with Rama ' beat out ' Gravity 's Rainbow ' for the prize ! I guess it 's a question of not being blinkered , whichever way one looks .... <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projections on this . There 's also an assumption that once one goes digital , one does everything digitally without recourse to ' marginal ' forms . It flattens out the possibility that people may choose to move between different modes of receiving information and knowledge .

@@728231 <p> Let 's not forget , friends , that we are witnessing history unfold here today . We are gathered here to consolidate our strength and chart a way forward , not only for the party but for our province . <p> The gains we have made are significant . We have established coalition governments in four councils . In 2011 we virtually doubled our vote in the province with signs of growth in support across all districts . <p> We are an ambitious party . But this is not the ambition built solely on self-interest and narrow obsession with power . It 's an ambition based on our prospects off leading government in the Northern Cape and delivering for its people . <p> On our guiding principles <p> Every step of the way we will be guided by the four pillars on which all our actions and policies are based . <p> The first of these pillars is REDRESS . This means that we are committed to reversing the legacy of Apartheid . Poverty and unequal education does not need to be the destiny of so many people in the Northern Cape . <p> Reflecting back a few years ago , this province @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 2003 , the Northern Cape pitched the highest nationally , achieving a 90,7% pass rate - the best in the country . Last year we pitched a mediocre 68,8% . What went wrong ? Well colleagues , we know exactly where the problem lies . Cadre deployment is the cancer that stole opportunities from our children . <p> We are a party that delivers where we govern . A DA government would work tirelessly to ensure that children from the green Kalahari to the hills of rural Namakwaland are given the opportunity to develop to their full potential . <p> And we are proving already , where we govern , that we can do this . In just two years , the matric pass rate in the Western Cape has improved year-on-year to become the best in the country . And we are just getting started there . Given the chance to govern , we can do the same for children in the Northern Cape . <p> What we have come to learn is that good governance has the greatest impact on the lives of the working class and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now home to the most celebrated public transport system in the country - the MyCiti Bus . <p> Every day , tens of thousands of citizens make use of its services to move between work and home safely and affordably . And this same approach to public transport can be applied to towns , cities and rural areas of the Northern Cape . <p> Imagine a system that would allow people to move safely and cheaply between the towns and villages of Namakwaland ; or from surrounding villages and residential areas to the centres of cities like Kimberley and Upington ; or from the rural plains of John Taole Gaetsewe to urban centres for work and school ? <p> REDRESS is about creating a more equitable and just society for all citizens . It is about doing something about the past neglect that affected the poor and working class so acutely . <p> The only way to achieve REDRESS is through the second pillar : DELIVERY . Our governments , whether at local or provincial level , are the cleanest and most efficient in the country . <p> Consistently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sector research has shown that DA governments in Gauteng , the Eastern Cape and the Western Cape are the best governed in the country . We look forward to our governments in the Northern Cape joining the ranks of the best . <p> Under the stewardship of the DA , Cape Town is growing into a world-class city with world-class infrastructure . <p> The city is now the Design Capital of the World ; the home to one of the seven natural wonders of the world ; and as early as 2008 it was acknowledged as having the best mayor in the world in the form of Helen Zille . Patricia De Lille is continuing that proud legacy and we wish her the best going forward . <p> The tourism industry is now performing better than at any other time in history and contributing to the creation of thousands of jobs . <p> Through an innovative partnership with the private sector , we have created a safe and secure environment in the centre of the city that competes with only the best cosmopolitan cities of the world . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this . Imagine what we could do for cities like Kimberley and Upington ; or for towns like Kuruman , De Aar and Calvinia ? <p> Through meaningful partnerships with the private sector , whether it be commercial farmers or urban businesses , we can make life better for the residents of the Northern Cape . ( KE NAKO ! ! ) <p> The concept of partnerships brings us to the third pillar : RECONCILIATION . We come from a deeply divided and horrible past that has left so many people indelibly scarred . <p> The only way to move forward toward a shared future is to acknowledge the wrongs of the past and to find meaningful ways for people to build partnerships that will result in a better future for our children . <p> There is no reason why the interests of commercial farmers and farmworkers can not be reconciled or the interests of middle and working class Kimberley . <p> At the end of the day there are basic things that we all want for ourselves and our children : jobs and a flourishing economy ; a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a safe environment in which to live and work . <p> There is immense potential for new and positive ways of seeing each other and working together . But to realize this we must oppose the racial nationalism and populist rhetoric that has become so common in our politics today . <p> We must reject the views of politicians who for selfish reasons play on the prejudices and insecurities of groups of people . The politics of race , language and gender should have died when Nelson Mandela assumed office in 1994 . <p> Today , the DA is the only party that is still guided by the non-racial dream of Mandela . We have become the standard-bearer of a new generation of people , many of them of young and idealistic . <p> Many of those in power today have abandoned the nation-building project . The road they are taking this country down is a dangerous one . The time is fast-approaching where those value the dream of 1994 need to find each other very quickly for the sake of our country . <p> The final pillar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is DIVERSITY . Friends , you only have to look around the room today to see that the DA is blossoming into the most diverse political party this country has ever seen . <p> Diversity can be described in thousands of ways : from race to gender to religion to background to political views . Protecting and promoting diversity in our country is an imperative that we can not take lightly . <p> Promoting diversity is about protecting the rights of individuals . The collectivist politics of other parties in our country only serve to drive people back into their respective groups . <p> What our politicians do n't realize is that are multiple ways of being a South African and , indeed , of being African . We must ensure that we continue to be a party that not only respects this diversity , but also celebrates it . <p> Way Forward : <p> The strides we have made so far as a collective is a clear indication that we are on the right path . To enable us to get to our destination , which is to win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> Where we govern , we in coalition need to do that beyond reproach . <p> Employ not deploy competent and skilled people . <p> Manifesting the " open opportunity " society for all . <p> By 2014 , we will unite in our focus of leading a coalition government in the Northern Cape . <p> By 2016 we are intent on leading governments in three of the five districts : Namakwa , PixleykaSeme and Siyanda . We will also govern in the city of Upington . <p> By 2019 , we plan to build on that majority in a year when the DA will form the core of a new national government . <p> Today we affirm our path toward each of these milestones . We lay down our commitment to building a new majority in the Northern Cape . <p> As part of our collective responsibility we will continue to search for new talent to enhance our objectives for 2014 : " Building a new majority " . <p> These constituencies will be clustered to streamline the operations and political activities that need to take place at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a cluster which will consist of three constituencies ( 3 ) . These clusters will be subdivided into geographic and functional classifications . Vice chairpersons will be allocated with portfolios i.e ) administration , strategic thinking and finance . All these will be done in collaboration with the constituency chairpersons , constituency heads , provincial director , provincial chair and provincial leader . This method of working will be guided by teamwork and consultation . <p> In conclusion : <p> Friends , let me leave you with a thought : <p> Each one of us should realise that as we walk away here today , we leave something behind . What we leave depends entirely on us.

@@728233 <h> Related News <p> I feel like a non-French speaker stumbling into a conference of snobs . The reason for this rests primarily with a game called The Elder Scrolls V : Skyrim . Everyone , from Lazygamer 's own Garth Holden to my non-existent children , had been waiting for and then , upon procuring , has loved this game . Big words and loaded descriptions , pumped full of the hot air of gamers ' expectations , took up unnecessary focus in the gaming landscape , like a fat man sitting in front of you at a movie theatre . It looks beautiful ; it looks exciting . But , after playing it for some hours , I 'm utterly unconvinced that Bethesda has improved on their consistent mistakes . <p> Similarly , I 'm also convinced they 've pulled off the biggest middle finger to gamers in recent history . <p> This is not surprising to anyone who has spent considerable time on Bethesda 's previous stupid titles , like Fallout 3 and The Elder Scrolls IV : Oblivion . Here are some things Bethesda still does n't get right . <p> Human People Faces and Bodies <p> The first sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encountering a strange amalgam of pixels , which speaks in ( usually ) a British accent and calls itself a person , you react with : " Argh ! " What are you ! Kill it with fire ! " * Whoever makes **29;699;TOOLONG models for Bethesda has n't seen a human person since he or she was breastfed . Or perhaps this is how humans look to those who kidnap and tie people up in cling-wrap . <p> You 'll notice these characters do n't actually have expressions and/or their mouths move but their eyes , eyebrows tend to remain static . The fact it is unnerving we can handle ; it 's that the game is trying to be realistic that makes this laughable . <p> And that 's not good . I do n't want to laugh . I want to be as engaged with the characters as I am with the beautiful environment , weather and fluidity of clouds and sky and rain . The natural world is one of the most immersive environments since Myst . The sound is brilliant and the textures and landscapes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awe , wonder and the sensation that you really are there . Drops of water echo throughout cave-systems ; grass sways to the thuds of giants ' steps ; clouds swirl and mists quiver at one 's feet . Mountain tops really are misty <p> But then a mannequin , which Bethesda calls a person , comes fumbling through like a one legged ostrich and squawks at you about some missing sword or gem or child . As it does so , its weird stupid features make you wonder which species this is meant to be . This breaks the immersion and all the beauty they worked so hard to create is sucked away into this ugly vacuum called a character model . <p> This has been a consistent problem since forever for these developers . Just go through the scary montage of faces for Oblivion and Fallout . It 's quite disgusting -- actually , disturbing ( see Cling wrap Psychopath thesis ) -- that anyone thought these were passable human faces . <p> Movement <p> I ca n't take a game seriously that deals out this amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Models move as if they 're constantly on flat land , with legs barely recognising height differentiation . This might sound petty , but I assure you it 's not . See , when your character does n't react to the land he 's standing on , it 's like the game is pointing a fat finger at the model and saying " LOOK ! IT 'S A GAME ! YOU 'RE NOT REALLY THERE , NERD ! YOU 'RE JUST IN THIS VERY UGLY DUDE 'S BODY ! " <p> Not reacting to the land is not reacting to the environment . It throws you out of the experience . Now , obviously you can play Skyrim in 1st-person , but the problem persists for all models . So you might be fighting alongside or amidst a coterie , but you just ca n't take any of it seriously when they 're all moonwalking forwards toward your foes . <p> This too has been a stupid problem , like the previous . Players have expressed how much they enjoy playing in 3rd-person but who wants to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the environment ? Who wants to play a game where models barely acknowledge the sloped mountain they 're killing dragons on ? And , seriously , fix your stupid " horses " ( or , as I call them , steroid moose ) . <p> Bugs <p> Yeah , screw you , Bethesda . I 'm both intrigued and angered by the common reply of " Oh well , it is Bethesda . You should expect it to be buggy . " I expect humans to do stupid things all the time ; I expect us to make laws banning research into areas that promise the most in terms of medical science ; I expect humans to literally kill each other over what happens in games . I also expect every game to not work on my PC and on my PS3 , since no game is perfect <p> But there 's a difference between expecting and accepting . See , what people are saying when they claim we should " expect " Bethesda games to be buggy is that we should just " accept " it . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we pay full-price for ? Since when , as consumers , did we stop saying " I 'm giving you all of this money for the entire package , as you claim it to be " ? It is unacceptable that Bethesda consistently releases DVD-shaped poop and hope you do n't notice the smell . <p> This , like the character models , has still not been improved on . <p> Variation <p> Grey , dull , lifeless . No , I 'm not describing Mitt Romney but the textures and colour variations used in Bethesda 's games , from Oblivion to Fallout 3 ( especially Fallout 3 ) . They 've actually improved a lot in Skyrim , so this is a less critical point . However , this is about variation which Bethesda uses up on their brilliance of sound textures , music , and , mostly , landscape details . <p> Towns look similar . Character models look and sound similar . Speech and dialogue lines from NPCs are all the same , even so far as using the same voice actor ( despite an impressive number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : merchants talking about how great their wares are , herbalists wanting to pull the quackery we see in today 's world by diagnosing you with ailments that do n't exist ( detox anyone ? ) . Towns are too similar in design and structure . And , of course , the old carrot of clich ? d plotlines which I 've beaten you with my own stick before .. <p> It 's a big map ( understatement ) . But , as all the women I sleep with know , bigger is not necessarily better . Yet , as with many sandbox games , we are deceived into thinking a stupid fetch quest is " epic " , when in fact it just took so damn long to get there . <p> An example of a game that minimises distance , somewhat , but gives you immersive and truly epic quests is Deus Ex : Human Revolution ( probably the best game to come out recently , in my opinion ) . For example , I was told to get money back from a woman who had n't been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through and discover there 's another side to the story : she claims to being extorted . Now you have two or three choices in how to proceed . Kill her , intimidate her , go on her side , confront bar , etc . It 's a simple quest , but the complexity that arises out of it is not only unexpected but treats you like a moral adult . Fetching a sword from the other side of the world so you can have some sexy time with it is hardly worth 3 hours of my life . <p> Combat <p> Skyrim has the same combat mechanism as that other overrated , repetitive nonsense Diablo : click-click-click x 1,000 . At least Diablo has many other things going for it , like being fun and having a bitching storyline and mythology . In Skyrim , swords , like characters ' feet , do n't really interact with what they come into contact with . You just kind of hack in someone 's general direction until they fall down . We 're not expecting the brilliance of Condemned 's melee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even a little to say something about the meeting of two objects in the world : say a sword and some flesh . Instead , characters just seem to fall down after awhile and react like empty bags of skin to the ground . <p> Also , characters are terrible at blocking and the slo-mo super death thing just does n't look that great ( Dragon Age : Origins probably has some of the best I 've ever seen ) . <p> Combat is a nasty affair in Skyrim , as it was in Fallout and Oblivion , and not in the way the developers intended . <p> Story <p> Ah , my old favourite criticism point . It seems that few companies know how to make a good story . F3AR , for example , is different because they got not one , but two , great horror writers to produce their story : John Carpenter ( The Thing ) and Steven Niles ( 30 Days of Night , original comic series and later cool movie ) . I 'm not sure who wrote or did the plotting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mostly meaningless and is not very exciting . <p> And , as game writer Nicole Tanner highlights , even if you enjoyed the main quest , there 's little reward or acknowledgement that you 've done anything so grand as complete the main quest in Skyrim itself . Life continues as if nothing really happened . Real life should continue as if you 've done nothing but sit on your arse for hours , but the least the digital world could do something : a castle ? A book ? Groupies ? <p> The game essentially says : " So what if you saved the world ? You still need to pay rent , take the trash out and walk the dog , big man . " Yeah , well , most of us get that regardless of whether we 've saved a gaming world . The point of a gaming world is to obtain some kind of grand reward to match up to the grand conflict we resolved .

We 're creatures spurned on by incentives : otherwise , why the hell should we do anything you say , Max von Sydow ? <p> Praises , Solutions and Conclusion <p> I 've already highlighted what Skyrim gets right : some beautiful graphics , immersion , sound and the ability to suck you in ( as long as there 's no moving character models ) . I 'm greatly impressed they 've increased their voice-actors to number more than three ( despite it feeling like they 're only three , but I 've pointed out the problem with variation above ) . <p> And their implementation of dual-wielding is fantastic , despite my reservations of the combat . That one can wield magic , while swinging a sword , is brilliant , as well as doubling the power of the spell if its dual-wielded . Now we just need to actually " feel " like the blade is penetrating flesh . <p> Though the skills tree is quite silly to use ( just try getting to a specific spot on the PS3 ) , it does look elegant and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Witcher 2 did a better job and a mixture of the both games would probably be better . <p> Character models still look and act really stupid . It 's bizarre to me that today we 're still having this problem ; it 's more bizarre when you think of what Bethesda achieves in every area except their character models : whose faces look like Satan 's estranged haemorrhoids and who consistently ignore the laws of physics . You can make our hearts fill with wonder with golden dawns , rain on long grass , shadowed caves , and creaking trees , but you ca n't make Farmer Joe look like he 's walking properly back home to sleep with his wife-daughter-sister ( same person ) ? For shame . <p> And the story ? Really ? I 'm not an accomplished story-teller , though I 've written some fiction in my life that people have appreciated , so I kind of know how to create , and what constitutes competent stories . Stop hiring people who either do n't know or ca n't help you execute your games . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool but its not entirely original or that exciting . If you 're going to use dragons , why make them one dimensional ? Why ca n't we ride one or be friends with one ?

@@728236 <h> Water Corporation : SSDP expansion <p> Planning ahead <p> Article 30 January , 2012 - 08:50 <p> Western Australia 's Water Corporation has commenced the expansion of its second major water desalination plant to end dependency on climate sensitive rainfall . Project director Nick Churchill updates Gay Sutton about project managing for a speedy and cost-effective outcome . <p> Western Australia is one of the world 's driest places and it 's indisputably getting drier . During the 1970s the state 's water supply was fed mainly from rain runoff collected and stored in a network of dams in addition to a small amount from underground aquifers . At that time , the average annual rain runoff into the dams amounted to around 320 gigalitres ( GL ) and was more than sufficient for the state 's needs . But by 2001 , runoff had decreased to just 70 GL a year -- in other words , the water resource had shrunk to just 20 per cent of its 1970s level . <p> To provide security of water supply to this vast and arid region , the state 's water provider , the Water Corporation , has been restructuring its operations and installing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly for the south-western region around Perth where the recent decline in rainfall has been the most dramatic . Today , only one third of water needs is supplied from the dams : the remainder is supplied by underground aquifers and two seawater desalination plants . <p> The Water Corporation 's Perth Seawater Desalination Plant was the first large-scale project of this nature in Australia , and has been producing 50 GL of water a year continuously since coming online in 2007 . A second similar project quickly followed and the Southern Seawater Desalination Plant ( SSDP ) came into operation in September 2011 . Work is now underway to expand the plant , doubling its output . <p> " Expansion was already foreseen when we began planning the first phase of SSDP , " explains project director Nick Churchill . " So we completed all relevant assessments and approvals for a second plant at the time we did the first , a process that has now saved us two years . " <p> Two master plans were also created at the early planning stage of phase I. The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plan for a possible second phase . " When we undertook the risk assessment , we also looked carefully at the plan for the expanded site . Where there was a risk that work for phase II could involve shutting down the existing plant or that it would be cheaper to install phase II infrastructure during phase I , then we did the work right away . " <p> The major water intake pipes connecting the plant to the pumping station and the highly sensitive and complex marine work into the ocean are an example of this . All the tunnelling and engineering for both phases were completed during phase I , leaving just the installation of additional pumping equipment and the infrastructure for connecting the pipe work to the new plant to be completed in phase II . <p> The construction and engineering work that has just been initiated will have a lot to live up to . Phase I earned the team a number of prestigious industry awards including two Australian Institute of Project Management Awards , Project of the Year at the International Tunnelling Awards and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feat as industry and business in Western Australia is heavily engineering-oriented . <p> Moreover , phase I was delivered three months ahead of schedule and slightly under budget , an achievement that Churchill attributes to the knowledge and experience gained on the construction of the Perth plant . " One of the most effective things we did at that time was to bring together everyone from the first desalination project and engage in a huge brain dump session looking at all the risks , what worked well and what did not . Then we were able to tackle all these issues early for SSDP . " This focus on continuous improvement has resulted in a considerable bank of expertise among the Water Corporation team , knowledge that they are happy to share with others in the industry . <p> Many of the lessons learned during phase I are now being applied and developed in the second phase . The contracting strategy , for example , is being honed to improve efficiency and effectiveness . " With multiple contractors on Phase I it took a lot of time to manage the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanical and electrical installations as their work is so closely interdependent . On phase II we 'll be going for two major contractors -- AJ Lucas for the civils package and the mechanical &amp; electrical contractor is yet to be announced . " <p> Desalination technology has also moved forward significantly , and one of the major innovations being incorporated into phase II is a microfiltration seawater pre-treatment process which will pre-treat the water for both plants . Another innovation , which at this stage is exclusively for the new plant , is the use of a hybrid reverse osmosis membrane which operates at a lower pressure and is therefore more energy efficient . <p> The Southern Seawater Desalination projects , of course , have not been without their challenges . Perhaps the most curious occurred when construction began on the water storage tank overlooking the site . " It turned out that this was the location for a World War II bombing range , and we found a number of unexploded ordnance in the ground , " he says . " We had to shut the work down for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to clear the entire site and make it safe . " <p> A more difficult challenge came when the decision to go ahead with the project was announced by the Premier , and the local communities had not been prepared for it . " At the time we were progressing a major ground water source , " Churchill recalls . " The new desalination plant was the alternative water source strategy , which made the announcement a shock for the local community . " <p> The reaction among local communities was angry and vocal , and action groups were formed against the project . " The critical part for us was that the approval process incorporated public comment . So we had to engage with these communities and spent a lot of effort making the process as transparent as possible , providing information and enabling the community to comment on it . " <p> Long-term noise and the visual appearance of the site were two of the major concerns , and from an early stage the plans were adapted to incorporate a berm -- an eight-metre high embankment to reduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , particularly as this was a fishing and holiday area , was that the beach might be closed for a three-year period while the marine works were undertaken linking the plant with the sea . <p> " That certainly raised a lot of angst , " Churchill says . " But by choosing tunnelling methods we only closed the beach for a week , as a safety precaution , each time we tunnelled beneath . In the end , by meeting our commitments and following through on what we said we 'd do , we 've turned the situation around in a spectacular way . The community is now completely supportive of the project . " <p> Construction of phase II began in September 2011 immediately after the announcement had been made . And if all goes according to plan , the new plant will be commissioned and put into operation at the end of 2012 . " Phase II will be variable flow , " Churchill says . " The output will depend on the volume of rainfall and surface water available . So when the dams are full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This will make us independent of rainfall . " Such security of supply will certainly be appreciated in the dry and arid region . <h> Content you might like <p> Western Australia is a dry state and getting drier by the year : its dams and groundwater can no longer be expected to supply the increasing population of its fast-growing capital , Perth , so the Water Corporation is turning to other climate independent sources . <p> Dampier Port Authority is on the threshold of a major expansion programme .

Grease and dirt is not only unsightly , it can harbour all manner of unpleasant micro-organisms and easily lead to litigation , especially in food handling industries . <p> Blendwell Chemicals has a simple message : whatever the operating environment , the Blendwell way is the cleanest way . Supporting higher standards of cleanliness has been core to its operations since the company began trading 21 years ago as an industrial cleaning chemical manufacturer .

@@734232 <h> Rangie Evoque is a superb machine <p> . The Evoque is a superb machine with extraordinary versatility but not cheap at R606 000 . <p> It 's quite clear that Jaguar and Land Rover personnel are revelling in new freedom afforded since the Indian Tata Group bought the brands just over three years ago . <p> Where previously the reins were steered by tight Ford execs who cut here and skimped there , now control 's been given back to those passionate about restoring the luxurious marques ' former glory , and the cars are benefitting . <p> New models are of better quality , performance is on the up and , as it should be , style is again oozing from aluminium roof panels down to where rubber meets road . <p> HONOURS ALL ' ROUND <p> The renaissance has been well received . In 2010 we voted the new Jaguar XJ this publication 's Car of the Year , and late last year we announced this car , Range Rover 's new Evoque , our favourite vehicle of 2011 . And we were n't the only ones . Sniff around the net and you 'll see this little SUV 's scooping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Style-wise the Evoque looks like a four-year-old concept vehicle called the LRX that impressed public at motor shows around the globe , but underneath it 's loosely based on Land Rover 's Freelander 2 . In five door trim like our test unit ( it also comes in a two-door coup ? ) dimensions are similar to the Freelander too , except for a lower roofline , ride height and sleek angles that make it seem much smaller . Just a little bigger than your average four-door hatch actually . <p> Sleek looks disguise the fact that Evoque is based on the Freelander 2 .. <p> On the road the Evoque feels nothing like its Freelander sibling . It feels lighter on its feet because it is , with lots of new aluminium and magnesium suspension parts , and the track 's also been widened to keep it better planted when leaned on in asphalt esses . <p> Unlike the Freelander , the Evoque also gets a new electric power-steering system that always feels light in your hands , and while some might say it 's a little over-assisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steering 's directness is a rack that 's mounted directly to the front subframe without rubber bushes . The design works well , with every little input translating to direction changes , and no dreaded numbness or self-centering issues normally associated with electric steering . <p> EXCESSIVE ROAD NOISE <p> But to nitpick , I do think the lack of rubber mountings , together with other weight-saving measures , contributes to slightly excessive road noise that you wo n't find in other Rangies , or even a Freelander for that matter . <p> It 's obvious by looking at it , that the Evoque 's first priority is on-road performance , but looks can be deceiving . Fact is , it 's as nimble as many a hot hatch on tar , but the baby Range Rover can hold its own offroad as well . <p> Seats are brilliantly comfortable and one of the car 's most impressive features .. <p> It 's a full-time four-wheel drive system ( there 's also a front-wheel drive only version overseas ) that 'll take even the biggest offroading buffoons pretty far into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But additional traction-enhancing gizmos like hill start , hill descent , and Land Rover 's signature Terrain Response ( here it 's pushbuttons instead of the usual turny knob ) allows drivers to choose preset traction settings for Gravel , Snow , Sand , etc that will take you most places you want to go . <p> The Evoque has shorter overhangs than the Freelander but we still scraped the front bumper on some approaches . <p> Regardless of its on and offroad performance , the Evoque 's best feature , and probably what swayed it most into Motoring 's Car of the Year spot , is its interior . Straight away you 're greeted by a set of the coolest , sculpted seats we 've seen this side of a supercar . They 're as pleasing just to look at as to sit in , and over a long distance test drive from Jozi to Plett and back , held me in all the right places . Very cozy . <p> I could , however , criticise the rear seats , which are positioned higher so that rear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hard for the driver to see past them in the mirror . The nature of the sexy side window lines also create a small blind-spot issue . <p> There 's lots of Jaguar tech creeping in ; most of all in the motorised gear-selector gizmo that rises up from its flush mount in the console when the engine 's started . <p> The overhead lights are also touch-sensitive just like Jag 's , there 's a mood lighting feature , and the touch-screen media interface is also familiar from the sister brand . I do wish though , that some of the steps through nav , radio and phone connection settings could be simplified . There are one or two too many presses to get things done . <p> Our test car was a 2-litre turbo petrol version with 177kW and 340Nm , that hums along smoothly and dishes up decent punch when needed . The six-speed auto box is snappy enough , and there are steering paddles , but I hardly used them . The Evoque 's natural shift points happened intuitively enough without them , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Si4 did a best 0-100km/h dash in 8.9 seconds and the quarter mile in 16.6 . Average fuel consumption was just over 10l/100km . <p> VERDICT <p> Okay , so the Range Rover badges are just nameplay , given the Freelander roots , but the Evoque still pulls off Rangey luxuriousness nicely . <p> A unique cross between luxury , sport and 21st century gizmo-gadgetry actually . It 's not cheap with a starting price of R583 000 ( this one 's R606 000 ) but it 's the cheapest Range Rover by a long shot . And well worth it . -Drive Times <h> Comment Guidelines <p> Has a comment offended you ? Hover your mouse over the comment and wait until a small triangle appears on the right-hand side .

@@746236 <h> Voice players to feel margin squeeze <p> Companies that provide voice-over-Internet Protocol ( VoIP ) telephony services are going to come under significant margin pressure after March and this could lead to a wave of consolidation in the sector , with some smaller players being driven out of business . <p> This is the bleak view of Ryan Miles , chief operating officer at office automation company Itec , who says the explosion in the number of new players in recent years in the VoIP market is not sustainable as call termination rates come down . <p> Miles says the reduction in the rates -- they 're being brought down by the regulator , the Independent Communications Authority of SA ( Icasa ) , over a three-year glide path between 2011 and 2013 -- will hit smaller players the hardest . <p> On 1 March , the peak-time mobile call termination rate -- what the mobile operators charge to carry calls onto their networks -- will be cut from 73c/minute to 56c/minute . Next year , they 'll fall again , to 40c/minute . It 's possible Icasa will force further reductions in 2014 and beyond . <p> The reductions have already hammered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards , steering calls along the cheapest routes -- because the arbitrage opportunities they took advantage of when the rates were higher have largely gone away . The pressure is now also being felt by VoIP players , Miles says , with revenues and profit margins both falling . <p> He believes this year 's cut in termination rates will tip a lot of the smaller VoIP operators over the edge , forcing them to merge , be acquired , or risk going out of business . Miles says Itec is also one of the smaller players in the game and is considering its strategic options . " We are doing volumes significant enough that it does make sense but are cautiously monitoring our investment in this space . " <p> Because the VoIP market is highly competitive , companies have been forced to match the reductions in termination rates . " It 's become cut-throat , " he says . <p> Gross margins could soon fall into single digits . He adds that companies not selling at least 15m minutes a month of voice traffic wo n't be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's not easy to attain for any start-up business . " <p> Barriers to entry have risen enormously , whereas a few years ago they were " relatively low " . <p> " A lot of the tier two and tier three VoIP operators are now battling to break even . These guys will have to consolidate , " Miles says . " Either that , or they have to expand into another product set , like data services . But the same thing is happening with data charges . " <p> In addition , changing focus and reinventing their businesses is not something many companies are capable of . <p> He warns companies that use VoIP providers should not lock themselves into long-term agreements -- including with Itec -- given the turmoil that he expects in the next few years . Many companies buy their voice and data services from a single supplier but this is risky , he says . " Your business could come to a standstill if those things become dysfunctional in any way .

@@746237 <h> Cape cops ' R12bn drug haul <p> Western Cape police have seized drugs valued at almost R12 billion since April 2010 , but it 's just the tip of the iceberg . <p> This was the sombre revelation by Western Cape police commissioner Arno Lamoer during briefings by all provincial commissioners on crime statistics at Parliament on Wednesday . <p> Lamoer told the police committee the drugs trade was contributing hugely to crime figures and that the Western Cape was seen as the province that used drugs the most . <p> " Addicts steal to feed their habit . The province is also a huge destination for people . Eight million came through the airport between January and December last year . <p> " Every single day we confiscate drugs , " he said , adding that drugs worth more than R50m had been confiscated from buses in one week in January when drug routes into the province were blocked . <p> " The violent crime and the gangsterism in the Western Cape are all linked to one thing -- drugs . If we can stop the drugs , crime will come down radically , and people will be safe . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Looking at that R12bn just shows you that there 's an awful lot of drugs available .

" <p> He said the drug trade considered Cape Town " a very lucrative place to do business " . <p> The wide range of anti-drug measures needed constant hard work and vigilance , he said . <p> " We need to continue to hit the drug cartels very hard . We can do much , much better . But we 've had a recent glimpse into the underworld and at least we know they are now scared .

" <p> The prevalent drug was tik , but heroin use was rising . This was mixed with dagga to form " unga " . <p> Myers said drug abuse in the Western Cape " cuts across all communities , all demographics " . <p> The committee also heard from a number of provincial commissioners that the ever-increasing influx of foreigners into SA and the resulting increase in informal settlement populations were contributing greatly to the country 's crime rate . <p> The mushrooming of informal businesses -- many opened by foreigners -- and an absence of municipal by-laws to regulate them were problems cited by most provinces in tackling crime . <p> The Western Cape recorded a 1.6 percent increase in murders , from 2 274 between April 2009 and March 2010 , to 2 311 between April 2010 and March last year . <p> For the same period , attempted murders rose by 26.7 percent , from 1 707 to 2 162 . <p> Sexual offences dropped by 3.9 percent , from 9 678 to 9 299 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and carjacking by 20.5 percent , while truck-jacking rose by 21.7 percent .

Hence the loud emphasis on ' busts'and arrests , and mere whisperings on the abysmal conviction rates . Some of the politicos are either clueless , or are opportunists playing to the gallery they all have ' zero tolerance ' for crime , and ' take no prisoners ' and ' show no mercy ' in there uninformed public statements . The Murder and Robbery rates are shocking ! However , the dumbing down of SAPS through re-militarisation and Rambofication is a perverse and obtuse response .

It is all but inevitable that they will indeed be legalised but probably only afte a lot more pain and bloodshed . <p> The reason for the drug problem in South Africa .

These labs have massive massive backlogs ( incompetencelazinessnot enough lab technicians due to AA , etc ) And a lot of these cases eventually gets thrown out of court for lack of evidence and long delays . THIS is why the problem never ends and as long as zuma and his justice minister buddies salaries remain unaffected this will continue . People need to rise up and sort out these drug dens themselves as the justice system is simply useless .

GREG NICOLSON joined the crowds of men watching the miniskirt march and wondered about their role in preventing abuse . <p> The weekend started early on Friday as I filled a cooler box and headed to the miniskirt march in town . It was an assignment any young , male reporter would welcome . Usually the legs do n't come out en masse until at least Friday evening , which is often matched by a queue , a rope barrier and a bouncer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " So at 14.00 , I was on the way to a sundowner with some of Jozi 's finest , in some of Jozi 's skimpiest , without having to pay an entrance fee .

It 's good to keep these mini-skirt gatherings down the road from the courts , just in case someone dares to arrive in a knee-length number or , dare I say it , a maxi dress , I thought . I rolled up to the rank with my eyes peeled and camera handy . But there was no mass gathering of miniskirts . As soon as I arrived , the rain put a dampener on the excitement as commuters and hawkers sprinted for shelter . Braving the downpour , journalists explored the circumference of the taxi rank , a multi-level brick building , effectively a car park framed by stalls and drowned in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bundling bags to the right bay , students on the way home and taxi drivers shepherding passengers into their vans , but no short skirts . <p> " Eureka ! " I thought when I finally saw two young women , displaying considerable amounts of leg , crossing the road towards the commuter hub . Two women was hardly a gathering , but a lead worth watching . They turned the corner into the taxi rank and were jeered by two of the five men leaning against a concrete wall . I could n't make out the exchange , but it was clear the advances were unwanted . One man stepped out and tried to grab hold of the second woman 's wrist . She yanked it away and the men yelled after them . The men rested on their wall while the women hurried off , ignoring the stream of comments . <p> Like everyone else , I watched and feigned disinterest .

They had different relationships with their tormentors , who included family members , teachers , schoolmates , partners and strangers . But in each case the perpetrators had branded the women with a traumatic memory , often hidden like a secret tattoo . They were harassed , held , groped , molested and raped . <p> A text message told me the miniskirt march was already at the Noord taxi rank and I scuffled through the CBD so as not to miss it .

Holding her hand was one of the young women harassed at Noord taxi rank in December . <p> As the group entered Pritchard Street , the woman , in a denim miniskirt , blue t-shirt and pink scarf , left the premier 's side to join other young women to dance in front of the crowd . To cheers from the marchers and in front of a large crowd of interested onlookers , they held their chests while dancing for the cameras . While the protesters were almost all women , many men turned out to watch them pass . A few joked about the march 's concept . We should congratulate the ruling party for perfecting the political mini-skirt , I laughed to myself .

" Xingwana condemned gender based violence and threatened to close the Noord taxi rank if harassment continued . " Real men do n't rape women . Real men love and respect women , " she said . Basic education minister and ANCWL president Angie Motshekga , in a sky blue dress suit rather than miniskirt , said women have the right to dress how they choose .

Picture : Leon Lestrade <p> Prominent underworld crime bosses are controlling the flow of drugs into Cape Town communities , according to Western Cape premier Helen Zille , who has revealed that high-level efforts to engage local gang bosses are aimed at " catching the big fish " . <p> Zille was speaking in an interview yesterday , following her state of the province address on Frida. , Zille 's comments come after Weekend Argus revelations about the lucrative bouncer trade at Peninsula nightclubs , which was followed by several arrests and the effective shutdown of illegal operator Specialised <p> Protection Services ( SPS ) . <p> The premier said she was keeping close tabs on efforts to bring the city 's suspected gang and underworld bosses to their knees . While she was cautious of Community Safety MEC Dan Plato 's approach - holding talks with suspected gang and underworld bosses - the ultimate goal was to net the main culprits . <p> " There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted . <p> " I 've discussed it with MEC Plato and he is trying to engage everyone in constructive discussions to try to bring an end to gang violence . <p> " His strategy has been criticised , and I do believe it is a very fine line to walk , because when people are making big money out of gangsterism and drugs trafficking , a little bit of persuasion is unlikely to turn them . " <p> But the strategy could also be seen as part of a bigger plan . <p> " It 's no use putting the tiny little one-tablet seller in jail , and the big bosses are out there .

Possibly , even greater . <p> Remembering DOS <p> Personally , Windows 8 CP marks an evolution in Microsoft 's OS . Gone is the desktop ( well not gone , but hidden ) and gone is fumbling around for files . Everything is within easy reach , proven by the search function is built into the meat of the UI . Windows 7 had a neat search bar which ran from the Start menu . Windows 8 tosses that crap out the window and lets users search from anywhere . Just start typing and Windows 8 delivers search results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artefacts of the past . <p> I have to digress . Why change the look of a UI that is 30 years in the making ? Because we have to grow up , and embrace the future . Staring slack-jawed into an ugly desktop is so 2006 . This is 2012 and the tech-hordes want change . Change is hard to invest in though . Change leads to fear , and fear leads to the Dark Side . But what Microsoft has done is nothing short of a binary revolution . <p> One device fits all <p> We , and I use the royal " we " here , want pretty pictures and instant response . We 've come to accept the fact that information is instantly handed to us in notifications , instant messages and status updates . Why should n't our OS be the same ? Windows 8 CP is that OS and it 's going to change the world , so wise up and get with the program . <p> What I enjoyed about Windows 8 CP is that the same experience is offered across most Microsoft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phone all use the same type of interface in varying degrees . And you know what ? It works . It 's a smooth ride and users can jump from one device to another without ever losing a beat . It 's called the Metro UI and works as well , if not better on touch-based devices . <p> Getting used to the new interface presents an issue for long-time Windows users . The Live Tiles are daunting , constantly shifting to present new ideas , ever buzzing with information . You quickly get used to it though . <p> I enjoyed the " People " app though . Think of it as a contact list on Windows Live . Hell , it 's got the exact same interface and functions like the Windows Phone interface . It links to everyone in your social networks , draws out details and creates a fairly meaty phonebook with very little effort on your part . Me likey . <p> It 's not as powerful as the Mail or Messaging app , both of which are pared down to exquisite simplicity . Messaging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hotmail and Outlook mail into a melange of information . The new " all-screen " format of Windows 8 CP pushes the information into the forefront . It 's clean , spares and readable . <p> The included Xbox Live app is a replica of the Xbox 360 's service . Find friends , clothe your avatar and launch games ( eventually ) . I was unsurprised to see how well it was replicated on PC , considering that Microsoft drives the good ship Xbox . <p> SkyDrive , Windows 8 CP 's stab at cloud-services , is fairly useable , letting you pick which files you want to upload . In the full-fledged SkyDrive App ( coming soon says Microsoft ) , automatic syncing between local and cloud files will be the norm . <p> And Internet Explorer ? It 's back , and it lets you download Chrome , so Kudos for that . Ironically , Internet Explorer is pleasant enough but it 's such a tightly-walled environment and I ca n't even begin to stomach it in its new Metro guise . <p> The Microsoft PDF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scroll quickly . What more could a boy want ? No toolbars messing up the interface and that 's what the PDF Reader delivers . <p> Dude , where 's my Explorer ? <p> As I said earlier , some will lament the " loss " of Explorer , the tried and tested UI of past Windows efforts . Not I , says the interface lover . <p> You ca n't access the Start menu anymore . It 's gone and pressing the " Windows " button shifts the view back to the Metro homescreen . You can still press Windows key and tab to change to running apps , or hover over the top-left portion of the screen to access recent programs . <p> Charms , which rarely worked in Windows 8 DP , run like a bomb on CP . Any open app has its corresponding Charm , or app options . Hover the mouse to the right side of the screen and the Charm bar appears . Dandy , and handy . The default Charm bar lets you access the settings , but not all of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar is integrated into the Charms bar . Never again Microsoft , never again . <p> In all fairness , Explorer remains alive and well in Windows 8 CP , but it 's supposed to stay hidden for the default user . After a day of use , you 'll wonder why you ever needed it as open apps default to full screen , but if you prefer , can be minimised or docked as it was with Windows 7 . <p> Windows key plus " R " will run any app directly from prompt . So there , no one can complain about the loss of Explorer . I ca n't comment on the touch aspect of Windows 8 CP ; my non-touch laptop merely complained every time I pressed its LED screen . <p> One more thing <p> You need to have a Windows Live account to run Windows 8 CP online . If you do n't enter your details , the system is a faceless ghost , spewing random information without context . Once you sign up with your Windows Live account though , your life is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Note , you can link almost every social media account into Windows 8 , eliminating the need for separate Twitter , Flickr or Facebook apps . <p> One word that comes to mind with Windows 8 CP is polished . Every inch of Windows 8 CP absolutely stinks of polish . From the sliding windows to the fast-loading apps to the most usable interface EVER CREATED ( patent pending ) , Windows 8 CP is a delight to use . This is a good start to a bright , Metro UI focused future . <h> Author Bio <p> Steven Norris is a born writer , living in Tamboerskloof , Cape Town and educated in the ways of graphic design but destined to follow in the footsteps of the worlds greatest authors .

" <p> Mnisi said rural development had been placed high on the agenda , and the ministry viewed the South African rural community 's safety as a priority . <p> " This priority therefore needs to find concrete expression in our policing strategies and we need to ensure that our programmes speak adequately to this important issue .

It incurred losses when it initially began trading . <p> " The respondent suffered substantial losses in its first eight months as the casino was not a popular venue . <p> " The applicant recognised that foot traffic on the premises was due to the attraction of the respondent 's restaurant and in fact that it was a model tenant .

@@827234 <h> Jak and Daxter Trilogy ( PS3 ) <p> Naughty Dog , the creators of Uncharted , did n't just happen to be making those great adventure games by chance . The team cut its teeth on both the PlayStation and PlayStation 2 . Crash Bandicoot got better with each release on the original Sony console , and by the time the PlayStation 2 was released , Naughty Dog was ready to astound its fans again with a great platformer title : Jak and Daxter . More cinematic and with greater environments it used all the power of the Emotion Engine to bring the characters to life . <p> Jak and Daxter Trilogy contains the original three games in the series , all available in high definition , and if your television supports it , also available in 3D . All three games have been updated with fresher graphics , the most obvious being an overall sharper image thanks to the higher resolution . You can also pick up on a few textures that are probably higher res as well . <p> What really struck me was when I looked at a few YouTube videos , just to compare the original games to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animation , and the level of detail I expected to find as an upgraded feature was already present in the original . I feel ashamed to say that I expected the HD collection to need a lot more work than the work that was done in the end . It could easily pass as an earlier PlayStation 3 game , rather than a previous generation game . <h> One for the money <p> The first game in the series , The Precursor Legacy , sees Jak and his friend Daxter , two elf-like creatures , start off on their incredible journey . Through a series of comical events Daxter falls into a bit pit full of Dark Eco , a sort of evil magic . He emerges as an ottsel , a cross between an otter and a weasel . <p> As this agile little critter it is Daxter who quickly steals the show . His funny one liners and on-edge personality is the perfect mix of humour in a game that , when you think about it , does not really have that much substance to it . Jak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong silent type . Together they travel the world in search of more Eco and freeing the Sages of the world who have mysteriously vanished . As is tradition with games designed as a trilogy it ends on a decent cliffhanger . <h> Two for the show <p> Jak II : Renegade follows on directly from where the first game left off . Jak , Daxter , Samos the Sage and Keira , Jak 's love interest , all travel through a portal to a new world where Jak is promptly captured by Baron Praxis . After two years of torture and experimentation , Daxter finally breaks Jak out of prison . In this new world of Haven City our dynamic duo sets off to revenge Jak 's long term in captivity . It is apparently enough for Jak to actually start talking ! <p> The game differs almost nothing from the first when it comes to the core mechanics . You still collect orbs and jump and grab ledges and do the usual platforming antics . Jak is a little bit more dexterous with a few new moves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get ready <p> The final entry to the trilogy is Jak 3 , set a few months after the events of Jak II . Haven City is saved , but as is tradition the peace is not meant to last . Metal heads attack the city and Jak is blamed for this before being banished to the wasteland . Here he makes new friends and even enjoys a bit of time travel . <p> Again the game improves on the previous title with bigger worlds , more powers for Jak to use and lot more travel across large deserts with buggies . It also concludes the trilogy as it was originally written , which by the way ends up much better than the first game hinted it would be . <p> As an open world platformer there are no load times , and the level transitions between the different zones and themes without any hiccups . The level design throughout the collection is top class with an easy entry into each game , just in case you have never played an action adventure platformer before . <h> Now go Jak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most loved platforming games ever created , this series really deserves a second look from any gaming fan . It still carries some legacy problems that existed back in the day . The camera has not been refined and compared to newer titles it is clear that Naughty Dog learned valuable lessons during the production of the series . As for our friend Daxter , they just do n't make them like they used to ! Daxter has to be one of the most annoying and best loved Ottsels ever created . <p> The good : Classic platformer action ; Blast from the past ; Three games in one ; Daxter steals the show ! <p> The bad : Still plagued by legacy problems like the camera ; As good as it is it looks , a little old compared to modern titles

If you knew what you were talking about you would understand that the line speed or download/upload speed has nothing to do with the response time between point A and point B. Your 200ms is pretty shit by the way ... i have upgraded my line speed to a 2meg , i am getting 168ms. and you stating " are you expecting 10 ping or something ?

NO MATTER WHAT LINE SPEED YOU HAVE ... Its not about the totaly bandwith speed you have , but about THE TIME IT TAKES to TRAVEL A DISTANCE . that is WHAT PING IS ... This is true when you test one meg , two meg , 6meg aswell as 10meg . True as the testing factor , ping , was done as a comparison between myself and friends on a stable day ... <p> What you say about your downloads spiking your ping , is due to normal trafficing being done by your isp . You are making your game ping sit in traffic that you caused by downloading . See a download as 1kb/s = one car on a highway . Lets say you have a 4mb line , then your highway can support 400 odd cars . Gaming uses about 20+/- cars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highway slowing down the flow rate of your data . What you say is true , but yet again it has nothing really to do with the original topic . <p> I got a 2meg line by the way , not one meg Please let go of your 10 years gaming experience . it has done you nothing to understand what a PING is . <p> Gareth <p> you are right about local servers and i get the highway Analogy and I understand and agree completely . <p> My ISP is Mweb , Internet bandwidth Supposedly is prioritized for gaming so if someone in the house has there torrents going full blast I should n't have any problems according to tech staff .. when I had my capped 2mbps line ... It put the L in LAG . <p> but please explain how German servers in Bf3 give you 200-220 Ping ( Germany to SA is roughly 8000-9000km ) then you have UK servers which give you the same ping but its closer ? <p> hell if a friend of mine tried to google something or youtube something while i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post said you had a 1mbps line lol , tried my best to help you and you now have a 2mbps line so that increase of speed must have helped .... 3rd world problems =/ <p> End of the day anything below 10mbps is shit ... been checking out those VDSL packages Mweb offers for 20mbps and 40mbps .... uncapped but not unshaped/unthottled ... You do n't happen to know anyone that uses these packages do you ? or on another ISP ? <p> Martin <p> The difference between German and UK servers , is that Seacom takes us to there central " European hub " located in France i think . Everything from there on is Fiber optic lines , so the ms difference between a UK server and a German server should not be a noticeable difference due to France being a central point to the EUW . We have such a notable ms difference from CPT to JHB due to copper cabling and bad routing/clustered cabling . Just one exchange point that is done bad , and everything upstream will be shit . Torrenting makes ALOT of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the highway doing 2kb/s . So u should lag real hard ingame when someone torrents : p they can only prioritize the gaming ports that have been identified and properly forwarded . <p> Hope i clear some things up for you : p <p> http : **34;1169;TOOLONG Steffin Greyling <p> Internet is a joke ( in SA ) .

@@842238 <h> Education <h> Holding government to account <p> Court action to enforce minimum norms for school buildings comes not a moment too soon . <p> Recent widely reported disruptions of teaching and learning , all related to inadequate school infrastructure , show the urgent importance of the legal action launched last month against the government to address this long-standing problem . <p> Last month pupils at Menziwa Senior Secondary School in the Eastern Cape burned down their school and 98 pupils were arrested for arson . <p> This followed months of appeals to the provincial education department by school staff , parents and pupils to address problems such as prefabricated classrooms with holes in their walls and exposed electric wires ( " We do n't need no education , just some bricks in the wall " , Mail &amp; Guardian Online , March 16 ) . <p> Also last month , the furore that followed Democratic Alliance leader Helen Zille 's " refugee " tweet began as a political argument between her and the ANC over an overcrowded school in Grabouw , which is in Zille 's domain , the Western Cape . <p> Such problems are not recent , either at these schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been appalling for years . Compounding it was a tornado that damaged the school in 2010 , as well as a severe storm last year . Enrolment numbers at the school dropped , absenteeism increased , matric exam pass rates declined and teacher morale plummeted . <p> To take only one other case of long-standing infrastructure shortcomings , consider the classroom conditions at Mkanzini Junior Secondary School near Port St Johns , on the border of the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal . <p> The school originally operated with five mud structures , built by the community , but these collapsed following severe storms . <p> In 1993 the then Transkei government intervened and four new classrooms were built late that year . These were insufficient to accommodate all the pupils and the community built three additional classrooms in 1994 with salvaged materials . But , in 2009 , a fire destroyed the four permanent classrooms . <p> An engineer sent by the provincial education department to assess the damage found that these structures had to be torn down . But the school continued operating with the three remaining community-built structures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 400 pupils and the school then used its own resources to construct another three shack classrooms . It also built another two permanent structures , using donations and money from the school 's operating budget . <p> Diverting funds from the operating budget has prevented spending on basic and essential school materials , including furniture and ? textbooks . Teaching is impossible at times because of bad weather : the roofs leak , the windows do not have glass and the dirt floors become a marsh when it rains . <p> Widespread experiences The experiences of these schools are widespread . The basic education department 's 2011 figures indicate that there are nearly 25 000 public schools in South Africa . <p> Of these , 3 544 ( 14% ) have no electricity supply , 2 402 ( 10% ) have no water supply and 23 562 ( 93% ) do not have stocked and functioning libraries . <p> How do we make sense of these basic infrastructure shortcomings nationally ? <p> The legal action launched against the government last month by the non-governmental organisation Equal Education centres on one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulations to hold provincial departments to account for ensuring that schools have adequate infrastructure , such as satisfactory shelter from weather conditions and all the necessary facilities . <p> The indispensable and empowering right to basic education is recognised by numerous United Nations bodies . In South Africa , legislation and policy since 1994 have acknowledged basic education as essential to the development of the human personality and an ? individual 's sense of dignity . <p> The country also recognises that education is the primary vehicle by which economically and socially marginalised people can lift themselves out of poverty to participate meaningfully in society . <p> In the national policy for the equitable provision of an enabling school teaching and learning environment , published in 2010 , Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga stressed the importance of the physical environment in which teaching occurs . <p> Still no action Despite all these clear and unequivocal recognitions , the government has still not introduced minimum norms and standards for school infrastructure -- the focus of Equal Education 's application in the Eastern Cape High Court in Bhisho last month . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimum norms and standards need to be introduced urgently . <p> Firstly , the regulations will legally require provincial MECs of education to draw up plans on how they will meet these minimums . They will also periodically need to report to the minister on their progress , which will strengthen the national government 's oversight role . <p> Secondly , communities , pupils , civil society organisations and the public will know what to expect from the government . A clear policy framework with defined and measurable targets will empower people to monitor the government 's ? performance and hold it accountable for meeting its obligations . <p> Equal Education 's application does not seek to prescribe the content of the norms and standards and does not ask the court to do so .

In the Eastern Cape the department had only spent 28% of its allocated budget by the third quarter -- a significant shortfall from its 75% target . <p> Even more worryingly , not a cent of the national infrastructure backlog grant had been spent , despite being earmarked for the eradication of mud schools in the country . <p> If nothing else , enforceable regulations will give the minister the power to determine how ? provinces must spend on school infrastructure and provide a means of ? evaluating actual expenditure as it happens and monitoring its progress . Binding standards will make it easier to identify problem schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The introduction of minimum norms and standards is an essential starting point for addressing the infrastructure crisis affecting schools . Without them , many South African pupils will continue to face school conditions that are not only uncomfortable , but also sometimes dangerous . Frequently , they make any kind of learning impossible . <p> Motshekga and the other respondents in Equal Education 's action -- Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and the nine provincial education MECs -- have until April 10 to file a notice of intention to oppose the suit in the court . <p> Given the deplorable state of many schools across the country and how this violates not only the fundamental right to basic ? education , but also pupils ' right to dignity , the introduction of ? minimum norms and standards simply can not be seen as optional .

At the heart of this tiff : an A-line , high-waist skirt with frill detail on the waistband . <p> Sindi alleged this week that Stoned Cherrie 's Nkosi ripped of the design of his skirt that was showcased at Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Jo'burg on March 10 ; Nkosi 's similar skirt hit the catwalk at SA Fashion Week in Rosebank last weekend . <p> " I was very surprised to see the skirt , which is remarkably similar to mine in pattern , detail and proportion , walking down the runway . Certain editors and bloggers immediately alerted me to the glaring similarity , " said Sindi . <p> He told the Mail &amp; Guardian that he began exploring his design in August two years ago and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his series of collections over three seasons . <p> " I debuted it officially at Jo'burg Fashion Week in February 2011 as part of the winter collection , " he said . " The skirt was designed to combine the decadence of a very full hemline with a slimming waistband and the whimsy of a paper-bag style frill at the waist . When I landed my deal with Edgars , the skirt was central to the collection and was in all five stores from September 2011 . " <p> Nkosi , the founder and creative director of Stoned Cherrie , said the brand 's skirt was created at the end of 2010 . " We had designed a box-pleat waist skirt before for an Amsterdam-based exhibition in Cape Town called Salon/locale in February 2011 , which Harry Lekwane , one of our designers , had conceptualised before the exhibition . <p> " We are not aware of any copyright that Thula Sindi has on this concept and should he believe that it was stolen , then are we to assume that he also stole the concept from Prada and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is a remarkable similarity in the 2010 collections of Fendi skirts and both Sindi and Nkosi 's skirts . The main difference is that the Fendi skirts were minis , whereas Sindi and Nkosi 's fell to the knee . <p> The international fashion world is no stranger to such rows . Last year , Christian Louboutin sued Yves Saint Laurent for using his signature red soles on Yves Saint Laurent shoes . In this case the conflict highlighted two facts : even though red-sole shoes were not a new concept , it was Louboutin 's brand identity . But can one company really monopolise a colour ? Not according to the courts : Louboutin lost the case on appeal . <p> Dion Chang , trend analyst at Flux Trends who covered that battle for the Sunday Times , said that in fashion most designs had already been done before . " If you go through fashion history archives , you will probably find it , " Chang said . <p> " Moreover , we are inspired by osmosis and assimilation . In this day and age , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to claim something completely as yours , because I think somebody will find something that is so similar that you could argue both sides of the coin anyway . " <p> But Sindi does not appear to be backing off . " Perhaps it is accidental and if so , perhaps Stoned Cherrie will be kind enough to not make the skirt commercial , " he said . <p> But neither is Nkosi budging . <p> " It is a sad day when designers resort to mudslinging before researching whether their allegations hold water . Stoned Cherrie has not been in the industry for 12 years by accident , nor by mimicry , " said Nkosi . <p> This rivalry seems to carry with it remnants of the long-time battle between the two fashion world doyennes : Dr Precious Moloi Motsepe of African Fashion International , which holds fashion weeks in Cape Town , Johannesburg and Africa where Sindi showed his line , and Lucilla Booyzens , of SA Fashion Week , where Nkosi showed hers . <p> Booyzens take on plagiarism in the fashion industry ? <p> " Plagiarising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " One needs to find one 's own voice , but one needs to make sure that it is plagiarism , one needs to ask oneself where the design originated .

@@851240 <h> Brands that have stood the test of time <p> What do Coca-Cola , Cadbury , Levi Strauss &amp; Co. , Volkswagen , KFC , Marlboro cigarettes and Mrs Balls Chutney all have in common ? They all have lived through at least one World War , the rise and fall of Communism , the ' flower power ' 60 's , the first man on the moon , bad hair of the 1980s and not to forget the most recent financial crisis . <p> None of these brands is an absolute physical necessity , yet these brands have always been a part of our lives - and do n't seem to be going anywhere . <p> If you take time to consider some of the great brands that have always been around , they pretty much still look the same , taste the same and feel the same . For example , in the 1920s , Marlboro the world 's largest selling cigarette brand , initially targeted female smokers with their ' Mild as May ' tagline and feminine focussed advertising . In the 1950s they changed direction to a more niche market of male smokers - but since then , very little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60 years with still the same cowboy ' Marlboro Man ' , product and packaging . 60 years of success without much radical change is rather astounding . <p> The great brands that have been around for many generations have all stuck to their brand values and personality . They 've been consistent , while adapting and refreshing themselves as consumers and market conditions have changed - but all have done so without comprising their core brand essence . Take Coca-Cola for instance - from 1886 to 2005 the famous beverage brand has had 168 different taglines , yet their brand positioning has remained fairly consistent . <p> As the saying goes : " If it ai n't broke , do n't fix it " . Coca-Cola learnt this the hard way when introducing ' New Coke ' in 1985 , a reformulation of the product with a campaign slogan of ' The new taste of Coca-Cola ' . New Coke attracted great consumer backlash and subsequently led to the re-introduction of the original , classic Coca-Cola . <p> So what can brands of today learn from the good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have mentioned ? <p> Firstly , ruthless consistency over time pays . Cadbury has always stuck with their signature purple ; and consistently market their ' glass and a half ' of milk in each chocolate . Similarly , Volkswagen has constantly focussed on people . KFC has the ever present Colonel Sanders and special ' 11 herbs and spices ' recipe consistently applied to the marketing campaigns . Consistency is critical to ingrain your position and message to customers . When a company , product or service is unpredictable or confusing , the reputation of a brand becomes questionable and simply can not build momentum . <p> Next , rather refresh than radically change : People fall in love with a particular brand for a specific reason - whether it is what the brand stands for , its personality , its product or service offering or the message it sends out . Like a person , if any of these characteristics change fundamentally , the brand can lose its integrity and subsequently its fans . Levi Strauss &amp; Co. has achieved success as the classic jeans-wear brand with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet , when Levi 's discovered that a large proportion of women were unsatisfied with how jeans fitted ( or rather did n't fit ) their all-important derri ? re , they quickly responded with the Levi 's EVA range that was designed especially for ladies with a few more curves . They did this without compromising their classic heritage or completely overhauling their product range . A refresh from time to time is essential to stay abreast of market trends and to avoid complacency . In 1991 , Kentucky Fried Chicken refreshed their branding and name to KFC taking into account that people were opting for healthier methods of cooking and therefore chose to focus less on the ' Fried ' in their name . <p> Finally , do n't underestimate the power of your product ( or service ) in building and maintaining a strong brand . No brand will last over time if the product and the value associated with it , is not up to scratch . The strength of Mrs Balls Chutney lies greatly in the product itself . No other competitor , locally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste and flavour of this South African favourite . The reliability of the product is solid and thus , the power of the brand is undeniable . <p> Though many of the famous brands may not be necessities or items that guarantee our physical well-being ; they still are cherished and loved throughout the world . Through careful brand management these great brands have made us smile , satisfied our cravings , brought people together and most importantly , have been dependable .

That was the time God died , well , for myself anyway . The death of the deity was caused by the very followers which support that deity . <p> That spark , which ignited memories of long ago , was struck this morning by a different source and unexpectedly . . I have been pondering the thought for a long time before deciding to put it in print . Some will hate it and others will say : " I told you so " . As usual there is no malice intended to either side of the God question . <p> During 1974 I was occupied on a mine in the middle of nowhere : Life was a bore and people sought to entertain themselves even if it was via religion .

The OACSA has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaven and God dwells in the heads of mankind . Mortal human beings can gain the power to lock or unlock the portals of heaven when empowered to do so by the high officials of the church . That great power was imposed upon Zion Pay too .

The contradiction never touched me and much less other fanatics . <p> The church had no buildings and services were held in the homes of the congregation . And the word was passed on from lazy-boys to comfy settees . The magnet being the tea and cookies after the service . In this case my home had to provide the shelter whilst the lay priest called down the wrath of heaven ( Still non-existent ) upon the heads of those wayward losers.I am English and my late wife was Afrikaans and all hated us for our matrimonial choices and handed the case to god to sort out . That was the lightest and most enjoyable burden I bore for 35years .

He told me all those that do not heed the word of god . I felt the hate in the congregation . My wife was stressed and pregnant about 6 months . Got up and told the congregation to leave my home immediately and grab some cookies as they pass them . They left and so did their god . <p> A year later we go to a similar church in Namibia . The priest does not turn up so after the service a carton of cigarettes is purchased for the priest and a visit is made due to thoughts that he might be ill or something similar . The front door is ajar and a voice screams out for us to f**koff . So the priest said . We found the wife of the priest laying on the floor beaten to a pulp .

@@905236 <h> Teachers ' colleges to be reopened <p> The Education Department intended reopening at least two former teachers ' training colleges in KwaZulu-Natal , with the first taking new admissions in 2014 . <p> But , while the government 's about-turn on the controversial decision to close the colleges countrywide in the 1990s has been widely welcomed , the provincial Education Department has opted to err on the side of caution in its reaction . <p> Department head Nkosinathi Sishi expressed concern about the quality of instruction these institutions would provide -- in light of the previous problems that led to them being closed . <p> University of the Free State vice-chancellor Jonathan Jansen had been especially critical of the decision to shut teachers ' training colleges . <p> Academics , school governing body foundations and teachers ' unions have echoed these sentiments , arguing that the consequence would be a shortage of teachers as well as a shortage of teachers with pedagogical skill . <p> The announcement last month by Higher Education Minister Blaze Nzimande that the colleges would be re-opened in Mpumalanga , the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal was therefore applauded . <p> However , Nzimande 's department said the re-opened colleges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would function under the auspices of existing universities . <p> Asked where in KZN the colleges would be situated and when classes would commence , the department was tight-lipped , saying it was investigating the issue . <p> " The Department of Higher Education and Training is investigating the current utilisation of all the former colleges of education .

@@905237 <h> Making gangsters our protectors <p> PresidentJacob Zuma 's administration is schizophrenic . This description is consistent with the views in both of my previous assessments , although I did not use this particular provocative term . The schizophrenia lies in the administration 's desire to pursue a progressive inclusive economic agenda , while simultaneously advancing a traditionalist , conservative social agenda . <p> The former is reflected in the industrialisation plan of the Zuma regime , the New Growth Path , the infrastructural development agenda and related plans . While some in business may chafe at the idea of the state intervening in the economy , I believe it is necessary for creating an inclusive economic future . <p> The social conservatism manifests itself in the militarisation of the police , the attempts to curtail transparency , and the initiatives to empower rural elites vis- ? -vis citizens . In the earlier years of this administration , the focus in this regard was on the militarisation of the police . <p> South Africans were two-minded about this . Tired of the scourge of violent crime , many were willing to give this a shot . The tragic murder of Andries Tatane last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can lead to . <p> This past year , however , the Zuma administration has moved its agenda of social conservatism up a notch . We have had the Protection of State Information Bill -- the secrecy bill -- written by the minister of state security to determine what should be classified , how this should be done , and the penalties for those who expose this . <p> This was followed by the Traditional Courts Bill , which really empowers traditional leaders and disempowers rural citizens . <p> It is effectively creating two sets of citizenship and two distinct forms of political rule , one for the urban and the other for the rural . Many people in the rural areas will be subject to customary law and the political rule of the chiefs even when this violates the substantive intent of our constitution . <p> In previous years , the fulcrum of the political administration had been on economic transformation . This year it has tilted to the social arena . Moreover , the economic transformation agenda seems mired in discussion , and its implementation has not yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Zuma administration has on balance taken on a deeper conservatism than any previous ANC government . <p> In the absence of any further ominous trends , I would have reduced its formal assessment to 30 percent , down from 52 percent and 40 percent in years one and two respectively . <p> But there have been new developments with ominous consequences for our collective future . In the life of any political administration , there comes a moment when one event defines it for ever . <p> Let me present the context first before I describe this moment . We have now had two commissioners of police , both of whom were cavorting with criminals when they were meant to be putting them behind bars . <p> Jackie Selebi was fraternising with Glenn Agliotti , a known drug kingpin , smuggler and criminal . Bheki Cele , we are now told , was not only implicated in the building lease scandal , but also had close ties to the criminal fraternity , and in particular to a convicted drug dealer , Panganathan " Timmy " Marimuthu . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but crime intelligence is said to have employed him and his family on the public payroll and loaned him a state vehicle . You could not get a better script for a Monty Python movie . <p> In any case , given this sad state of affairs , which the president contributed to by appointing Cele in the first place , one would imagine that he and his minister of police , Nathi Mthethwa , would proceed with care in the next appointment . <p> Not Zuma and Mthethwa ! The minister -- one has to assume with the blessing of the president -- proceeded to appoint Richard Mdluli as head of crime intelligence and we were told that he might even be in the running for appointment as the next national commissioner of police . <p> This is an individual who may have been involved in the murder of his rival in a love triangle , Oupa Ramogibe . <p> To plead the principle of " innocent until proven guilty " is nonsensical . We do not give awaiting trial prisoners -- who have not been proven guilty yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a breach of principle . It is called responsible governance . You can not appoint someone with a charge like this hanging over their head as the most senior official in crime intelligence . <p> If Zuma or his minister know something we do n't , then , given the circumstances , they are obliged to take us into confidence . <p> If they do not , their decisions delegitimise the police service . Let me put this in perspective . The fundamental reason that citizens give their allegiance to the state is because it is meant to protect their lives . <p> This did not happen in the case of Ramogibe . Instead , his family have been subjected to living in fear by the very people meant to protect them . <p> For making gangsters our protectors , Zuma should be allocated a zero . <p> l Yesterday , Mthethwa announced that Mdluli would be moved to another division in the police , effective immediately . <h> Comment Guidelines <p> Has a comment offended you ?

@@905238 <p> Hawks head Anwa Dramat is adamant he would like to see his crack unit remain firmly entrenched in the South African police . <p> " I think it will be most effective within the police , given that the directorate of priority crime investigations Hawks wo n't handle all cases . The South African Police Service has the structure to investigate crimes ; we just do part of the sharp end , " said Dramat during a tea break in Parliament . " We work together with the SAPS . We have good relationships with them . " <p> Dramat and his legal team joined members of Parliament this week to fine-tune the South African Police Service Amendment Bill to try to ensure it will satisfy the requirement of the Constitutional Court , which ruled that it should protect the Hawks from political interference . <p> Whereas most of the submissions to the public hearings on the Bill held by the parliamentary police oversight committee lobbied for the Hawks to be an independent body , Dramat is certain it is where his unit belongs . <p> The Hawks boss is a man of contrasts . Softly spoken , with a humble manner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Umkhonto weSizwe . He was sentenced to 12 years on Robben Island for his MK activities and political convictions . <p> " Legislation will protect us " His name also emerged in the hearings of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission as a torture victim of notorious security police interrogator Captain Jeff Benzien . <p> It is only when he talks about how the Hawks will retain their independence that he shows a steely side . " The legislation will protect us , " said Dramat , confidently . " We will have our own finances ; we can make our own appointments . " <p> Not many have as much faith as Dramat that the Hawks will manage to be independent , given the fact that the Bill , as it stands , will place the national police commissioner as its accounting officer who will have the ultimate authority over the unit . Taking into account the country 's recent history of people placed in this position of power being toppled , he appears surprisingly undaunted at the prospect . <p> Speculation has been mounting that the head of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder and fraud charges levelled against him , will be the next national police commissioner . It now looks less likely because Mdluli has been removed from his post pending the outcome of the ongoing investigations against him , Police Minister Nathi Mthethwa announced this week . <p> When the complaints mechanism for the Hawks became operational again it would assist in preventing political influence , Dramat said . The Bill makes allowances for a retired judge to be appointed to run the complaints mechanism , which enables anyone to complain if they believe there has been political interference . However , the position has been vacant since last year . <p> Morale is goodDramat said this was because the Constitutional Court had ruled on the police Bill and no appointment was made after a retired judge quit the post last year . <p> " This complaints mechanism is an important provision of the legislation , " he said . " Any person has recourse to the judge if they feel there is political influence over a case . " <p> Asked how the debacle around the reinstatement of Mdluli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Hawks is dedicated to their work . Morale is good . " <p> He firmly declined to comment when pushed on whether the infighting between the top brass over Mdluli had not derailed his unit . <p> It is alleged that some members of the police top brass , including Dramat , have been angered by accusations contained in a letter that Mdluli wrote to President Jacob Zuma alleging that his bosses and senior colleagues were co-conspirators in a campaign to discredit him . <p> InquestsAlthough the National Prosecuting Authority has withdrawn murder and fraud charges against Mdluli , the Mail &amp; Guardian established last week that Dramat had withstood extreme political pressure to allow a fraud investigation into the crime intelligence chief to continue . <p> This investigation has allegedly uncovered a concealed bank account , described as a second " slush fund " . Mdluli was earlier accused in an internal police report of looting the crime intelligence secret services account . <p> Asked whether anyone in the Hawks had asked for protection in light of the fact that senior NPA prosecutor Glynnis Breytenbach had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the road , Dramat said no one had experienced similar problems . " We have n't had any reports of intimidation of our investigators , " he said . " Our investigators are trained police officers who can defend themselves . " <p> The seemingly unbowed Breytenbach , who has wanted Mdluli to be prosecuted on fraud charges , was suspended last week and will face a disciplinary hearing . <p> Mdluli also faced murder charges last year relating to the death in 1999 of Oupa Ramogibe , the husband of Mdluli 's former girlfriend . These charges were investigated by the Hawks , but the case was suddenly abandoned by the state in favour of an inquest . A senior police source has alleged that it was merely a ruse to delay proceedings because " those inquests can take years to complete " . <p> " Why was the murder case against the accused withdrawn when they had a case to answer ?

@@914233 <p> The issue of convenience is a strange one in Gaborone . In a city with an abundance of malls and shopping centres , one might have assumed the convenience factor had been satisfied to death . <p> The thing is , though populated with all the necessary stores , the type of stores on offer remain pretty standard , and even simple aspects such as supermarket opening hours are unfavourable . The elusive convenience factor , then , is precisely that : elusive . <p> Imagine that stroke of joy when you realise you can in fact go out for a pretty memorable sushi dinner ( yes , in Gaborone ! ) and that you can still pop into the supermarket after 9pm for whatever last minute things you may need . The convenience stretches further in that you can find your decor , furnishings and the latest LG flat screen TV all in one place without having to walk a mile just to get from one end of the shops to the other . This is certainly not news to those who frequent Sebele Shopping Centre , a mall which has made it its mission to be " conveniently yours . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ includes Pick ' n Pay , Woolworths , Milky Lane , restaurants , hardware and furniture shops , professional services outlets , and a pharmacy . Conveniently located on one of the city 's busiest roads , the A1 , Sebele Centre has proved that even in a city filled to the brim with massive malls , it can often be easy to lose sight of the fact that , at the end of the day , what we really want is a convenient place with quality products which can be accessed from all points of the compass . <p> The Centre has somewhat of a niche market , specialty store feel . It is geared almost towards a lifestyle and home d ? cor market beyond the generics of your run-of-the-mill franchise stores . Whilst furnishing one 's home ought to be a joyous process , it can often become a tedious task when you are forced to zig-zag across town from one shop to another . Now , this need no longer be the case . From furnishings in Mukwa Interiors to d ? cor and gifts from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from The Linen Box , the mall pretty much has it covered . Those looking to deck their homes out with the latest electronics need go no further than the iStore for computer gadgets or the LG store for state of the art appliances and flat screens . There is also a strong food element , including a Chinese restaurant , Mintt Cafe and fast food outlets Debonnairs , Milky Lane and the newly opened Barcelos . <p> With shopping malls popping up all over the show , there 's something rather wonderful and full of character about Sebele Centre . It has exactly what you need , without going overboard , and you get a real sense that their " conveniently yours " slogan is a genuine one . Sebele Centre has personality ; and it 's this personality that enables this average-sized go-to centre to stand out against a sea of megamalls . Even when it is all the way across town for some people it maintains that once-elusive appeal of convenience , and yet still has the draw of being able to satisfy that sushi craving and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exponentially , the irony lies in the fact that there is some disparity between what we hope will happen and what actually happens . Instead of making our lives easier and more convenient , the increasing abundance of malls and shopping centres actually leaves us painfully spoilt for choice . You find yourself trapped in tiring parking lots , confused by a multitude of entrances and wasting a whole hour to get into the supermarket just for a quick milk run . It is refreshing , then , to find a place that has not lost sight of what it means to make the shopper 's experience easier , more convenient , and actually enjoyable , all the while offering something that is just a little bit different .

@@927232 <p> When Samsung sent us its Series 7 Slate tablet PC to review a couple of weeks ago , we could n't resist the temptation to ditch Windows 7 from its 128GB solid-state drive and install the consumer preview of Windows 8 . After all , Windows 8 is designed from the ground up as a tablet-friendly operating system and we wanted to kick the tyres , so to speak . <p> The process was a little tricky , but a Google search quickly revealed the most difficult part would involve creating a Windows boot disk on a portable USB hard drive with the Windows 8 installation files on it and making a few tweaks to the slate 's BIOS . Once we 'd overcome those hurdles , getting Windows 8 up and running was a breeze . <p> Once the software was set up , we downloaded proprietary drivers from Samsung 's website , set up the stylish Bluetooth keyboard that ships with the Series 7 device -- or , at least with the particular version we reviewed -- and we were up and running with the pre-release version of Microsoft 's latest and arguably greatest operating system . <p> But before we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardware underpinning this machine . It features a Core i5 processor -- no Arm-based chip here , which means it runs the full Windows experience , including applications like Office 2010 . <p> The unit comes standard with a stunning 11,6-inch LED-backlit LCD panel with a resolution of 1 366 ? 768 pixels in 16:9 format . The screen offers brightness of 400 nits . It 's not great in bright sunlight , but displays vividly indoors . The machine has 4GB of RAM and integrated Intel graphics processor . <p> Naturally , Wi-Fi is built in , including the fast 802.11n variety . There 's no GPS , though . <p> The left side of the slate sports two volume buttons , a USB port , a 3,5mm audio jack and a mini HDMI port for hooking it up to a monitor or TV . The right side has the on/off/sleep button and an orientation-lock button . There 's also a microSD card slot . Frustratingly , especially for SA users , there 's no support for mobile networks and therefore no Sim-card slot . <p> The built-in rear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a low-resolution front-facing camera for Skype calls and vanity shots . <p> Battery life is disappointing , offering between three and four hours of life , or about a third of Apple 's new iPad . We guess that has a lot to do with the screen real estate and the Core i5 processor , but it 's the biggest single problem with the machine . <p> In terms of design , the Series 7 is one of the sexiest Windows slates we 've seen . Weighing in at 934g , the machine is just 13mm thick and is covered in an attractive brushed plastic ( which , unfortunately , scratches quite easily ) . The dimensions of the screen are , however , a little unusual for people used to the iPad 's form factor and we found using the device in portrait mode was simply not as comfortable an experience as landscape mode . <p> The unit we reviewed came with dock -- which doubles as a stand and charger and offers an extra USB port as well as Ethernet and full-sized HDMI ports -- Bluetooth keyboard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the actual slate to stow the pen , meaning it 's easily lost . Bear in mind that the Series 7 does not have an external mouse , so if you plan to use the machine more as a PC than a tablet , then you 'll probably want to buy either a Bluetooth or USB-powered external pointer . <p> The front of the device has one button , with a Windows logo on it . In Windows 7 , pressing it brings up Samsung 's own app launcher software . We 'd love to tell you how Samsung 's additions to Windows 7 help make the operating system more touch friendly , but in our haste to install Windows 8 we admit we did n't spend much time playing around with it . In Windows 8 , of course , the Windows button brings up the new operating system 's gorgeous tile-infused and Metro-style start screen . It 's the first time we 've played with Windows 8 on a tablet/slate and the user interface works like a dream .

This is a little disappointing as the tablet would be great for watching movies . Be prepared to wear headphones to listen to music and to watch movies unless you can put up with too little treble . <p> It 's hard to know what the target market for this machine is . Perhaps it will appeal to company executives that want a tablet but just have to have access to the full Windows experience . Even then , they 'd be better advised to hang on to their Windows laptops until Microsoft releases Windows 8 later this year . <p> What the Samsung machine does do is give us a great teaser for what 's coming when Windows 8 , with all its touch-friendly functionality , is released later this year .

He said he had heard rumors of the child even before then when he was rector but took Williams ' word they were n't true . <p> Corcuera acknowledged that even after he confirmed Williams ' paternity , he did nothing to prevent him from teaching morality to seminarians or preaching about ethics on television , in his many speaking engagements or his 14 books , including " Knowing Right from Wrong : A Christian Guide to Conscience . " <p> Williams , for example , was the keynote speaker at a Legion-affiliated women 's conference just last month in the U.S. <p> Williams admitted last week he had fathered the child after The Associated Press confronted the Legion with the allegation .

This was an error in judgment , and yet another thing I must ask your forgiveness for , " he wrote , according to the text obtained by the AP . <p> Williams has not identified the mother or said whether he was supporting the child or in any way involved in the child 's life . The Legion has said the child is being cared for . <p> Revelations of Williams ' child have further eroded the Legion 's credibility and compounded the scandal at the order , which in 2009 admitted that its late founder , the Rev. Marcial Maciel had sexually abused his seminarians and fathered three children with two women . Maciel , who founded the Legion in 1941 in Mexico , died in 2008 . <p> The scandal is particularly grave given that Maciel was held up as a model for the faithful by Pope John Paul II , who was impressed by the orthodox order 's ability to attract money and young men to the priesthood .

" The Vatican cited problems of the Legion 's culture , in which silence reigned and authority was abused , as being in need of reform , as well as the need for its constitutions to be rewritten and its charism , or essential spirit , to be defined . <p> Following an AP investigation , the Legion on May 11 admitted that seven priests were under Vatican investigation for allegedly sexually abusing minors , an indication that Maciel 's crimes were not his alone . Corcuera provided an update Tuesday , saying two of those cases had been dismissed , leaving five abuse-related cases under investigation by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith . <p> Another two priests are being investigated for other sacramental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have inappropriate sexual relations with women . <p> In his letter Tuesday , Corcuera announced that the Legion was going to review all past cases of allegations of sexual abuse to ensure that they were handled properly .

I can never say for sure , " Corcuera wrote . " I can , however , tell you that we are following the lead of Pope Benedict XVI in dealing with abuse and sexual misconduct in the Legion .

The final proposal was submitted to the SKA Siting Group on 15 September 2011 . <p> On the basis of its analysis of technical , scientific and other factors , the SSAC unambiguously and by consensus found in favour of the African proposal , as well as the African implementation plans and cost factors . Consequently , the SSAC recommended South Africa and its partner countries as the preferred site for the SKA . <p> The decision by the SKA Organisation to build the majority of the SKA in Africa coincides with our celebrations for Africa Day today .

Since 2005 , we have awarded nearly 400 grants and bursaries to postdoctoral fellows and PhD and MSc students and undergraduate students . <p> We remain committed to the SKA project . <p> I would like to thank my Cabinet colleagues , especially the Interministerial Committee on the SKA , the Deputy Minister of Science and Technology , scientists and astronomers , the Presidency , officials at the Department of Science and Technology , in particular the Director-General , Dr Phil Mjwara , and Dr Bernie Fanaroff and the entire team at the Square Kilometre Array Project Office for their unwavering support . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

One way in which companies are unlocking innovation through knowledge and creativity is via an approach known as crowd sourcing . This method enables a company to broadcast an issue to a wide-ranging and diverse audience -- using a variety of social media and collaborative software solutions , enabling interaction and ultimately a resolution to the problem . <p> I strongly believe crowd sourcing is set to shake up business processes this year , and more companies will adopt it as a strategy . Organisations that have already employed this have experienced solutions to internal problems and innovation needs . 2012 presents a strategic opportunity for CEOs and leaders to champion a collaborative digital approach that will allow an organisation to reap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Planning for today and tomorrow <p> One area where crowd sourcing can have a huge impact on business operations is within the supply chain . In the past , many businesses have invested heavily in technology to improve process efficiency . These investments have included traditional ERP platforms that allow companies to gain quick end-to-end visibility of the supply chain . <p> These systems do not , however , offer much support to evaluate the impact of risk on the supply chain . This often leaves managers making decisions supported by reports written with a monthly perspective -- looking backwards at problems that have occurred rather than planning ahead and anticipating or managing them in real time . <p> A lack of adequate risk evaluation leaves organisations exposed to higher costs , can have a negative impact on service levels , and leave a business open to significant fire fighting . Additionally , the savings made in improved efficiency at the operational level are often negated by the cost of a solution , such as urgent transport , in an emergency . <p> Instant feedback <p> Crowd sourcing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to supply chain management . It enables a business to react instantly to demand changes or problems and subsequently minimise the risk ( and consequent impact ) and potentially generate advantage from unforeseen events . <p> Crowd sourcing presents a potential treasure trove of influence and insight to a company 's changing environment -- which can have immediate impact on core operations , such as supply chain management . <p> For example , there are an increasing number of social media tools , mobile and location services that make it simple for people to broadcast data about where they are and what they are doing . This means a plethora of real-time information is constantly available , from pinpointing roads in need of repairs to which stores are out of stock on a particular product . <p> For businesses this real-time data could prove an invaluable aid alongside planning and forecasting technologies , to help deal with unexpected logistics issues such as motorway closures , air freight delays , disasters and extreme weather .

However , they will also be thinking practically about the impact the Games will have across operations , as well as on the supply chain . <p> The Olympics are likely to cause a host of disruptions , particularly around travel . Taking advantage of the insight that crowd sourcing offers -- by keeping abreast of communications on social networks , for example -- will allow businesses to increase the flexibility and dynamism of their supply chains and enable quicker reactions to changing circumstances . <p> A new crowd <p> In my opinion , 2012 will see crowd sourcing become a key enabler for agile response and process handling ; and CEOs and business leaders who begin to integrate it into their day-to-day operations will see the most benefit . <p> This means businesses must begin to establish ' listening posts ' on various communication channels -- such as the various social networks -- to capture critical conversations that can drive process decisions within the supply chain . Managers must filter these messages and identify those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picking up on extreme weather alerts can help an organisation to react instantly and source alternative transport routes . <p> Crowd sourcing is an enlightening tool for managers to posses but it is equally as essential that companies are able to make informed long-term business decisions to support their longevity . <p> To do this , businesses need forecasting systems which provide accurate statistical information based upon historical sales and dynamic parameters that continue to learn . Additional information can then be layered on top of this base information to provide a clearer picture of likely demand . <p> I believe that data assimilated though crowd sourcing can then be used to support and verify the suggestions given by forecasting systems . For example , supply managers could combine logistics-related information such as road closures with demand forecast-related information , such as products that are trending and popular locations , which may cause spikes in product demand . <p> Having access to this over-arching information will allow supply chain managers to update both current and future planning parameters and improve the flexibility of the supply chain .

I 'd been based in Malaysia on a book tour , out of touch with South African news . But that 's not to say I was unaffected by events in my host country . <p> I was in Kuala Lumpur when the opposition grouping , Bersih , gathered in public protest against the ruling party , Barisan Nasional , a Malay-dominated coalition that has ruled the country since independence in 1957 . <p> Dissatisfaction at issues from corruption to electoral legislation had seen an opposition alliance of Chinese and Indian minorities , and former United Malay National Organisation leader and Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ebrahim , capturing a number of government seats and state legislatures after the 2008 elections . <p> This was when Ebrahim had brashly predicted that he would be taking over the country from Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi , only to fall short . It was , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentiment in our last election , only to later wipe out on the rocks of over-reached ambition . <p> With the very broad tripartite church of the ruling Malay-dominated Barisan Nasional having become the focus of widespread public dissatisfaction , similarities to South Africa were not lost on me . <p> Malaysia is constitutionally a democracy , but its political landscape has been controlled for more than 40 years by Barisan Nasional -- a party strong on affirmative action for Malays in an economy dominated by the Chinese . <p> Interestingly , former prime minister Dr Mahathir Mohamed -- the wise old fox of Malaysian politics -- had said in response to the 2008 election results that the traditional Barisan Nasional 90 percent majority had not been good for democracy , and that the new 60-40 split would be healthier . <p> At social gatherings I was assailed with accounts of what were seen as the country 's problems . Corruption and executive incompetency due to nepotism came up strongly on the conversational radar . Comparisons are odious , I know , but once again I could n't help seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cadres such as Richard Mdluli , Menzi Simelane and Bheki Cele -- who have all been publicly discredited in terms of their aptitude for high office -- sprang to mind . <p> Malaysia also had its fair share of Mdlulis , Simelanes and Celes . But that 's where the comparisons petered out . I told my hosts that , as a South African , I did n't want Kuala Lumpur 's traffic jams and high-rises , but that I would welcome its low food prices and subsidised fuel . And with Malaysia 's Gini Co-efficient impressively lower than ours , I said we would be happy to have their low unemployment rate of just under 3 percent . <p> I said complaints about crime were a trifle compared to ours . I had to give the rider , though , that South Africa was safe for the visitor -- as the biggest question I faced was on how safe it was to walk in the streets of Johannesburg or Cape Town . <p> Literacy <p> Basic Malaysian literacy is high and I was told that internet and wireless communication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of over 90 percent -- in other words , 22 million people out of 25 million had access to digital communication . <p> However , I could also see -- our pressing socio-economic challenges aside -- that we had made huge strides as a nation since apartheid . Our human rights culture is , I feel , more entrenched and strongly defended in South Africa than in so-called " mature " democracies . <p> I remember , for example , speaking to a government official who told me that Malaysia had only just rolled out a minimum wage limit for workers of 900 ringgit ( R2 420 ) . In South Africa , this question is old . <p> I had an interesting chat with an executive from a prominent international HR company , which had branches in Africa . He reminded me that South Africa 's affirmative action copied much from the Malaysian model . <p> " AA needs to get your young people to work . Your universities are good and your young people must be given opportunity , " he said . Experience had taught him AA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He explained that AA would become dysfunctional and affect service delivery if it became the domain of the ruling elite . <p> On the media side , most media houses were government controlled ( though I did do a series of interviews with private radio station BFM ) . I missed the rough-and-tumble of South African journalism and the healthy cynicism of public figures , sometimes too pompous for their boots . <p> It also reinforced my view that freedom of speech is probably the most precious legacy of the post-apartheid era . Few countries can speak their minds as we do and it made me think about the travesties of the understandably condemned Protection of State Information Bill . <p> In Malaysia , the tameness of the institutional press was more than made up for by a vigorous blogging community . In that arena , I could see the gloves were off and it was in cyberspace -- and not the mainstream media -- that political scandal circulated . <p> When your country is viewed from afar , it can be revealing what people think of you .

I was informed that the UMNO elders would never give its youth wing the rope the ANC gave its Youth League . <p> President Jacob Zuma was perceived as a somewhat benign , if not avuncular , figurehead associated more with Brics than the AU ( like Thabo Mbeki ) . There was more a polite curiosity about his multiple marriages . But the most dominating personality by far was still Nelson Mandela . " Mandela magic " still shines brightly in the foreign imagination , and I think we sometimes forget his iconic status as a symbol -- not of struggle and liberation -- of reconciliation . <p> When I mentioned in talks that he 'd drunk tea with Betsie , the wife of Hendrik Verwoerd , jaws would drop in amazement . And when I reminded audiences that one of the first things he 'd said upon release after 27 years of detention was " Forgive but do n't forget " , there 'd be a murmur . <p> Coming back to the anger , indignity and political opportunism of the presidential organ being exposed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my Far Eastern friends ) , I realised I 'd forgotten just how raucous freedom of speech could be -- especially in a multicultural society such as ours.Yes , " Spear of the Nation " or not , it was good to be home .

The show is choreographed by Durbans Taryn Makaab , below . <p> Burlesque with a tweak and much contemporary zing is what you can expect from the latest and most ambitious production by Durban 's Break Thru Dance Company . <p> It is an enthusiastic fusion dance troupe under the expert guidance of Taryn Makaab , who founded the company in Morningside in 2009 and is its director and principal choreographer . <p> The upbeat new show , titled Neo Burlesque , and featuring a 28-member cast , slots in at the iZulu Theatre at Sibaya Casino , near uMhlanga , from Thursday to Sunday next week , with performances at 8pm and a matinee scheduled for 3pm on Sunday . <p> The company includes Kai Pretorius , a top-eight finalist from SA 's 2010 season of So You Think You Can Dance ; Rachel Abrahams , a graduate of South African Theatre Ballet ; and one of African Footprint 's recent dancers , Simone Mann . <p> Besides the dancers , the revue will feature live vocals by Tammy Saville , Collette Johnson and Simone Mann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team of Pretorius , Cobus Wiese and Hannah Katerere , the show follows four previous seasons by the company of productions titled Under Construction and Dollz , the first of which was staged at a church in Florida Road , where the company was founded . <p> Neo Burlesque marks the first time Makaab is not appearing in a revue she has choreographed for the troupe . <p> It also marks the company 's first outing in a large , 579-seater theatre . <p> " Our first show saw us turn a church into a theatre . We then upscaled to the Suncoast Casino , then The Zone , and now the iZulu Theatre , " says Makaab . <p> The recent Cher and Christina Aguilera film musical , Burlesque , provided her with the inspiration for the production . <p> " I loved the movie , but for my show I wanted to bring in more dance genres . " <p> She adds : " Neo Burlesque is a fun take on burlesque but with a contemporary and hip hop flavour , and also elements of neo-classical and cabaret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she says , pointing out that the production follows a loose theme of two female dancers fighting over a male dancer while also fighting for stardom by reaching for a dream . <p> Makaab 's goal with her young company is to start touring next year : " We have an opportunity to tour China with an African musical , and from there , hopefully , we will go all over to spread the diversity in our culture .

She 's not a journalist and does n't spend much time on social media . Her friends say she 's opinionated and every now and then she strings a few sentences together to have her say . <p> 05 Jul 2012 10:52 ( South Africa ) <p> I am a doctor working in the state sector , and this is my response to the article entitled ' Baragwanath 's Shame : A good man dies ' . <p> Firstly , I want to give you an idea of what a typical weekend morning is like in the trauma unit of a South African tertiary hospital . It 's 8am on a Sunday , and the morning handover round is just starting in the unit . The weekend 's carnage is plain for all to see . The resuscitation unit is over-full , serving as temporary home to seven ventilated patients . These are people so critically ill that they need what lay-people call ' life support machines ' to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their bodies because they ca n't take those breaths themselves . In the passage is an eighth patient on a stretcher , being manually ventilated by a paramedic . They have been there for three hours , waiting patiently for a space to open up in the resus area for them . <p> Down the passage are more patients , wedged as closely together as possible . They 've all suffered some sort of trauma : they 've been stabbed or shot , hit by cars or thumped by thugs , throttled by their boyfriends or beaten by community members . Some of them are elderly people who fell and broke their hips whilst on the way to the bathroom , others are teenaged boys who broke their legs playing soccer . They 've filled up all the stretchers in the unit , and have flowed over to the chairs , wheelchairs and benches . One has made a nest of blankets on the floor . They 're asking for water and bedpans and receivers to vomit into . They 're asking for help and pain medication . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They tell us that the intensive care units are full , so there 's nowhere for the critically ill patients to go . Theatre ran at full steam all night , doing ' red ' ( that means very urgent ) case after red case , leaving no time for the more minor but nevertheless critical operations : those patients who are ill , but not bleeding to death . <p> They tell us that they 're on ' one-to-one ' with the state hospital twenty kilometres down the road , which means that both major hospitals in the city are full to the brim , and that it will soon become almost impossible to accommodate even one or two more critically ill patients . We need to get through our round quickly , so that we can clear some space for those who are surely en route . <p> There 's a horde of people to discharge : those who waited hours and hours to be seen and investigated , because the tide of patients was too much for the scanty nursing and doctoring contingent to stem . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come and fetch their people home , so that we can strip their beds and remake them for new bodies . We need to look at the ventilated patients and decide which ones we can save , and which ones we probably ca n't . And then we need to switch machines off . <p> People are n't happy , and we can hardly blame them . They 're at their most vulnerable : in pain , weak , sometimes confused , and now they 're lying in a big room where they have no privacy , little autonomy , and often no idea of what is going to happen next . They often do n't know how they got there and do n't speak the language of the people who are supposed to be helping them . Even if they do , it 's difficult to convey their needs and questions : the nurses and doctors are running around and shouting and have no time , no time . It 's a nightmare of tears , bodies and blood . And it 's happening in every town and city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Waal 's article detailed the horrific shack fire in which Maggie Molefe and Godfrey Tenehi found themselves trapped . According to her report , they were taken to Chris Hani Baragwanath hospital by paramedics , but were initially refused entrance as the hospital was too full . After some heated words and a few phone calls they were allowed in , but Tenehi died later that day , despite being in the same building as a major burns unit . The family does n't understand . <p> I 've been a doctor for almost six years . This is not a long time , I know , but I 've spent all six of those years in state facilities of various types : huge tertiary hospitals near city centres , eighty-bed secondary-level hospitals in the middle of townships , a tiny district-level hospital in a farming town . So I know a lot more about the public health care system in South Africa than the average private medical aid user . And I can tell you , Tenehi 's story is not exceptional , or unusual . Whilst I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a patient away without first assessing their fitness for transport , I was not surprised or shocked by the outcome . <p> Doctors and nurses working within the South African public health care system are the face of a failing organisation . Even though we are simply employees of the organisation , we are the patients ' access point to the system . When they need to wait an unreasonably long time to be helped , we are the ones telling them to wait . When there is no bed for them to lie on , no blanket to cover them , and no food for dinner , we are the ones telling them they ca n't have these things . When there is no help to be had , and they or their loved ones are going to die , for whatever reason - incurable disease , or absent resources - we are the ones who tell them . As such , we take a lot of abuse . We get accused of being lazy , of being too slow , of lacking compassion . And sure , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are , after all , only human . Some humans are less perfect than others . <p> We should n't , however , allow our feelings about how perfect we expect nurses and doctors to be to blind us to the real problem , which is the shambles in which the Department of Health has left our healthcare system . It is not clinicians on the ground who decide how many hospitals there should be , how many beds those hospitals should contain , what services those hospitals should offer , and how well those hospitals should be staffed . Those things are decided by administrators , as they should be . Those administrators are appointed by the Department of Health , also as it should be . And the Department of Health is run by a bunch of politicians , who are doing the most terrible job of representing the interests of the people who put them there . <p> Mandy de Waal 's article made me angry , not because I do n't want the horrors of state hospitals reported on , but because of her failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She scratched the surface and told us one thing : that doctors sometimes act without compassion and do n't properly communicate to patients and families what is happening . But she could have dug deeper and pulled out the evil root at the base of this ugly tree to show us . The public healthcare system is appalling . It is not equipped to deal with the burden of disease in this country . Whether this is due to a lack of funds or simply mismanagement and wasting of available funds is a question worth asking . Whether or not it can be fixed by changing the people running the system is another . <p> Mandy de Waal asked me in a tweet whether or not I 'd eschewed my private medical aid in favour of public health , and my answer is no . This is not because I am afraid of the doctors I work with : many of the state-employed consultants I 've had the privilege to learn from are considered world experts in their fields . My colleagues are dedicated and skilled , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't trust the state to provide me with a ventilator when I catch a life-threatening pneumonia . I ca n't trust the Department of Health to provide enough staff to run enough theatres to operate on me if I 'm in a terrible car crash at the same time someone else gets shot in a hijacking . <p> I do n't know if Godfrey Tenehi could have been saved . Shack fires are always tragic , as is the loss of a loved one and a breadwinner . But there is more to this story than a couple of heartless doctors . We choose our leaders , and as a society trust them to manage the resources we give them : our tax money , our skills , our time . We expect them to use these resources to our advantage , to keep us safe and happy . The public health system is failing in this regard .

@@1010231 <h> The South African Style of Super Rugby <p> 05 July 2012 , 13:19 <p> Some rugby pundits do n't really like the flairless style of rugby being played by the South African teams in the Super Rugby competition.Then again its just their opinion right ? Correct me if I 'm wrong but currently this is how most fans see the South African Conference style of play : <p> 1 . The Bulls are playing a 60% attacking &amp; 40% defensive rugby . <p> 2 . The Stormers are playing a 100% defensive rugby . <p> 3 . The Sharks are playing a 70% &amp; 30% attacking &amp; defensive rugby . <p> 4 . The Cheetahs are trying to play 100% attacking rugby . <p> 5 . Lions , well looking at the overall log table then it looks like they just making up the numbers . South African teams are mixing it up by not trying to compete with the styles of New Zealand and Australia , but rather with the scoreboard where it all really matters . And it 's winning rugby that counts no matter how its done is it not . <p> The point is some people complain about how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a attacking free flowing style of rugby . If winning rugby is all that matters then why should the Stormers be going against the grain ? The Bulls played " boring rugby " according to some pundits with their kick and chase game , but still won the Super Rugby title in 2007 . Yet nobody complained about that achievement afterwards . <p> For the past 10 years the Stormers have been living off scraps as it were by not having a dominant forward moving pack and just running the ball from almost everywhere on the park just for the sake of it . The Stormers now do have a competitive pack with a safety first game plan and its so far so good in that we top the South African conference table . I 'd rather the Stormers have a " bore-fest " style of play than a try-fest style and we 'd still be at top of the conference.Defense is as big a part of the game as what offense is . When the Stormers played " attacking " rugby a few years back , did it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its our defensive style of play that got us where we are at the minute . Is having a good defensive setup then regarded as lack of playing quality rugby these days ? What exactly is " total rugby " ? We often hear how New Zealand teams sets the standard for this type of high scoring games but that do n't necessarily mean exiting rugby . Rather a closely fought low scoring game are just as exiting and entertaining as the big scoring ones because it keeps you on the edge of your seat . Total rugby is therefore not just about a try scoring run feast , but how each team manages the full 80minutes of game time , how well their try line is defended , the brute physicality and forward power of the players , their psychological dominance , the on-field decisions and more importantly the execution of your working game plan . <p> Disclaimer : All articles and letters published on MyNews24 have been independently written by members of News24 's community .

@@1010239 @ @ @ @ @ transition and normal transitions are effectively intergenerational handovers . The worst situation is that of war , which disrupts transition . South Africa is not at war , so we have to focus on facilitating the development of new leadership cadres . But how does this happen ? To whom ? And what are the determinants of readiness ? <p> We are a nation of the young . Our demographics confirm this . The National Development Plan outlines this . A large number of South Africans are between the ages of 15 and 29 . Although the country has not reached the 30% mark , viewed as the dangerous " youth bulge " in developing economies , this cohort will make up more than a quarter of the total population until 2030 . From 29% of the total population in 2010 , the percentage of youth will decline slowly to 25% in 2030 . A " youth bulge " has the potential to destabilise countries , especially where there is rampant unemployment . <p> Our present demographic profile presents a tremendous opportunity , but it also constitutes a serious risk , given that joblessness mirrors age and race fault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unemployed below the age of 35 . Unemployment rates are highest in the 15- to 24-year-old group ( 46.6% in 2008 ) and second highest among 25- to 34-year-olds ( 26.2% ) . For black youth , the unemployment rate is 65% . If a young person fails to get a job by the age of 24 , they are unlikely ever to get formal employment . Unresolved , this trend poses the single greatest risk to social stability . <p> I believe it is imperative that young people are represented properly . In other words , a political handover to sensible young people is not only advisable , but also necessary . <p> In South Africa , much of the political " heavy lifting " has already been done . We had to organise ourselves against apartheid -- risking life and limb -- and we succeeded . We are still standing to tell those tales . We had to convene elections with great intensity because our first crop of representatives would be the crafters of our Constitution . <p> I want to invite you to read the Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Thabo Mbeki and Cyril Ramaphosa succeeded brilliantly . The first generation of parliamentarians had to draft and adopt new legislation to replace apartheid laws . The task is ongoing , but let the record speak for itself . <p> Political changes I operate in the world of politics , where logic does not always reign supreme . Elected leaders hate to hand over authority . Consider the political changes around the world in , say , the past year . The Greek elections were convened after a failure to produce a majority , even by combining the three largest parties . Consider the election battle between Nicolas Sarkozy and Fran ? ois Hollande in France ; take a trip to Russia and examine the musical chairs played by Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev . <p> Then travel to Australia to understand the infighting between Prime Minister Julia Gillard and her predecessor , Kevin Rudd , in the Labor Party . Be horrified by the stories from Syria , where Bashar al-Assad 's government has unleashed a cruel military against its people . Ask why an awful war is raging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then flip across to Mali in West Africa to try to understand the military coup . <p> And then agree with me that logic is not an attribute available in large measure in politics . I would also like you to agree with me that those who fill the employment square on forms with the word " politician " have done nothing to inspire the next generation to consider political office . Yet , in politics , as in life , there has to be a handover . And , as with all hand-overs , the more orderly the better . <p> My first question to you is whether you are ready . I am not speaking of storming the Bastille . South Africa needs a generational mix of people in leadership . I am seen as a campaigner for generational mix , so let me add a caveat : age can not be the only criterion . Leadership has to be about values , respect , discipline , persuasion and a series of softer attributes . The worst leaders are those who lack the maturity to understand that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader and that power is a force to be managed with utmost care and respect . <p> The work in the National Planning Commission that I have been privileged to lead has been the most fascinating journey . The commission has 25 of its 26 members drawn from outside government . It has a powerful mandate to describe the South Africa we need by 2030 and to take a hard , critical view of where we are and what impedes our journey towards that future . <p> Out of play Collectively , we have declared that , by 2030 , our generation will be out of play -- either to the next life or to the rocking chair -- and your generation will be the decision-makers . Be it in politics , institutions of higher learning , corporations , or just in life , we acknowledge that you will be the decision-makers . <p> So , in Youth Month , let me declare this strategic objective . We have looked towards 2030 and implementation must start now to get to that place described in the commission 's vision : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we have remade . We have created a home where everybody feels free yet bonded to others ; where everyone embraces their full potential . We are proud to be a community that cares . <p> " We have received the mixed legacy of inequality in opportunity and in where we have lived , but we have agreed to change our narrative of conquest , oppression , resistance and victory . <p> " We began to tell a new story of life in a developing democracy . We began to share freedom and the uncertain . " <p> To get to this vision , we have to believe ourselves capable of creating a new story , not some distant future fiction . The hard work has to start now . <p> Readiness <p> So , how ready are you ? Readiness should never be confused with appetite for a lifestyle . The readiness I refer to is the boring stuff of hard work and intense learning . I am not asking you to travel the same route our generation did -- and , yes , I am part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will not have to take . I , for example , joined the ANC at the age of 23 , with the objective of being a guerrilla . <p> I did not join the movement to become a minister . Political power was not even on the horizon yet . I knew I would probably be arrested and tortured -- and that proved correct . So the intention could never have been to realise the lifestyle I now enjoy . <p> I am not asking you to face prison and torture -- the bulk of you are already too " larney " to fit that in between your next facial and gym session ! I am asking something different . I am asking you to be prepared to learn . And when you ask what , I will reply with the words of the poet Bertolt Brecht : <p> Study from bottom up , for you who will take the leadership , it is not too late ! Study the ABC ; it is not enough , but study it ! Do not become discouraged , begin ! You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now ! Study , man in exile ! Study , man in the prison ! Study , wife in your kitchen ! Study , old-age pensioner ! You must prepare to take command now ! Locate yourself a school , homeless folk ! Go search some knowledge , you who freeze ! You who starve , reach for a book : it will be a weapon . You must prepare to take command now . Do n't be afraid to question , comrades ! Never believe in faith . See for yourself ! What you yourself do n't learn you do n't know . Question the reckoning -- you yourself must pay it Set down your finger on each small item , asking : where do you get this ? You must prepare to take command now ! <p> I am also asking you to work hard at what you do , not only in your immediate occupation but in the service of others . Service is not about income ; it is about placing your skills , knowledge , time and other attributes at the disposal of others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lots of money . The easiest thing is to write a cheque for some cause , but that is not service . Societies develop and sustain momentum because of service . <p> I said earlier that in the realm I work in , politics , the amount of logic available is frequently deficient . Yet we have in this country a leader who voluntarily set the terms for his occupation of the seat of highest authority -- Nelson Mandela . <p> Madiba is horrified by the notion that some people have that he is a saint . As an active leader , he was tough , wily and determined , but he possessed both the foresight and the charm to persuade people of what was in their interest . <p> As part of your preparations , as part of your acquisition of values , as part of changing your own lives in order to change this country , you have an amazing opportunity in July . No , not just on July 18 in celebration of Madiba 's 94th birthday , but every single day . Do something that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being in service of others . <p> That is how you cut your teeth for leadership . That is how and where you will learn .

@@1010240 <h> News and events <h> South Africans talk social cohesion <p> 5 July 2012 South Africans have embarked on an in-depth process of deciding what kind of society they want to create ? and a major part of that process is the National Social Cohesion Summit taking place at the Walter Sisulu Square of Dedication in Kliptown , Soweto . Some 3 000 delegates joined summit host President Jacob Zuma , arts and culture minister Paul Mashatile , members of the cabinet , MPs , and representatives from the various political parties and civil society bodies , to come up with a declaration of what needs to be done to create a caring and proud society . The summit is taking place on 4 and 5 July 2012 , and features discussions on the role of organs of state such as the judiciary , Parliament and other legislative bodies and political parties , as well as the role of civil society , including business and labour , and other NGOs such as the Foundation for Human Rights , Molo Songololo and Lead SA .

@@1021230 <h> Revitalise indoor plants <p> INDEPENDENT NEWSPAPERSZEN-LIKE : Create a relaxation corner with bamboo palms and a variegated yucca . <p> Winter has arrived with all its icy cold winds and freezing nights . Although pansies , calendulas and fairy primrose are now thriving in the cold , it is worth taking a look at your indoor living spaces and revitalising your indoor plants . <p> Experienced gardeners will tell you that if you want a great indoor garden this winter , follow the three golden rules of indoor gardening : replenish , repot and replace . Follow these guidelines this weekend . <p> Replenish <p> Start by cleaning the leaves of your indoor plants and checking their water requirements . In the course of a year , indoor plants collect dust which can block the leaf pores . Make sure that the dust is removed from the top and bottom of the leaves . For small indoor plants , put them in a bath or shower and give them a gentle spray of lukewarm water . For larger plants , a warm wet cloth will do the job . <p> Most people are unaware that overwatering is the main reason why indoor plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to killing it with kindness . So , how often should you water your indoor plants ? The generally accepted advice is that a plant should be allowed to become moderately dry between waterings . <p> Water your indoor plants thoroughly every 10 days rather than give them a little water every few days . A little water only penetrates the top few centimetres of soil and will rarely get down to the roots . A good watering will reach all the roots and benefit the plant in the long term . In winter , reduce the watering schedule of indoor foliage plants as they go into a semi-dormancy in midwinter , but never let them become bone dry . The best time to water plants is in the morning when they still have the daylight hours to use the water . How to water is as important as when . The first rule is never use cold water -- especially in cold weather . Use tepid or lukewarm water . Your plants will absorb it more easily , and it will not send them into a state of shock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indoor plants . Are roots growing out of the base of the pot ? Are the new leaves on the plant smaller than the existing leaves ? Does the plant dry out quickly ? If the answers are " yes " , your plant needs a larger home . An average size indoor plant will need a new pot that is 5cm wider and deeper than the original . Smaller plants will need a pot one size larger -- usually an increased diameter of 2cm . Avoid the temptation of buying an enormous new pot . The roots of the plant will flounder and it will not be comfortable . <p> Before moving any plants , wet the soil slightly so the plant will slip out easily . Untwist matted roots with a fork , and trim twisted roots . Layer the base of the new pot with pebbles for drainage , fill in the sides with potting soil , and water thoroughly . Commercially produced potting soil for indoor plants is sold at all garden centres . <p> Replace <p> In reality , there is no such thing as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to grow outdoors , but some are naturally adapted to similar conditions . Generally speaking , plants that prefer shade will do quite well indoors , but some will not grow well in stuffy or dark corners . <p> The level of light in a room is the biggest limiting factor indoors . A zone of 2m away from a window is deemed to be bright light . However , beyond 2m away from the window , it is already much darker . Natural light is at its lowest far from windows or in rooms with small windows such as bathrooms . <p> Orientation is another factor to consider . A north-facing room generally has quite good light , but a south-facing room is rather dark , even near the windows . East-facing rooms get cool , morning sun and west-facing windows get very hot afternoon sun . Knowing where the plant is to grow , and what the light-levels are in a room , decides your success in choosing the right plant . <p> As part of your revitalisation strategy this month , move plants which are struggling in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Accept that dark passageways are not a good place for plants and find more suitable d ? cor . Identify empty corners that have enough light to sustain plant life and fill them . There are a range of indoor foliage plants for areas of high , medium and low light .

Appreciate that most flowering plants do best in bright light . Try cymbidiums , cineraria , cyclamen , poinsettias , chrysanthemum or begonia .

" <p> And that is just what circumcision , a procedure to remove the foreskin , does , according to three randomised trials , " the gold standard of medical evidence , " he maintained . <p> Critics argue circumcision is medically invasive and less effective than safe sex practices , such as using condoms , at reducing sexually transmitted infections . <p> Tobian agreed that condoms are highly effective , but contended they are not used enough . <p> " In the United States , we 've had three decades of safe sex education , but just last year , there were 19 million new sexually transmitted infections that cost our health care system $17 billion .

@@1097233 <h> A new plan to finance Africa 's SMEs <p> The African Guarantee Fund ( AGF ) , officially launched in June this year , is a scheme designed to ease access to finance for Africa 's small and medium enterprises ( SMEs ) . How we made it in Africa 's Dinfin Mulupi spoke to Passwell Shapi , capacity development director at the AGF , about what the fund seeks to achieve . Below are excerpts . <p> Passwell Shapi <p> What is the AGF and what does it seek to achieve ? <p> The AGF was founded to , among other things , address unemployment among the youth in Africa , which I can describe as a time bomb . The SME sector ... has been identified as having a great potential to address this problem . <p> The sector , however , faces a myriad of challenges , key among them is lack of , or inadequate , access to finance from the formal financial sector . Most entrepreneurs struggle to raise finance for their businesses and use alternative fund raising avenues like borrowing from shylocks . This obviously stifles businesses because if you are borrowing at 10% a month -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- such a business will not survive . <p> SMEs face challenges in accessing finance because they largely lack the collateral which banks ask for . It is for this reason that the African Development Bank ( AfDB ) , the Danish Government ( through Danida ) and the Spanish Government ( through AECID ) came together to create AGF with a mission of providing , among other services , financial guarantees to banks on behalf of bankable SMEs . AGF 's guarantee facilities as well as SME banking capacity development assistance will enable banks to significantly scale up their SME lending activities . <p> Is cash all it takes to build SMEs in Africa ? <p> No . It takes more than just financing to build a sustainable and vibrant SME sector in Africa . In this regard , AGF through its capacity development assistance programme , will be rendering assistance to SMEs to , among other things , strengthen their governance , general managerial , financial managerial and marketing capabilities . <p> Are African banks truly geared towards funding SMEs ? <p> Indeed they are . It used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ target transnational firms , but over time you and I will agree that the transnational firms have scaled down their operations in Africa and a number of them are no longer involved in any manufacturing activities at all . The few transnationals remaining in Africa as well as the large local corporates are not only very price sensitive , but also lack loyalty to banking relationships . This type of business for banks today is a non-growth segment and banks aggressively pursuing this sector , risk using their shareholders ' funds to subsidise the true cost of such relationships . <p> Many banks have today realised that the only way to remain viable and sustainable is by diversifying to SME banking . Admittedly , SME banking has its own challenges such as information asymmetry and lack of , or inadequate , collateral . That 's why institutions such as the AGF come in handy with financial guarantees and capacity development assistance through which banks could devise alternative and suitable credit appraisal techniques for SMEs . <p> What kind of impact will the AGF have on Africa 's SME sector ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities to SMEs . As the SMEs benefit and grow , they will create job opportunities and foster economic growth in their countries . This will also solve the problem of youth unemployment in Africa . Whereas foreign investment is increasing in Africa by virtue of the continent having become the next economic frontier , the types of investments we are seeing are of the labour saving technology type and thus with very minimal ability to create jobs . That is why we should encourage our SMEs to benefit from opportunities associated with Africa being the next frontier , through banks leveraging AGF 's facilities in scaling up their operations in the SME space . <p> Where do you see the fund in five years ? <p> The fund will be acknowledged as a positive change facilitator in enabling the so-called " missing middle " in Africa to have significant access to finance from the formal financial sector . Its impact will be felt across the continent .

@@1097236 <h> Groundhog what ? The Loerie Awards chairperson responds <p> Boniswa Pezisa <p> Boniswa Pezisa <p> Boniswa Pezisa is the Chairperson of The Loerie Awards . <p> 23 Aug 2012 02:07 ( South Africa ) <p> Earlier , Mandy de Waal wrote that marketing blogger Herman Manson had been denied accreditation to the Loerie Awards evenings . The story became not so much a storm in a teacup as a tempest in a teapot , culminating in a heated debate about the nature of censorship . But that 's not quite where things stand -- Manson just was n't that steady a PR investment . <p> The Loerie Awards representatives do not generally respond to specific reports by the media . But a recent report by Mandy de Waal makes some points that we feel compelled to address . While we understand that this is an opinion piece under Daily Maverick 's Opinionista banner , which essentially means that the author 's opinion is not necessarily shared by the publication and that the author is not required to substantiate her views unduly , the ' facts ' which formed the basis of the opinion were misrepresented -- and some things were claimed which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an influential and credible media platform and we would hate to think that readers might form an opinion of a high-profile event that injects up to R100 million into the local economy based on one instance of axe-grinding which many might well confuse with " good " journalism . As we are all well aware , media freedom is an issue that evokes hugely emotional responses in this country . The fact is that many of the follow up questions directed at The Loerie Awards have taken " Groundhog Day at the Loeries " as gospel rather than opinion , and that is why we are now responding to the allegations made by De Waal . <p> ( Disclaimer : in an industry famous for getting the point across in thirty seconds , we 're going to need a bit more time than that to respond . Thank you for understanding . ) <p> On August 14 , the Daily Maverick published an opinion piece in which De Waal reported that marketing blogger Herman Manson had been denied accreditation to the Loerie Awards evenings scheduled to take place in Cape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paragraph , De Waal quoted the City of Cape Town 's Grant Pascoe , who said : " We would not stand for any journalist to be banned from any event that we are involved in , " thus cleverly establishing in the mind of the reader that Manson had been " banned " from the Loerie Awards . <p> De Waal puts forward her stance most succinctly in the comment she wrote below the original piece in response to a reader who had commented that he failed to see why the failure of Manson to get free tickets to the awards amounted to censorship : <p> " Censorship is a fairly broad concept and ranges from outright silencing to trying to control the output of the media . The Loeries blackballed Manson in 2010 . They are now trying to limit his freedoms . Whatever way you look at it , they 're trying to control his output in the rather naive view of ' protecting ' the Loeries image . <p> Strangely enough their apparent attitude echoes what 's going down in government . It is akin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' . The management of the Loeries needs to mature in terms of its attitude toward the media . Let 's hope they do just that . " <p> In order to address the points made by De Waal , we 'll summarise the premise of her argument as the following : <p> 1 . Herman Manson did not receive accreditation for the awards evening ; this amounts to a limitation of his freedoms and an attempt by The Loerie Awards to " control his output " . <p> 2 . The Loerie Awards representatives are trying to ' protect ' their image by not giving Manson accreditation to the awards evenings . <p> 3 . A contrast can be drawn between The Loerie Awards and the City of Cape Town , which allows even critical journalists to attend city events in the interests of promoting democracy ; the attitude of The Loerie Awards to Herman Manson is an echo of Jimmy Manyi 's attitude to the media . <p> 4 . This is not merely an issue of a " good journalist " and a private company not seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of censorship and the restriction of media freedom . <p> Our response is as follows : <p> 1 . Manson has not been " banned " from the Loeries . His freedoms have not been limited ; he is free to say whatever he likes about the awards . He is not being censored in any way . Manson has media accreditation for the judge 's seminars and access to all information on the winners as soon as they are announced . <p> He will have access to all the information he needs to report on the winners and there is nothing to stop him from writing , again , as he did in his report on last year 's event : " For many , it will come as a relief to no longer be held hostage by award success as the sole arbiter of agency and industry respect . " ( Which was news to us , since we 've never been aware of industry respect being held " hostage " by anyone , least of all us . ) <p> In actual fact , Manson has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year and has not written anything about our programme . He has not written on the Travelling Exhibition ; he has not written on our scholarship programme in which we find talented scholars from a disadvantaged background and offer them a full scholarship including fees , living expenses , travel allowance , mentorship , internship , and employment within the creative industry on completion of their studies . He has mentioned the Loeries twice this year on his blog : the first time to note the creative theme of this year 's awards ( " Exercise your right to creative freedom " ) and the second to complain about the media accreditation that he has received . <p> 2 . Does The Loerie Awards need to ' protect ' its image by not giving Herman Manson free tickets to the awards evenings ? Let 's consider a few facts . <p> In 2011 , The Loerie Awards hosted 113 accredited members of the media , including 40 trade media . According to Newsclip , we generated R36 million worth of equivalent advertising value , a 58% increase over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote on his own blog , Mark Lives : " There are but a handful of journalists in South Africa covering the advertising beat . You can probably count them on two hands . " This means he 'll actually need eight hands to count them all . ) <p> So it 's safe to say that we do n't need to ' protect ' our image . In fact , if we 'd wanted to ' protect ' our image from Manson , the easiest way to do so would have been to give him tickets and leave it at that . The decision to give Manson accreditation for the Loeries seminar and full access to the media database , while not providing access to the awards ceremonies , was based on his limited coverage of the Loeries in the past as well as his proposed limited coverage for this event . Manson himself wrote on his media application : " I intend covering the Loeries seminar . There will also be a post-Loreie sic event story . Winners follow up depending on winning work . " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Not everyone who applies for accreditation gets tickets to the awards evenings , which are in very high demand . Last year we had a waiting list of over 200 people wanting tickets . <p> 3 . The comparison of The Loerie Awards , a private company , to the City of Cape Town , which is accountable to ratepayers and citizens , is completely spurious . As we 've made clear , Manson has not been denied access to the information he requires in order to report on the awards -- that is , the judge 's seminar and a detailed list of winners . <p> In fact it is common practice for organisations not to invite everyone in the media to a gala dinner or awards evening , particularly not one where tickets are as in demand as they are for the Loeries . Motor vehicle manufacturers or cellphone brands do not accredit every single member of the media who wants to come to the launch of a new model . Does this mean that bloggers who want to go and see a new car but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Then there is the ridiculous comparison of The Loerie Awards to Jimmy Manyi , who threatened to withdraw government advertising amidst the threat of a media tribunal as well as the Protection of State Information Bill . To suggest that Manson 's freedoms are being restricted because he did n't get free tickets to attend an awards evening is an insult to all of those journalists who could face jail time because they report on information the government does n't want you to know . <p> 4 . In his own response to the matter , Manson has suggested that The Loerie Awards is using awards evening tickets to censor journalists : <p> " The Board of The Loeries , the Creative Circle and Mr Human need to dispel any notion that media accreditation depends on journalists towing sic the organisational line and writing sunshine journalism . Failure to do so creates pressure on journalists to censor themselves , and leaves accredited journalists in an untenable position which renders anything they write suspect , through no action of their own . " <p> Could we have a bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reports around the Loeries last year dealt with David Hasselhoff ( one of two MCs , along with Riaan Cruywagen ) and the work that won the awards . Not corruption , as is the case with all too many other media stories . Not mismanagement . Not incompetence ; the responses in the media to Loeries 2011 , included , " Unbelievable Loeries sizzle , " in the New Age ; " The Hoff rocks the Loeries , " in Heat magazine ; " Loeries nou op nuwe vlak , " in Beeld ; " Birds of a feather flocked together for a fabulous , fast paced Loerie weekend , " in the Saturday Star ; " The new format for the presentation evenings was an undoubted success , " in Finweek ; and ACA CEO Odette van der Haar commented , " best Loeries ever . " Amongst all this positive reporting , Manson 's post-event coverage made no mention whatsoever of the actual award ceremony and only covered the winning work -- which his accreditation enables him to do again this year . <p> In fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local economy according to calculations by Professor Kamilla Swart , with a very small team of extremely hard-working people . We exist primarily to improve standards of South African creativity in brand communication . In July this year , Fast Company reported that there was solid evidence from Coca-Cola and other brands that award-winning communication sells more product , so it 's in the national interest to promote better creative performance . So while The Loerie Awards is about celebrating creativity , we have an important economic role to play too . <p> De Waal and Manson are free to write whatever they like about the advertising industry in general and The Loerie Awards in particular . But the fact remains that a biased opinion piece -- which happened to run on an influential media platform with a reputation for insightful reporting -- is now being confused elsewhere as fact . In the process , this has created an inaccurate and unfair perception of a well-run and much admired event devoted to celebrating creativity in a country that , more than ever , needs new and better ideas . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to comment on articles .

Now consider that this was a game made in 1994 . <p> X-COM still stands today as one of the best strategy games ever made and nothing else has quite matched its formula , but it looks like XCOM : Enemy Unknown might . I hope it does . If anyone can do the original game justice , it 's Firaxis , and despite the times we live in , to their credit they 've gone and made the game properly turn-based and , from the 40 minutes I played , completely awesome . <p> The back-story to XCOM : Enemy Unknown is very straightforward : An alien pod has landed and the aliens in it have killed the people that German troops have sent to investigate . The world has taken quick action and put together a group to combat the threat of the aliens -- XCOM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elite troops are sent in to see what has happened . <p> You command their every move and must carefully plan your approach to the landing site or your operatives will be killed . When you 've scoured the site and dispatched any hostiles in the turn-based , tactical battle you retrieve whatever you find and take it back to XCOM command , where you plan your next steps . This part is strategic -- decide what to research , what equipment to build , who to promote . <p> You never know when a new alien landing will happen , and when they do there might be more than one at once and you 'll have to choose which one to go to . This affects relations with countries and regions -- ignore their request and they 'll contribute less to your efforts . The combination of grand strategy and close-quarters tactical combat is very satisfying in the original UFO : Enemy Unknown , and it looks like it 's matched by XCOM : Enemy Unknown . <p> Another throwback to the early 90 's style of gaming is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things will happen very differently . In this way XCOM : Enemy Unknown is more akin to Civilization or Alpha Centauri than Fire Emblem or Ghost Recon : Shadow Wars , to name a few recent strategy RPG games .

Everything feels right . The turn-based combat involves meaningful decisions -- do I move twice as far or move and shoot ? Do I make small safe steps or rush in ? Should I try to get on top of a building to see more , but potentially expose myself ? Even though the battles are tactical there are strategic decisions to make within them in terms of approach , and before them in terms of who to send and what equipment to include in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of playing singleplayer or multiplayer . I chose singleplayer because XCOM has always been a very satisfying solo game and that 's how I expect to enjoy it , but there looks to be a very comprehensive multiplayer component included . It 's based on the squad-based battles and hinges on choosing your squad and its equipment . <p> Before a battle you are given 10 000 points to buy what you want to construct your squad . You can include soldiers or aliens , and all kinds of technology , although more powerful units will be more expensive and weaker against a team with lots of units because they will be able to flank you . The matches take about 20 minutes to play through and work in the same way as they do in the game -- turn-based on random maps . <p> How you adapt to the map and your opponent will determine your strength .

It also follows a string of XCOM games that have been released over the last 18 years that have been poor experiences , never quite capturing the brilliance of the first . Thankfully , this one is actually going to be released in October and it also looks incredibly faithful to the original . <p> It 's my most anticipated game at the moment and fans of strategy games should most definitely try it out . X-COM : Enemy Unknown is coming to PC , Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 on October 9th in the US and October 12th in Europe and the UK.

@@1130238 <p> Pashash , founded by two University of Cape Town graduates , wants to provide shoppers with a place to share their favourite finds -- from bargains to unusual trinkets to the latest fashions , while also letting them search the service for items they may be looking for in their area . <p> In addition to being one of only a handful of start-ups chosen by Google 's Umbono development programme -- which is how the start-up got its first batch of funding -- Pashash last week won the SA leg of the TNW Startup World competition . The founders will now get the chance to pitch their ideas at the global final of the competition in San Francisco early next year . <p> Cofounded by Faheem Kajee , 26 , and Lawrence Webley , 22 , Pashash shares similarities with services such as Pinterest and Fancy in that it 's designed to allow users to collect or curate items they like . <p> The difference is , rather than blog posts or images and other online content , Pashash allows users to " collect " physical , real-world items . <p> Users can take a picture of an item , tag it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found , add location information and share it to various social platforms , in addition to Pashash itself . Aside from creating a list of things a user likes , they can also look for great buys in their vicinity or search for specific items and see whether anyone in their network has recommendations . <p> Pashash launched an application for Apple devices in mid-August and Kajee says it 's really still in beta . " The first version of the app is pretty simple , with limited functionality , because we 're trying to develop it to match what people actually want rather than throwing in superfluous features , " Kajee says . <p> The biggest challenge facing Pashash is getting users to post more content . Kajee says this is far more important than pure user acquisition and feedback is being used to figure out a solution . <p> Though the initial funding came from Google 's Umbono start-up incubation programme , Kajee says Pashash is in the process of looking for a bridge round of funding . " We want to be able to have flexibility as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he says . <p> Pashash 's iPhone app <p> " We want to reward people for posting from stores and stores to reward us for that . Word-of-mouth and social recommendation are really valuable and there 's a lot of room for mutually beneficial arrangements with retailers . If , for example , a user sees a great pair of shoes at Woolworths and posts about it , we 'd like to see Woolworths giving that user a 5% discount voucher for their next purchase or something similar . " <p> Because it 's a shopping network , Kajee says Pashash has enormous potential to connect users with brands . " We gain insights into what people want to buy and can then target a user who 's looking to make a purchase , say a cup of coffee or a pair of jeans , by directing them to somewhere nearby that their friends or other users have recommended . <p> Though stores or brands ca n't create custom pages , they can create an account and post their own content to Pashash . <p> The application is available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kajee says an Android version will follow early next year . He says the service tried at first to develop for both platforms , but it wants to iron out the kinks on iOS properly before expanding it to Android . <p> Because the company is targeting an international audience , Kajee says there are no plans to create a BlackBerry application . " iPhone and Android are the most important because of our target audience . " <p> One of the advantages the application has is its ability to be picked up anywhere in the world . " It 's integrated with the Google Places database and can display items in local currency , " Kajee says . " It 's highly localised automatically . The next release will also convert measurements from imperial to metric where necessary . " <p> As for competitors , Kajee says users already share the sort of content Pashash wants to accumulate on other channels like Facebook , Twitter and , in the case of food and drink , Instagram . The challenge is getting them to share that content on Pashash instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " We think of ourselves as building a Pinterest for the great buys around you , " he says . " Pinterest is about curating online while we 're curating the real world . " <p> Though most of the posts to the service to date have been related to fashion or food , and the fact that it 's only available for iPhones means a limited user base or target audience , Kajee says a year from now he 'd like to see the service being used on a range of devices for everything from comparing prices on groceries to exclusive finds and unusual items . -- ( c ) 2012 NewsCentral Media <h> Why TechCentral ? <p> We know that as a prospective advertiser , you are spoilt for choice .

@@1130240 <h> Ssangyong 4x4 bakkie is good value <p> . Gone are the Picasso-esque designs and new Actyon is pleasantly attractive . <p> Ssangyong 's for some time been making pretty good bakkies and SUVs at a decent price , but what freaked out many prospective buyers was the strange and Picasso-esque styling of some of its vehicles , not to mention the brand nearly going bankrupt . <p> But things have been resolved on both counts , which should put Ssangyong on buyers ' radars once again as there 's real value for money to be had here . The Korean automaker has been bought by India 's Mahindra and is financially stable , while the designers no longer seem to be indulging in dodgy recreational pharmaceuticals . <p> The Actyon Sports double cab is the latest recipient of this Ssangyong 's more mainstream styling , and a major facelift ( including new grille , fenders and headlamps ) no longer makes it look like the phantom of the opera unmasked . <p> The interior 's also been freshened up with a classier look , and the audio system 's been upgraded with an MP3 player and Bluetooth compatibility . <p> At the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added to South Africa 's Actyon Sports range , but it felt rather gutless when we drove it at the recent media launch . <p> DIESEL A BETTER BET <p> A large , flat rear deck provides a 2.04-square metre load area , accessed via a tailgate that takes only half as much effort to as that of its predecessor .. <p> The turbodiesel model on test here is still a better option if you can afford its 320 grand pricetag . Though nearly 50 grand more than the petrol , the diesel has much gutsier outputs and also comes in a higher Deluxe spec with added comfort features like cruise control and a trip computer . <p> The power delivery of 114kW and 360Nm produced by the 2-litre four-cylinder diesel outmuscles most other bakkies of similar cubic capacity -- only the high-power Volkswagen Amarok beats it -- and some 2.5-litre diesels too , and delivers all the power you 'll need for easy cruising or towing ( it can pull a braked trailer of up to 2.3 tons ) . <p> There 's some turbo lag at lower revs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an appointment and in full throttle-attack mode , but drive normally and it feels more than adequately powered . Once past that initial lag , the engine pulls strong and smooth , and I enjoyed the slick action of the six-speed manual transmission . The sixth gear contributed to average fuel consumption being a decently economical 10.1 litres per 100km . <p> PROPER BUSHWHACKER <p> The Actyon Sports 4x4 is a proper donga-duelling bushwhacker for weekend warriors , with a high ground clearance , robust chassis , and selectable all-wheel drive with low range . <p> You can switch between two- and four-wheel drive on the move by simply twisting a knob on the dashboard ; there 's no second gear lever to manhandle . <p> Steering is adjustable only for height and not reach .. <p> The cargo area looks reasonably spacious and the tailgate opens with a convenient centre latch , but the load bay is covered by a brittle-looking ribbed plastic that does n't look like it will stand up well to the rigours of carting around garden rubble . There are internal tie-down hooks , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ssangyong 's bakkie has a very pleasant interior with trimmings that do n't come across at all as cheap and nasty . It 's definitely more of a family lifestyle vehicle than a workhorse , which is why it 's strange that the designers skimped on rear legroom so much . The back seat 's suitable only for young kiddies unless the front occupants squash their knees against the dash . <p> WELL-SPECCED <p> There 's no skimping on specs to arrive at this Ssangyong 's very competitive price however , where it retails for between 30 and 70 grand less than rivals like the Hilux , Isuzu KB , Amarok and Ranger . This top-of-the-range Actyon Sports comes with standard items including automatic aircon , remote central locking , electric windows and mirrors , 18 " mag wheels , a reverse parking sensor , cruise control , and an audio system with Bluetooth and MP3 and controls on the steering wheel . <p> Dual airbags , ABS brakes and electronic stability control take care of the safety aspect . <p> VERDICT <p> Selling for R319 995 and backed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Ssangyong Actyon Sports 4x4 Deluxe is pitched -- both in price and execution -- between cheapie Chinese bakkies like the GWM Steed , and stalwarts like the Hilux , Isuzu KB and Amarok . <p> The Actyon Sports is closer in execution to the stalwarts with its reasonably classy interior execution and it has a distinct power advantage over most rivals . <p> Now that the styling is n't inspired by Halloween it 's a much more palatable design and , apart from its cramped rear legroom , it makes a good value-for-money package . -Mercury Motoring <h> Comment Guidelines <p> Has a comment offended you ?

@@1131237 <p> Folding rear centre armrest supports the inside elbow at just the right <p> September 15 2012 at 04:14pm <p> By : Dave Abrahams <p> Tata 's first venture into the entry-level family sedan segment , the Indigo Manza - released this week in South Africa in two very aggressively priced variants - comes to the market from a different angle than its competitors . <p> The Toyota Etios , the VW Polo Vivo and the slightly more upmarket Ford Ikon sedan are true base models ; each is at the bottom of its maker 's price list , whereas the Indigo Manza is Tata 's flagship passenger car and thus carries different expectations . <p> The Manza is built on an entirely new platform , says Tata , with an overall length of 4413mm on a 2520mm wheelbase . Quoted width is 1.707 , which includes the side mirrors , because it looks and feels a little narrower - especially when viewed from directly behind , when it becomes obvious that at 1550mm the body is in fact almost as tall as it is wide , rather like an early Fiat Uno . <p> The styling is distinctive but not outrageous , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the window line across the top of the three-barrelled headlight units and down in a continuous curve to form the outer line of the grille . <p> There 's no firm delineation between bonnet and grille , which simplifies and coalesces the front treatment in a hard-won purity of line that 's instantly thrown away by one too many firm horizontal lines in the profile . <p> The rear deck is high , short and decisively chopped off , a design standard that began with the Alfa Giulietta of the 1970s and still looks right today . <p> In this case it also encapsulates a generous 460-litre boot , which can be extended by folding the one-piece rear seat back - at which point the Manza becomes a two-seater . <p> The range-topping Ignis derivative - the only one available to drive at the South African medie launch - runs on neat 15 " alloy rims , which draw attention to a design feature that emphasises the car 's third-world roots . <p> It has noticeably more ground clearance than its competitors - which means it will do well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large percentage of its target market lives . <p> The body exudes an aura of rubustness ; the doors require a firm push to shut , then do so with a solid ' thunk ' rather than a tinny ' clang ' ; the boot lid , frankly , needs to be slammed before the catch will hold - both of which could be ascribed to over-enthusiastic dust-sealing rubber trims . India , you will recall , is a very dusty place . <p> Fit and finish inside the car , unfortunately , is not quite up to the same standard . <p> Soft-touch material for the attractively curved fascia moulding lends a superficial air of opulence , but the fit of the plastic centre-stack insert is poor , the switchgear ( including the satellite controls on the steering wheel ) is plasticky and low-rent , and the mouldings around the steering column fit where they touch - which is n't very often . <p> Which is a pity , because the Manza is very well specced , with classically neat analogue speedometer and rev-counter in the driver 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bluetooth ) in the centre stack and a trip computer display , cleverly installed under an ' eyebrow ' in the fascia moulding that keeps it permanently shaded and easily legible . <p> The rev-counter has no red line ; instead , the white needle glows bright red just before the engine hits its power peak at 6000rpm , a stylish and eye-catching alternative . <p> By making the front seats , which are both adjustable ( over a somewhat limited range ) for height , rather more upright than Westerners are used to , Tata has gained an astonishing amount of rear legroom . Even with the front seats adjusted as far back as they will go , a 1.78m rear-seat passenger still has 50mm of clearance between is knees and the back of the front seats , and the high roof provides plenty of headroom for turbans , even on six-foot Sikhs . <p> The one-piece rear seat-back , is considerably more inclined , forcing rear passengers into a slightly awkward slouch until they discover a superbly padded folding rear centre armrest , complete with two neat cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right height for luxurious lolling . <p> The two-tone upholstery fabric is neat but not fancy ; if it retains that neatness over time , however , it will have earned its stripes . <p> NUTS AND BOLTS <p> The Manza is available at launch with only one engine option , the familiar 1368cc Safire petrol engine with multiport fuel-injection , built by Fiat in South America and sourced , complete with five-speed manual gearbox , via a Fiat/Tata industrial joint venture in India . <p> Derived from the proven 1.1-litre Fire engine that powered several million Unos , it 's tuned in this application for 66kW at a buzzy 6000rpm and 116Nm at 4750 . That mean it needs a footful of revs to go anywhere , putting it rather at odds with the Manza 's more conservative persona . <p> Nevertheless , Tata quotes 0-100km/h in 14 seconds and a top speed of 165km/h , allied to combined-cycle fuel consumption of 6.4 litres per 100km and CO2 emissions of 151g/km . While we were n't able to do any performance testing , we did return an average of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A 1248cc common-rail diesel , presumably also sourced from Fiat , is in the pipeline for later release . <p> With the exception of the of the crisp , positive gearbox , all the controls are overlight and lacking in feel ; the steering , in particular , exhibits all the worst characteristics of electromechanically assisted steering , with a distinct dead spot at the centre point and lack of precision at high speeds . <p> It had us wishing out loud on the launch drive for a return to the good old days of hydraulic power steering , so it 's a bit embarrassing to discover via the internet that the Manza in fact has a hydraulic set-up . <p> MAGIC CARPET RIDE <p> The Manza 's best feature , however , is its superb ride quality . During the launch drive in and around Cape Town , we took the Manza over the bumpy test section we use to evaluate motorcycle suspension . <p> Even at a steady 80km/h , the ride was serene , with no bumps , knocks , squeaks or rattles from body or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tones - which is more than can be said of some premium sedans costing six times as much as the Manza . <p> On the open road , cruising at 120-140km/h , the ride was a little choppier , but still better than expected from a car at this price level , while the cabin remained a quiet and comfortable place to relax and chat . <p> It must be said that one of the eight launch cars exhibited a nasty wind whistle on the left front door , but that could probably be adjusted out at the dealership by resetting the hinges . <p> BOTTOM LINE <p> Indigo Manza 1.4 Ini - R119 995 <p> Indigo Manza 1.4 Ignis - R134 995 <p> Tata 's flagship sedan does n't try to be anything it is n't ; it 's a spacious , comfortable , well-specced ( anti-lock braking and dual front airbags are standard ) family sedan of modest performance and somewhat variable quality levels , at a very tempting price . <p> Related Stories <h> Comment Guidelines <p> Has a comment offended you ?

Make sure you use clear , understandable language and remember to pay attention to punctuation , especially with regards to the correct use of commas and full stops . These two punctuation marks control the flow of your thoughts and if not used correctly , they can make your copy confusing , even if the words are clear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduction - create magic and interest up front and use your introduction to grab the judges ' interest right from the start . You might even consider completely changing your introduction after writing your body paragraphs . It is not necessary that your first sentence gives away the subject matter . Raise questions in the minds of the judges to entice them to read on . Appeal to their emotions to make them relate to your subject matter . <p> 3 . While spell-checking programs serve as a good writing tool , they should not be relied upon entirely to detect all mistakes . Regardless of the length of your short story or essay , read and review what you have written to ensure that all spelling mistakes have been corrected . If possible get someone to edit the story for you once you have checked . <p> 4 . Avoid long sentences and make sure that you get to the point without using unnecessary words or repeating the same things . Never start consecutive sentences with the same words . <p> 5 . Conclusions are critical - this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it takes to win this Creative Writing competition .

Marikana is telling us we have a way to go in achieving it . What needs to be done ? <p> Incidents like the Marikana massacre , as well as ongoing dissatisfaction in the mining , transport and agricultures sectors , provide opponents of capitalism with excellent ammunition in their quest to change the dominant economic model . Those who believe that capitalism offers South Africa the best chance to generate economic growth and , most importantly , jobs need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would argue , structural rather than systemic problems . <p> First , a little history . We should not forget just how hotly debated the future economic model for the fledgling South African democracy was in the late 1980s and early 1990s . Given the important role played by the Soviet Union and China in backing liberation movements , and the high position that communists in particular held in the African National Congress , it was surprising to many that capitalism emerged triumphant . One can speculate why that should have been -- the collapse of the Soviet Union and other communist regimes must have played a role -- but the important point is that capitalism , in South Africa at least , was very much on terms to deliver social benefits . <p> In short , then , classic free-market capitalism was never going to be acceptable . <p> The devil , as they say , is in the details . Corporate South Africa has spent the intervening years wrestling with the precise type of model by which it should govern itself -- and deliver the social benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Speaking broadly , two forms of capitalism were contenders : enlightened shareholder capitalism , and inclusive stakeholder capitalism . <p> Enlightened shareholder capitalism advocated running the company for the benefit of its shareholders , as in classic capitalism , but it considered the interests of other stakeholders in so far as they affected shareholder value . Whatever its shortcomings , this model nonetheless acknowledged that companies make an impact on a wide range of stakeholders , and that this social impact could influence ( positively or negatively ) the value that the company generates for its shareholders . <p> When all is said and done , this is really enlightened self-interest rather than enlightenment pure and simple , and does not imply any moral imperative to consider wider stakeholder interests . <p> A more appropriate capitalist model ? <p> By contrast , inclusive stakeholder capitalism situates the company within a social , economic and environmental context , demanding it be governed in the best long-term interest of the company by giving due consideration to the interests of all its stakeholders . Of course , there is a core of enlightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is premised on the understanding that a company 's profitability is ultimately tied up to its stewardship of its people , the environment and the society in which it operates . But this model goes well beyond mere self-interest , and confers on the wider group of stakeholders a right to have its legitimate expectations taken into account . <p> As we all know , the inclusive stakeholder model is one that was eventually adopted , largely through the governance models developed by the three King Reports . By the time of King III , in fact , the principle of stakeholder engagement had led to Principle 1.2 , which argues that a company should be a " responsible corporate citizen " , and that it stands in a relationship of ethical responsibility to the society in which it operates . This principle resonates with the requirement in the new Companies Act for a social and ethics committee that would ensure that the company considers the impact it has on a range of internal and external stakeholders . <p> So far so good , but not far enough . King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond narrow shareholder interests , but they fall short of creating formal structures in which the voices of wider stakeholder groups can be heard . The social and ethics committee remains purely a board committee , and thus the engagement with stakeholders remains at the behest of the same narrow group of players , the elected representatives of shareholders who serve as non-executive directors on the board and the executive management of the company . <p> No matter how effective a company 's engagement with its stakeholders is , or how sincere , this structure denies the stakeholders the right to a voice within the company and must , of necessity , constrain communication . <p> The challenges that South Africa faces are so complex and pressing as to make multi-stakeholder forums an absolute necessity . Such forums exist at the national and industry levels in the guise of Nedlac and collective bargaining councils respectively , but they do not exist at the company level . <p> We have had some lost opportunities . During the hearings on the Companies Act , it was suggested that labour should have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Similarly , the first draft of the act and regulations provided for an advisory panel that had multi-stakeholder representation , but again the proposal was dropped . The social and ethics committee -- consisting of non-executive and executive directors -- was the compromise . <p> Time to make a change <p> To anyone who has followed the news around Marikana , it should be readily apparent that workers feel excluded from the running of the company . This sense of exclusion has , of course , historical roots and is not solved by the periodic wage negotiations conducted on workers ' behalves by unions . Important as these mechanisms are , they are simply too removed from the coal face , shop floor , and ultimately the boardroom . The situation is complicated by the indisputable fact that the unions themselves are running the risk of losing touch with workers as they involve themselves more and more in national politics . <p> For all of these reasons , and in order to provide a workable solution to the challenges companies face , I want to argue that we need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between individual companies and their stakeholders . <p> My suggestion is not as radical as it might , at first , seem . Such formal mechanisms do exist ( and have proved useful ) elsewhere in the world . The examples of Germany and Japan come to mind . In both these countries , workers have a voice within the governing structures of companies . <p> Nationalising mines and land has been proven time and again not to work , but calls for this to happen are becoming not only more strident but more persuasive in the national debate . We already have a highly advanced system of corporate governance , and one that is already explicitly based on a value system that includes wide corporate responsibility . What we now need to do is create the formal structures at company level to make stakeholder engagement an integral part of the way companies are governed .

In the next scene , Mr Orange ( Tim Roth ) is bleeding from a gut wound as Mr White ( Harvey Keitel ) rushes him to a rendezvous with the rest of the crew . <p> From there , things just get more screwed up as the film zigzags between past and present to show how the gang members are recruited for a diamond heist and what happens to each of them when it all goes wrong .

And the film 's outspoken , enthusiastic director -- a bit like Popeye on amphetamines -- was born to be a star . <p> Asked to justify the violence , Tarantino goaded his critics : " I do n't know about you , but I love violent movies . What I find offensive is that Merchant-Ivory shit . " Welcome to what Biskind calls the new brutalism -- at that time , a welcome counterpoint to the dull worthiness of the American independent scene . <p> Tarantino initially planned to fund the film from US$30 000 he raised from selling the script for True Romance , which was filmed by the late Tony Scott . When Keitel came on board as an actor and co-producer , Tarantino was able to boost his funding to a modest but more manageable $1,5m . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filmmaking . <p> The cocky and casual saunter that influenced every shot of a bunch of guys walking for years to come <p> The film made do with simple sets and props ; the iconic black suits and skinny ties the gangsters wear were donated by a designer with a fondness for hardboiled movies . The production values did not matter because of the strength of Tarantino 's writing , his dialogue recalling the macho profanity of David Mamet ( one critic called it " Glengarry Glen Ross with guns " ) and the hardboiled patois of Elmore Leonard . <p> Reservoir Dogs is an art movie that is also a genre film -- both a shrewd deconstruction and a reverent celebration of the heist movie . " Dogs is an anti-art film art film , a canny amalgam of outsider and insider art , " writes Biskind . " If the New Wave gallicised Hollywood B-movies , Tarantino re-Americanised the French hybrids , reclaiming them as it were . " <p> Reservoir Dogs had its antecedents -- the pop-culture subversions of David Lynch ; the inter-textual cinematic collages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phil Collins between the graphic murders in his novel American Psycho -- but it had an incomparable sheen of nouvelle vague cool . <p> Tarantino liked to say that he went to " films " rather than " film school " , devouring and ingesting everything on the shelves of the Los Angeles video store where he was a clerk . Where the New Hollywood directors like Martin Scorsese and Brian De Palma idolised Orson Welles and the French New Wave , Tarantino was a connoisseur of low culture . <p> For Tarantino , Bruce Lee 's Enter the Dragon was as worthy of adoration as Jean-Luc Godard 's Breathless . In addition to Hong Kong chop socky , grindhouse flicks and spaghetti Westerns , he also loved bubble-gum pop , comic books and hardboiled detective stories . With the eye of a magpie , Tarantino picked out the shiniest pieces in the trash to make his movies . <p> Reservoir Dogs was shameless in how it plundered other films for shots , motifs , characters and plot points : here a piece from The Killing , there a slice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jungle and Ocean 's 11 . The Taking of Pelham 1-2-3 gave Tarantino the idea to give his characters colour-coded names , while the 1980s Hong Kong crime epic City on Fire inspired the undercover cop and the bloody Mexican stand-off at the end of the film . <p> The way Tarantino assembled the component parts , however , was exhilarating and witty . Like the good poets in the TS Eliot essay that spawned the maxim " immature poets imitate ; mature poets steal " , Tarantino welded his thefts into a new whole that was " unique , utterly different from that from which it was torn " . Like the bug-eyed Mr Pink ( Steve Buscemi ) , Tarantino is the guy who hotfoots it with the diamonds . Unlike Mr Pink , Tarantino makes a clean getaway . <p> Mr Pink ( Steve Buscemi ) and Mr White ( Harvey Keitel ) come to blows <p> Unlike most heist films , Dogs shows little of the planning of the heist and nothing of the robbery itself . Dogs occupies the prosaic spaces between what most films @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incident in the parts of the story that most films in the genre skip . Its characters , too , are unforgettable , and brought to vivid life by an ensemble cast . <p> Though Reservoir Dogs made a return on its modest budget , it was n't a smash hit at the time it was released . Most people would only see the film after Tarantino broke down the doors to the mainstream with Pulp Fiction in 1994 . But its impact was immediate and disproportionate to its box-office take . <p> For starters , it gave Keitel 's career a turbo boost , allowing him at last to escape the shadow of Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese . Keitel was the first but not the last fading star to get renewed shine from a Tarantino movie . Dogs also cemented the relationship between Bob and Harvey Weinstein and Tarantino . <p> The film did n't much make much money for the Weinsteins ' Miramax -- that would come later with Pulp Fiction -- but it positioned Miramax as a distributor and boutique studio right on the cutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason that Miramax became known as the firm that Quentin built . <p> What really matters , though , is the film 's influence on other filmmakers . It was said of the Velvet Underground 's debut album that it only sold 1 000 copies , but each person who bought it formed a band . Within four years of the release of Dogs , it felt like everyone who had seen the film had made a movie . <p> There were some worthy heirs -- like Bryan Singer 's The Usual Suspects and Guy Ritchie 's Lock , Stock and Two Smoking Barrels ; a few competent ones -- Things to Do in Denver When You 're Dead ; and many awful copies -- Two Days in the Valley , Truth or Consequence NM , Killing Zoe , Love &amp; a .45 . Today , it 's hard to find a crime or noir film that does n't feel at least a little influenced by Dogs . <p> Dogs stills stands up fairly well now , even if Tarantino quickly surpassed it with Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value . It is a little raw in places , but also smart and confident . The dialogue still crackles and burns , the film moves at a brisk pace , and the camerawork is clever without being showy . <p> Tarantino may occasionally mock his critics by proclaiming a philistine 's love for cinematic violence , but there 's a moral core and aesthetic sense to his films that subverts his claims of nihilism . Dogs is , at its heart , a lamentation for the loss of integrity , heroism , competence , honour among thieves . And it has a sense of humour that sets it apart from its nastier , shallower copies . <p> The violence , though shocking at the time , is not gratuitous in the same way as it is in many of the films that followed Dogs . Re-watching Dogs to write this article , I still winced during the ear slicing scene , but noticed that you do n't actually see the act . The camera discretely pans to a warehouse wall inscribed with the graffiti " Watch your head " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end is that of the fatherly Mr White cradling the dying Mr Orange , his face wracked with pain upon hearing that the kid he stuck his neck out for is an undercover cop .

The consent of the appointee was not a prerequisite for appointment and although shareholders agreements that conferred a right of appointment were enforceable , such agreements only bound shareholders to vote for the appointee . A shareholder could not appoint a director . <p> The 2008 Companies Act permits the appointment of a director to the board without the need for an election by the shareholders in three circumstances : <p> At the instance of a person ( any person ) named in the Memorandum of Incorporation ( MOI ) if the MOI so allows . <p> Ex officio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MOI states is one that carries with it appointment to the board of directors . <p> If the MOI allows the board of directors to fill a casual vacancy in any of the above . <p> The power to appoint a director under the 2008 Companies Act is , in the case of profit companies that are not state-owned , subject to the proviso that not less than half of the directors and alternate directors must be elected by the shareholders . Thus , with the exception of an appointment to fill a casual vacancy amongst the elected directors , the power to appoint is limited to 50% of the board of directors of those companies . <p> Interestingly the 2008 Companies Act does not prevent shareholders from agreeing to vote for each other 's so-called appointees . Our courts have held that these contracts are enforceable under the 1973 Companies Act . As there is nothing in the 2008 Act that prohibits shareholders from agreeing how they will vote it seems that such agreements will still be enforceable . <h> Appointment <p> The MOI of any company may give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That person need not be a shareholder or even have any connection to the company . Section 66(4) allows the MOI to gift the power to make an appointment to any person . Person is defined widely to include a juristic person . <p> It does not seem that the person entitled to exercise this power owes a fiduciary duty to the company under the 2008 Companies Act . Nor does there seem to be any provision in the 2008 Companies Act that prohibits vesting this power in a person who is disqualified from serving on the board of directors of a company . The position of an officer as it was understood under the 1973 Companies Act no longer exists . Gone , too , is the very wide interpretation of that term to include so-called " shadow directors " . Persons entitled to a right of appointment under the MOI are not prescribed officers even though they may control up to 50% of the board of a company or , in the case of a state-owned company , the entire board . This is because the definition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the company exercise general executive control over the whole or a significant portion of its business . Persons entitled to a right of appointment under the MOI do not exercise this power within the company . This was probably done deliberately . It is unlikely that any minister empowered to appoint the board of a state-owned company would want to take on the fiduciary duties that could accompany the overzealous exercise of that power . The unfortunate consequence is that it is again possible to appoint what are really sham directors , enabling the real power to direct the company to hide behind what , on the face of it , is the legitimate veil created by the statutory right of appointment . <h> Ex Officio Directors <p> The concept of an ex officio director is one of the more interesting innovations of the 2008 Companies Act . Section 66(4) states that a company 's MOI may provide for a person to be an ex officio director of the company as a consequence of that person holding some other office , title , designation or similar status . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be a member of the board of directors of the company . The office does not have to one of employment . Any office is sufficient . It may be the general secretary of a trade union , the head of a political party or even a member of a family . The person holding that office or enjoying that status automatically becomes a director on assuming the designated position provided of course that he or she delivers his or her written consent referred to in section 66(7) . Likewise the appointment of an ex officio director terminates when he or she ceases to hold that position . <p> What makes these appoints unusual are the provisions of section 66(5) ( b ) , which state that an ex officio director : <p> has all the - <p> powers and functions of any other director of the company , except to the extent that the company 's Memorandum of Incorporation restricts the powers , functions or duties of an ex officio director ; and <p> duties , and is subject to all of the liabilities , of any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at least on the face of it , to deny ex officio directors a right to vote , leaving them with a consultative rather than a directory role on the board . This will significantly reduce the exposure of such directors to the liability that ordinarily reposes in directors of the board in respect of the matters referred to in section 77(3) ( e ) . Such restrictions can not however operate to reduce an ex officio director 's appointment to a sham . <p> An ex officio director is a director properly so called and as such owes a fiduciary duty to the company . The refuge ordinarily available to an employee of following lawful instructions is not available to an ex officio director appointed on account of an office of employment . The fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the company is paramount with the result that such a director is legally bound to refuse any instruction that would involve a breach of his or her fiduciary duties . <h> Alternate Directors <p> The standard articles of association under the1973 CompaniesAct permitted a director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the board of directors . Shareholders could however provide for the election of alternate directors if they wished or dispense with them altogether . This regime has been carried over to the 2008 Companies Act where section 64(4) states that the MOI may provide for the appointment or election of alternate directors . The proviso , in the case of profit companies that are not state-owned , that at least 50% of the directors must be elected by the shareholders applies equally to alternate directors . <h> Casual Vacancies <p> The issue of casual vacancies under the old Act was dealt with in section 212 and the company 's articles . Section 212 gave the company the right to determine how casual vacancies were to be dealt with . The standard articles authorised directors to fill a casual vacancy but the articles could be amended to provide otherwise . Such appointments normally lasted until the next shareholders meeting . Companies were obliged to hold an annual general meeting at least every 15 months . <p> In terms of the 2008 Companies Act a casual vacancy in the office of : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new election . This election must take place at the next annual general meeting of the company or if its MOI does not provide for such a meeting within 6 months at a meeting of shareholders or by way of a poll of the shareholders conducted by way of a round-robin resolution in terms of section 60(3) ; <p> an appointed director can only be filled by a new appointment ; and <p> an ex officio director by the appointment of a successor to that office . <p> However unless the MOI provides otherwise the board of directors may appoint a person to fill a vacancy on a temporary basis pending an election . <p> The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter .

Presenting his Medium Term Budget Policy Statement in the National Assembly in Cape Town , Gordhan said the government would also spend R132-billion on health care next year , including funding for an improved diagnostic test for TB , additional allocations for the state 's HIV/Aids programme , and continued investment in hospitals and health infrastructure . A total of R136-billion would be spent in 2013/14 on social grants , road accident benefits , unemployment insurance and various social development and welfare services , with the number of social grant beneficiaries expected to rise to 17-million by 2015 . <h> Allocations to provinces <p> Of the R949-billion in total allocations for 2013/14 , 47% will go to national departments , 44% to the nine provinces - which are primarily responsible for the delivery of health and education services - and nine percent to local government .

Gordhan said changes to the provincial grant programmes over the next three years would include additional funds allocated to the comprehensive HIV and Aids grant to compensate for a reduction in donor funding and to allow for rising treatment numbers . Funds would also be added to the human settlements development grant for upgrading informal settlements . Added to this , spending on provincial roads will continue to increase and increased allocations will be made to the community library services grant . <h> Improving spending by provinces <p> Gordhan said South Africa 's provinces spent 98.7% or R368.3-billion of their adjusted budget of R373-billion in 2011/12 , while national departments spent 97.7% or R498.9-billion of their R510.9-billion adjusted appropriation .

@@1206238 <h> Government <h> SA targets corruption , overspending <p> 25 October 2012 The National Treasury is to introduce reforms aimed at developing a procurement system that prioritises value for money while strengthening the fight against corruption in South Africa . The reforms , to be led by a Chief Procurement Officer in the National Treasury , are among several initiatives announced by Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan on Thursday to reign in South Africa 's widening deficit and improve the impact of public spending in the country . Presenting his Medium Term Budget Policy Statement in the National Assembly in Cape Town , Gordhan said the Treasury had completed the preparatory work needed to set up the position of Chief Procurement Officer , drawing on international best practice , and that key appointments would be announced shortly . <h> Additional anti-corruption measures <p> The Treasury also plans to introduce safeguards , such as reviews by the Auditor-General and the Parliamentary standing committee on public accounts , for tenders above a certain amount . It also wants to assign authority and improve capacity within the Treasury to investigate the value for money associated with tenders , as well as to institute a series of detailed expenditure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of public finances . There is also a plan to strengthen South Africa 's anti-corruption system by providing additional resources to agencies such as the Office of the Public Protector , the Anti-Corruption Task Team and others , Gordhan told Parliament . <h> State spending <p> The government is expected to spend R1.06-trillion in the current financial year , rising to R1.1-trillion in 2013/14 , R1.2-trillion in 2014/15 and R1.3-trillion in 2015/16 . Of the government 's R1.1-trillion expenditure for 2012/13 , the bulk will be spent on health and social protection ( R246-billion ) and education ( R220-billion ) . The biggest rises in spending between 2012/13 and 2015/16 are in employment and social security ( 9.1% ) and local government and housing at nine percent . The government has decided not to make any upward adjustment of the spending projection set out in the 2012 Budget , tabled in February , over the next two years - namely in 2013/14 and 2014/15 . In preparing their medium-term plans - for spending over the next three years - departments have been required to reprioritise spending away from underperforming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next three years , the real growth in compensation of state employees would average 1.3% , while capital payments would grow at 4.3% , according to the Treasury . <h> Managing the public sector wage bill <p> Gordhan wants the government , in the coming years , to take a more deliberate approach to managing overall employment and wage trends across the public sector , including state-owned entities , in particular by curtailing unwarranted growth in personnel numbers . The wage agreement reached this year between the government and public sector unions was higher than projected in Gordhan 's 2012 Budget tabled in February , and will cost the R37.5-billion over the next three years . This will absorb a large portion of the allocations the National Treasury had made available through reprioritisation . To free up additional allocations , the National Treasury has also reprioritised R40-billion in funds , which , combined with drawdowns from the contingency reserve , will allow budget baselines to be revised without effecting an increase in government spending .

" <p> The effect of this amendment was that if nominations are not made on the same day of the sale ( i.e. by midnight on the same day of the sale ) , then the sale would attract double transfer duty . This amendment was primarily introduced to prevent people avoiding transfer duty through the use of nomination agreements . <p> The question however arises as to whether this restriction on nomination clauses is applicable to transactions that attract VAT . <p> The starting point is to note that the amendment was made to section 16 of the Transfer Duty Act and no similar provision or amendment was introduced into the Value Added Tax Act , 89 of 1991 ( the VAT Act ) . <p> Furthermore , the South African Receiver of Revenue Service ( SARS ) VAT Guide does not contain any reference to the amendment of clause 16 of the Transfer Duty Act which may substantiate the amendment 's applicability to the VAT Act . In addition to the above , the Explanatory Memorandum issued by SARS explaining the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duty Act does not make any reference to the VAT Act which would have been an indication that it was the legislature 's intention to make it applicable to VAT transactions . <p> As consequence it can be said that the section 16 amendment of the Transfer Duty Act has no applicability to the VAT Act , and as a result has no applicability to those transactions that fall within the ambit of the VAT Act ( as apposed to those transactions falling within the ambit of the Transfer Duty Act ) . <p> If therefore one is dealing with an agreement of sale that attracts VAT ( as opposed to Transfer Duty ) , then it could be said that the restriction that a nomination be made by midnight on the same day of the sale is not applicable and consequently parties are free to negotiate the period within which the purchaser is obliged to make his/her nomination .

@@1295237 <h> Underage drinking is getting out of hand <p> 12 December 2012 , 15:02 <p> It seems like as a society we are losing our moral compass when it comes to underage drinking . Peer pressure plays a fundamental part in influencing our teenage children , that 's true in all societies , but the ease with which they can participate in this pastime is alarming . It 's time we stood up together as a society and realise that we are sitting on a ticking time bomb . In England underage drinking has become a phenomenon that authorities have little control over . We certainly want to avoid going the same way as them . <p> In Durban one just has to visit any of the major centres such as Ballito or Umhlanga on a Friday or Saturday night to witness the size of the problem at hand . Underage children are to be found at most establishments . Girls as young as 13 are stumbling around the place often dressed in miniskirts . Gateway shopping centre is a magnet for underage girls and boys getting totally smashed . I witnessed children being allowed into an over 18 rave at the Wavehouse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blind eye . The bouncers never ask for I.D despite the centres conviction that they are strict on identification . I stood around for 20 minutes as a stream of young kids made their way into the event with not one of them being asked to present identification . <p> At other establishments they accept certified copies of identification which can easily be photo shopped . I honestly do n't believe that these establishments want to enforce the age restrictions though . These clubs in Ballito and Umhlanga and these huge events at Gateway are willing to turn a blind eye for the sake of profit . There is a restaurant in Umhlanga which is situated on the first level . They serve drinks to underage drinkers at tables on the ground floor . Their waiters make trips down the stairs to serve drinks to this target market . All the underage children know that this is where they can get drinks without being the legal age . The owners of these establishments have lost their moral compass and are conducting illegal activities . They are earning money from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drug dealer . The police should take a hard line with these establishments and attach their assets . This brings us to the next point . <p> Law enforcement in this country seems to have no interest in policing these establishments . In the past the police used to conduct raids on night clubs , arrest any underage drinkers and then charge the owners . It is evident that this no longer happens . How do we combat these establishments if the law is unwilling to take action ? The liquor board has an obligation to ensure that those that are issued their licenses are operating legally . It seems that law enforcement turns a blind eye and these businesses are free to conduct their businesses whichever way want , sadly to the detriment of our youth . <p> The part about underage drinking that hurts the most though is the behaviour of parents . I have a 15 year old daughter and most of the times when I hear of kids getting drunk the parents seem to condone these activities . Of course a lot of kids go under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases I have come across the parents allow their children free reign and are aware of their activities . I hear horror stories of other parents . Parents who smoke marijuana with their kids , parents who take cocaine in front of their kids , parents who buy their kids booze . There was an incident in Umhlanga recently where a 13 year old girl who had a fit because she drank too much alcohol and was diabetic . Her parents were horrified because she was sleeping at a friends and expected their daughter to be in good hands . When they took it up with the friend 's mother she said she had no problem with them going to clubs . She said her 13 year old had an older brother so she was used to going out to clubs . <p> Who is looking out for these kids ? Are parents that na ? ve to understand the damage that is being done . Come on ! You are destroying your children 's lives . Surely your love of your child and paternal instinct will want you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ core . Parents need to take responsibility for their children 's actions . When I counsel a child for drug addiction the parents always say they ca n't believe it 's happening to them . When I look deeper into the whole scenario it soon becomes apparent how little the parents are involved in their children 's lives . They are so busy with their own lives that children are just sent out to fend for themselves . They do n't have time to listen to their children 's needs . <p> This problem is so huge that only drastic action is going to make a difference . I only have experience with Umhlanga and Ballito but I am sure in other areas it is just as bad or worse . Drug and alcohol addiction is going to explode in the next generation . Raise the legal age limit for drinking to 21 . Let 's do whatever we have to do to keep our children safe .

And you 'd be right , because right now , there 's around two entire games worth of content there ... that has been cut . <p> Speaking to AusGamers , creative director Ken Levine cleared the air first about the new delay , which sets the game back a month , from a February release to March now , saying that it was unfortunately necessary . <p> " At the end of the day , it has to be great . So if it 's another 30 days , it 's another 30 days " Levine said . <p> I think the fans , at the end of the day , they want to play a game that is what the designers intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really sort of pay the price for it are the developers , because they have to keep working that much harder .

Especially if you 're a first-time game developer , and you look back at a game , you always think about the things you could have done in it . <p> But as for the rest of the development , Levine says that production began to drift a little too close to the original Bioshock , especially with the design of Songbird , the captor of Elizabeth that Booker is sent to liberate from the floating city of Columbia ; <p> Songbird looked much like a Big Daddy , specifically very much like a Big Daddy , with wings , and we realised we were staying in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's sort of a little bit of this makes a layer-by-layer hand gesture , where we do a little bit of work on the world , and that gives the storytellers ideas , then those story ideas give the world-builders ideas , and you go back and forth , and frankly , there were ideas that did n't work a lot of times ; so back to the drawing board . <p> I ca n't tell you how much of this game ... we probably cut two games worth of stuff out of the game , and I say that just in terms of content . Finishing and polishing is a whole other matter , but this is just the raw amount of content , we cut tonnes and tonnes of stuff , because it 's not an easy ... we did n't wake up one day and say ' Oh , yes .

Any of the content that I talked about , there 's nothing that we could pack together and ship . A , it 's cut for a reason : we did n't think it fit , and B , it 's left in a state that is completely ... there 's a term that we have called " rot " , in the games industry . <p> If you leave a level , or if you leave some code for a long time , and you do n't tend to it , other code evolves around it , and that code gets broken , effectively . <p> " It 's very much like rot .

@@1308230 Buyers make with Commercial Property Insurance <p> Commercial property owners in South Africa are increasingly making costly mistakes when taking out property insurance , often through being given the incorrect advice , or not knowing what to consider when they purchase a property . <p> Gary Palmer , CEO of Paragon Lending Solutions says although a number of clients know how to value property , they do n't always understand what insurance policy is best suited for their needs and often get the wrong advice . " The most common mistake buyers make is to under-insure , due to either being na ? ve to the risks that are involved , or they are sometimes given the wrong advice . " He explains that insuring a property incorrectly can lead to higher costs and potentially result in a significant financial loss . <p> Harry Casper , Director at Associated Insurance Brokers ( AIB ) Cape , the insurance partner of Paragon , agrees , stating that property advisors , banks and brokers , need to explain to buyers that they need to adequately value a property as soon as the purchase is completed . <p> " In some instances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the original bond value . However , the original purchase price can be significantly lower than the replacement value , especially while the property market is competitive with a number of good deals available . With that in mind , building insurance needs to meet the buildings replacement value . " Furthermore , Casper explains that standard insurance would typically cover damages to the ' bricks and mortar ' , but the replacement value needs to factored in to replace the asset at the present time , particularly when dealing with commercial property . " <p> " The replacement value can include fixtures and fittings , such as lifts , air-conditioning systems and paving to the common areas . Body corporate and sectional title buildings could include machinery and generators as part of the building . Being insured to the bond value , would result in exorbitant costs to the buyer for failing to insure correctly . " <p> Palmer and Casper both agree that buyers should consult with a professional property evaluator as soon as possible to determine the correct value before insuring . " The base value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the policy should include an escalation clause to increase the premium to keep abreast of inflation . Because buyers need additional assistance , " says Palmer . <p> Another mistake property buyers fail to consider is if the property is occupied or will be occupied by a tenant . " If the tenant 's business performs a high risk function , that function could result in a higher premium . Commercial property buyers need to evaluate what function the tenant will perform and if it results in a higher premium the tenant should be responsible for that increase with this stated in the lease , " Casper says . <p> In addition , the property owner should consider taking out rental insurance . " This will safeguard the owner from a loss of rent , should the property become damaged and requires the tenant to temporarily vacate the premises while it is being repaired . Liability cover should be included in the policy too but buyers must check that these extensions are in place . " <p> Palmer advises buyers to ensure they are getting the best premium and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reviews , clients can potentially save thousands , or tens of thousands of Rands , or even halve their monthly premium , even while providing them with additional coverage not previously included in their old policy . " <p> Casper explains that in one case a building was covered against Fire and Perils but this was not sufficient enough . " We covered Fire and Perils but expanded the policy to include Theft , Loss of Rent , Glass , Public Liability , Subsidence and Landslip and Accidental Damage . We further enhanced the business ' cover , at the same premium level , to cover the Office Contents , Stock , Fixtures and Fittings , Business Interruption , Accidental Damage , Public Liability - inclusive of Products Liability . " <p> Palmer says that brokers and property lenders should be in the position to adequately gauge what their clients ' needs are , and where possible , provide the buyer with the relevant assistance . " Property professionals work together as there are a number of factors that need to be considered when purchasing property . Industry professionals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where possible , advise them adequately and point them in the right direction when advice , finance , insurance solutions and valuations are required , " Palmer concludes .

Like many sons , he wants to emulate his father . But does David Beckham really want Romeo to believe that all you need to succeed in life are famous parents and an attractive face ? <p> Whether you like or despise the Beckhams , what 's undeniable is that they have made their fortunes not through family money or connections , but through a mixture of sheer determination and hard work . <p> The best thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to allow them to do the same . - Daily Mail <p> * Would you let a 10-year-old pose for a fashion shoot ?

@@1975231 <h> South Africa <h> R7bn worth of untapped township potential <p> Lessons from Spaza shop owners . <p> Kentse **26;177;TOOLONG December 2012&amp;nbsp10:42 <p> JOHANNESBURG -- In an industry that turns over more than R7bn annually , spaza shop township micro-entrepreneurs have a potential which can not be ignored . Emerging as micro-convenience stores during apartheid there are now an estimated 10 000 spaza-shops spread across South Africa according to the South African Cities Studies conference paper published in 2011 . <p> The Absa SME Index indicates that business ownership is on the rise but a majority of businesses in South Africa , two thirds , employ only one person . On average spaza shops employ between one and four people . The potential for sustainable job creation is evident . However , spaza shops exist in the informal economy meaning they exist outside of the institutional and regulatory frameworks . <p> Spaza shops range from survivalist endeavours to complete mini-supermarkets . Christo Botes , executive director at Business Partners says that the challenge with survivalist entrepreneurs is that they have no vision and often do not have the skills or training to move their business to the next level . <p> This is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ townships who are being forced to close down or are bought out by foreign spaza shop owners . The different approach to business adopted by foreign spaza shop owners has allowed them to compete against local spaza shops . <p> Foreign owned spaza shops purchase products in bulk or as cooperatives and sell at a lower price . Selling generic products , cheaper versions of popular brands , on special is also popular among foreign owned spaza shops . Sechaba Thinane , a shop owner in Thokoza , a township on the east rand , says that South African spaza shop owners are unable to do this because they lack a similar collaborative attitude . <p> Abdullah , a Somali shop owner in Thokoza says that understanding the purchasing patterns of customers is also important . " They do not buy in bulk , they buy little by little " and this is why Abdullah sells one teabag for 50 cents , sells eggs separately as well a single baby nappies . A range of other products are also sold this way . <p> Other Somali operated stores in Thokoza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers to purchase groceries on credit . Positioned next to or across locally owned stores foreign owned spaza shops have managed to out compete locally owned shops . <p> Thinane acknowledges that local store owners have been unable to respond to the competition . Local store owners have retaliated by forming committees trying to push out foreign owned spaza shops . This however , has not deterred owners . Abduallah who now owns two spaza shops in Thokoza says that he wants to grow them into a chain of supermarkets like Shoprite . <p> Thinane is optimistic however , he feels that local store owners can also be as competitive as foreign-owned spaza shops if locals can change their attitude to how they approach business . He says that his store has been in his family since 1958 and other stores have also been around for just as long . Thinane thinks this might have contributed to their lack of response as they thought they had a concrete position in the community . <p> Thinane plans to upgrade his store facilities and cater to a wider market by diversifying his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistance in doing this . Operating in the informal economy makes it challenging to access funding or receive any other kind of assistance . If store owners such as Abdullah and Thinane receive the assistance they need to grow their stores they could contribute to potentially 40 000 jobs in the townships . <p> However , Mike Sch ? ssler , an economist at Economists.co.za , the organisation that worked on the Absa SME Index says that the results of the research are important because they highlight that not everyone is looking for a hand-out . Assisting these businesses to convert to grow could contribute to changing this perception . 
@@1975232 <h> Related News <h> Related Club News <h> Osaze Odemwingie and his history with Nigerian football <p> A few days after I was named Super Eagles Media Officer , I messaged three players : Joseph Yobo , Vincent Enyeama and Osaze Odemwingie . <p> My intention was to let them know I 'd need their cooperation to build a bridge between the media and the squad . <p> In Osaze 's case , however , I added something extra . And in his joking reply , he promised me I would get my biggest headache from him . When the headache came , it turned out to be anything but a joke . <p> The first real crisis I had to manage involved none other than Mr Odemwingie himself . <p> I was sitting in a meeting at SuperSport when I got a message from a friend in Chicago asking if I 'd seen what Osaze was tweeting about then coach Samson Siasia . <p> The moment I saw the fiery tweets , I rang him up and asked him to take them down . He dug his heels in , but after a few minutes of back and forth , he relented . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been done . <p> And I spent the rest of my brief time in the post managing the Osaze/Siasia rift until it was finally settled in the latter 's final days as coach . <p> Osaze and I have come a long way . It 's been 10 years and counting . In that time , I have come to know the young man as a combustible fireball crackling underneath wooden floorboards . <p> Osaze Odemwingie does not do half measures . It is at once his greatest virtue , and his biggest frailty . <p> When he suits up in that green and white shirt , or any other for that matter , he leaves it all out on the pitch . When he calls someone out for not doing their job , he spares nothing . And when he is backed into a corner , he comes out swinging . <p> This latest , messy episode with Stephen Keshi is Osaze coming out guns blazing from inside of a corner , ten years in the making . <p> It is the culmination of years of frustration with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unhappy about . All catalogued in his initial tweets . <p> Being left out by Shuaibu Amodu for his first few games in charge despite a fine showing at the 2008 Nations Cup , only for him to speak out , get played and win multiple Man of the Match awards . <p> That was followed by getting into a tiff with Siaisa at the Olympic Games because he dared to complain about a shortage of kit ; then left out again by Lars Lagerback at the World Cup after being named Nigerian Player of the Year for his performances . <p> Odemwingie 's current scrap with Keshi dates back to a qualifying game in Rwanda , when the forward was first to be hauled off in what was a generally bad team performance . <p> From what he told me , the manner of the substitution left him with a sense of d ? j ? vu . And so he ignored attempts by the manager to make contact . On this occasion , I was involved , again , in brokering peace . <p> But with fences mended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ player 's commitment to the cause when he failed to turn up for the friendly against Venezuela in Miami . <p> Osaze himself offered little to me but to say he opted out for ' personal reasons ' . In any case , both Chelsea 's John Mikel Obi and Victor Moses did the same too . <p> Odemwingie had hopes of making the Nations Cup squad . He was a striker in form , had mended fences with his coach , had spoken to his team captain and was in regular communication with the coach . <p> Three days before the squad was announced , player and coach had been on the phone discussing schedules . <p> With the Odemwingies expecting their first baby , Keshi was not sure about the player 's focus and was giving no guarantees . <p> Osaze was willing to make adjustments to his schedule . That , unfortunately , did not seem to be enough . And there were rumblings of ' conditions ' attached to his return . Osaze denies it vehemently . <p> In the end , the decision was taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about his total commitment to the team . <p> Whether anyone likes it or not , the final decision on who makes a squad is up to the coach . Not the player , not the federation , not the fans , not the media . The coach . But , in making that decision , it is also in the coach 's unwritten job description to inform at the very least the senior members of his squad who have been axed . <p> It is a hard task to carry out under normal circumstances . It is even harder in situations like this . But that action defines the man manager . It is a sign of mutual respect . <p> This is where Odemwingie lost it . To find out in the media that he had not been considered for a 32-man squad was the final straw . <p> " For me , it was very disrespectful , " he told me . " I 'm packing my bags and done with the national team . But I needed to tell them my mind . " <p> As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call , I find it even harder to agree with Odemwingie 's route to self-immolation . <p> In his unbridled tirade , Odemwingie has swung at coaches past and present , his captain , the NFF , the media and even a section of the fans . Going off the reservation does n't even begin to describe it . <p> While we both agree that certain things needed to be said , his method , medium and timing has cost him more than just brownie points . He is reduced to looking like a petulant child throwing his toys out the pram because daddy said no . <p> The tragedy for me is that , just like Osaze 's fractious rift with Siasia , this could have been avoided . <p> And Osaze , for his full-blooded , decade-long service in the green white green , deserves better than to be remembered this way . <p> Unfortunately , I doubt this particular saga is anywhere close to running its course . Therein lies the bigger tragedy . <p> Editor Colin Udoh , thank you for what appears a clear-cut articulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I hope that everyone , the full range of the Super Eagles fan base , appreciates you . <p> But , let it be known that a certain legal jargon decrees that " no amount of advocacy can change the logic of solid facts . " This is to confirm that cases are won by the weight of facts tendered and nothing else . I will pick one or two lines from your submission to buttress my point . You told us that " The first real crisis I had to manage involved none other than Mr Odemwingie himself . I was sitting in a meeting at SuperSport when I got a message from a friend in Chicago asking if I 'd seen what Osaze was tweeting about then coach Samson Siasia . The moment I saw the fiery tweets , I rang him up and asked him to take them down . He dug his heels in , but after a few minutes of back and forth , he relented . By then , it was too late , the damage had been done . " <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is the father of all intransigence and indiscipline in contemporary Super Eagles . The actual reason Osaze was cut from Keshi 's AFCON team was the fear of CRISIS from a player who in one moment of madness would care less to swing at coaches past and present , his captain , the NFF , the media and even a section of the fans . Such behaviours from a player is capable of derailing the goals of the team at the AFCON . The Super Eagles deserve a much better serenity and concentration than that to prosecute a successful AFCON . <p> But , in all honesty are we going to slash Victor Moses and Ahmed Musa for him ? Or are we going to de-camp Ike Uche , Emmanuel Emenike and Brown Ideyen for him ? <p> We can now move on without Osaze although Nigeria owes him some gratitude for past services to the country . That , is non-negotiable . <p> " Knowledge is like onyx . One digs deep to have it .

But the most popular colour worldwide for vehicles still remains , by a vast majority , white or white pearl . <p> And South African motorists are no exception . <p> According to the 2012 DuPont Automotive Colour Popularity Report released this month , South Africa has the world 's highest market share of white and white pearl for colour preference of any region in the world . This colour represents more than 38% of the market share in the country . Silver follows with 20% market share and then black/black effect and grey follows with 13% each . It seems those South Africans who do want some colour in their lives opt for blue and red with 5% market share each . Brown/beige and yellow/gold have 2% each with green less than 1% and all the other available colours making up the remaining 2% . <p> Worldwide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from its second place by black . <p> The DuPont study , in its 60th year , is the longest running of its kind and includes the rankings and regional trends from 11 regions around the world -- including South Africa . <p> The top ten colours worldwide are : <p> 1 .

The colours " most associated with luxury goods through history " include jewel-like green , a pearlescent white and a bold bronze . The " fashionable individual who wants to be noticed " will lean towards an intense red solid colour , a dark teal and a pink metallic . <p> Currently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in North America , Europe and China , but low in India where the lighter colours are preferred . <p> Although some might label it frivolous there have been studies conducted into what the colour of your car says about you . One such study for Daewoo , done by Dr Peter Collett and Dr Peter Marsh , psychologists at Oxford , suggested that red cars signify passion , lust and someone who is full of life . They suggest this colour is usually preferred by extroverts who need high levels of stimulation . Silver signifies naked ambition . Wholesome , restful traditional men and women are more likely to go for cream and beige . Light or bright green could mean that you are bright and youthful . Light-blue is for introverts , yellow and gold for attention seekers and brown for the down-to-earth who do n't care about fashion .

In a British AA study conducted among its members it was highlighted that one of the attractions of a silver car is that people felt it was the easiest to keep clean , while silver and black was pointed out as colours that were perceived to increase the ease with which you will be able to sell your car .

Therefore it might just be prudent to opt for white rather than that electric orange you were planning on purchasing to show your individualistic side ...
