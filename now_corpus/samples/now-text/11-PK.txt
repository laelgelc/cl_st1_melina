And they weren ? t disappointed , as the band , despite the absence of Omran Shafique , delivered a stellar performance ; a veritable assault on the auditory senses of those in presence . <p> The performance was made all the more alluring due to the intimate nature of the venue ? the novel MAD School ? where the performance area has been tailored such that acoustics are not compromised &amp; echo is minimized . <p> The gig is part of the last leg of Co-Ven ? s tour to promote their third album , which was released recently . They got rave reviews for performances at a similar venue ? the Guitar School in Lahore , a sister concern of MAD school ? where classes are conducted for performing arts . <p> Pleasantly enough , the event started off a few minutes after the scheduled start , with Poor Rich Boy , a Lahore duo , playing their experimental brand of music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to follow . Poor Rich Boy with their lyric heavy music and an interesting range of sound go from mellow to heavy &amp; back . The small stories that each song contained gave a folksy feel to their music although they continued to jump genres ; starting off with the low-key ? Pythagoras ? and then having a thought provoking number with the title ? The Man I Love. ? <p> But the arrival of Co-Ven just lifted the tempo ten-fold and continued ? much thanks to the venue ? with percussionist Sikandar Mufti ? s crisp and clear sound having as strong an impact as Sameer on bass ; while Hamza vocals , according to one admirer ; were extremely emotive while there was a general positive consensus on his capability with the strings . <p> One complaint that was voiced , albeit with great reservations , was that the clarity in lyrics was compromised due to the smallness of the space . However , the pulsating music in itself was compensation enough , as the critic quickly agreed , to make the entire experience a riveting one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audibility of lyrics were compromised , as while being sparing , they did contain a pertinent message as well ; and were a very well thought out articulation and fusion of the whirlwind inside the individual and the external chaos that we see enfold us and are bombarded with . ?

Boundaries Broken ? among others had insights on societal functioning and the social morass along with being a direct appeal to the powers that be of the plight that we are confronted with . ? Ready To Die ? stood out as a lyrical amalgamation of breaking news and headlines that have become the forte of entertainment ; and it is this ability to use such material and present it in such a novel form that has also created a niche for Co-Ven and helped develop its reputation as one of the most progressive and conscientious bands on the local scene . <p> At this point , a word of praise for the venue which is a project of Nida Butt , of Mamma Mia and Chicago fame , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platform for upcoming artists as well as gigs by night . Nida Butt has been quite a force on the cultural front ; and while not yet to musicals what Sheema Kirmani is to classical dance , she is surely on her way . <p> The Guitar School in Lahore is a similar project and these two institutes are working in collaboration ; providing not training in the various performing arts to youngsters but also serving as an essential platform for aspiring artists to showcase their talent . And the d ? cor of the MAD school makes it stand apart from the usual institutes ; with its young tutors , graffiti art on the walls and the zest of youth that permeates the environment there invokes in one the desire to become one of those pebbles that will create the ripples to shake the dominant order . Long live chaos &amp; the MAD school ! <p> ?

As the climax of the Coen brothers ? 26-year-long , sidling , digression-filled crabwalk towards the pure , distilled essence of Hollywood classicism in their film-making ? which they first perfected in No Country For Old Men ? the final obstacle facing them was the western , the greatest of all American genres . And now , with True Grit ? which opened in the US last month to rapturous acclaim ? they have taken it , a genre oft-presumed deader than Custer and Crazy Horse , and given it back its heart , soul and teeth . <p> They ? ve been pawing the sand with their hooves before the western for most of their creative lives ; its forms and structures , its rites and rituals , and all its cultural and cinematic reverberations can be discerned throughout their work . No Country For Old Men is as surely a western as any movie set in 1980 can be , while their debut Blood Simple , nominally a neo-noir thriller , unfolds beneath searing Texas sunshine . Raising Arizona falls within that sub-genre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accommodates films like Junior Bonner , Urban Cowboy and Charley Varrick . Miller ? s Crossing has essentially the same plot as A Fistful Of Dollars ( which stole it from Kurosawa ? s Yojimbo , which nicked it in turn from Hammett ? s Red Harvest ) . <p> Having first read Charles Portis ? s 1968 novel as teenagers , the Coens were allied with it and not with Henry Hathaway ? s doddery , miscast 1969 version , in which a major role is essayed , ruinously , by Glen Campbell . The novel ? s appeal to the Coens is instantly evident : the voice of Miss Mattie Ross , the 14-year-old narrator , is innocent but plucky , and she ? s driven to remarkable feats of big-mouth sass and flat-out courage in the company of killers and vagabonds largely by her bedrock Protestant sanctimony and schoolmarm-ish rigidity . Portis ? s language is an archaic , biblically inflected 19th-century American English , free of contractions , a plainsong not averse to rhetorical filigree and curlicue ? a perfect fit for the hyper-literate , word-drunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There ? s no shortage of the elements we expect ? the note-perfect casting of every role and face ; the meticulous technical virtuosity ; the sheer joy of word and speech ; the fleeting moments of surreal oddness or psychic mania ? all except for the cynicism that marred their early work . Here are the Coens in their creative maturity and at their most respectful . <p> I ? m not about to claim they ? ve grown up . If past is prologue , they ? ll now make another second-rate comedy-duffer like Burn After Reading or Intolerable Cruelty , each of which succeeded a near-masterpiece . But with True Grit coming hard on the heels of the supremely assured ( and serious ) A Serious Man , dare I hope they are approaching a high plateau in their careers ? <p> StarBytesBrad Pitt to star in Lennon biopic <p> Because the Branges have not yet completed all the great works they were sent on Earth to do , they keep searching for the next mission that will enrich the lives of all those who inhabit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money to the African wildlife sanctuary and also why Angelina did Salt , because the story had depth and vision that was divine and everyone could learn a little something from it .

Brad wants to play John Lennon in a biopic , and Yoko Ono has agreed . That is what we hear at least , and no we are not spending our nights kneeling by our beds praying it isn ? t true ( yes we are ) .

Shasha will remain a crashing bore to the end of his days though , as that is something he can not help . <p> So according to sources , Shahid stepped on SRK ? s nerves recently by not turning up for rehearsals for an wards show , which they were supposed to host together , and SRK got his own back by not letting Shahid talk too much during the actual show . <p> ? Shahid did not come the previous night for the grand rehearsal and SRK was the only one to do it , ? says the source . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Shahid only arrived a couple of hours before the show was to start. ? <p> On the other hand , one of Shahid ? s supporters has spoken up in his defense . ? Shahid wanted to come for the grand rehearsals but he missed his flight from Chandigarh because of bad weather . So , he drove in the fog to Delhi , despite the unit members telling him not to , before taking a flight from there. ? <p> According to source number two , SRK was not ticked off with Shasha at all . ? SRK told Shahid to work on his individual act and that he will take care of their combined act , which is what happened. ? <p> Ranveer Singh is in demand after Band Baaja Baaraat <p> From all accounts , it appears that Band Baaja Baaraat ? s Ranveer Singh may well be the newest first-generation leading man to have arrived in Bollywood since Shah Rukh Khan , Akshay Kumar and John Abraham . Perhaps , it ? s a little premature to credit him with that much clout , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filmi connections carried a film on his shoulders like Ranveer has ? <p> Bollywood is understandably excited . Reportedly , the debutant is swamped with movie offers . More producers are likely to stick their necks out and attempt to make films with newcomers . But how many will put their money where their mouth is , and bet on a complete outsider ? Over the next three years , at least six male newcomers are expected to be launched . These include Varun Dhawan ( son of director David Dhawan ) , Arjun Kapoor ( son of producer Boney Kapoor ) , Saakshi Khanna ( son of Vinod Khanna ) , Tiger Shroff ( son of Jackie Shroff ) , Karan Deol ( son of Sunny Deol ) , and Rinzing Denzongpa ( son of Danny Denzongpa ) . <p> Some of these boys will inevitably show promise .

Every other Friday the public is subjected to yet another privileged star-kid clunking his way through some idiot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luv Sinha ( son of Shatrughan Sinha ) , Adhyayan Suman ( son of Shekhar Suman ) , Mimoh Chakraborty ( son of Mithun Chakraborty ) , Jackyy Bhagnani ( son of producer Vashu Bhagnani ) and Harman Baweja ( son of producer-director Harry Baweja ) , and you could tell they weren ? t cut out to be actors . And yet , every single one of them gets a second chance . <p> Then again , this is Bollywood , where Abhishek Bachchan has managed to notch up only 10 hits out of 34 major releases , in a career spanning 11 years ! 
@@4523232 <p> Note : This article is written keeping power webmasters in mind , having more than 10,000 visitors to their websites a day . <p> During past one week we , at ProPakistani , faced plenty of hosting issues . <p> We had downtimes ; and plenty of them actually , where I felt in middle of no-where to decide anything on hosting . All this happened even I had experience of managing servers for over two years . <p> Only an online entrepreneur can understand the pain of downtimes and when there are repeated ones , we desperately need an answer to this question : Which hosting company is best in this world ? <p> Before I answer to this question , we need to find out : What type of hosting do you really need ? <p> Type of hosting available are : <p> Shared Hosting <p> Unmanaged VPS <p> Unmanaged Dedicated Server <p> Unmanaged Cloud Computing <p> Managed VPS <p> Managed Dedicated Server <p> Managed Cloud Computing <p> Shared hosting is obviously out of question for big websites . Let 's look at other available options . <p> Unmanaged Hosting : <p> In unmanaged hosting , be it VPS , Dedicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with just operating system installed on it , not even apache , MySQL or PHP . You are at your own from here to get it configured the way you want . <p> You should go for unmanaged hosting only if you are system admin , and have good experience of managing web servers . Keep in mind that knowing PHP script , understanding what DNS is and knowing some linux commands does n't entitle you as a system admin . <p> You can never optimize a web-server in any case if you have n't worked with an ISP or an off-shore hosting firm . I agree that there are tutorials available for everything , but the thing is that a live network with proven experience ca n't beat the knowledge gained from tutorials . <p> Unmanaged hosting comes at lower costs but with a compromise on managing it yourself . <p> Managed Hosting : <p> In managed hosting , web host ( if it 's a good one ) is going to be responsible for all the odds happening to your online business . You can sleep tight and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the downtimes . <p> If you are pro blogger and want to put all your energies in your core-work , go for managed hosting . It may cost you some extra bucks -- but it gon na save you from pains of downtime . <p> Here 's a reason for why I would prefer managed hosting over unmanaged one : <p> As you may know , ProPakistani was hosted on SliceHost with an un-managed VPS . It was going all good , with zero second of downtime in two years , until one day ( in last week of December 2010 ) I upgraded my OS ( sudo aptitude full-upgrade ) . This command upgrades kernel files and all the applications installed on the server . <p> Upgrade caused a serious conflict between eAccelerator ( an acceleration engine ) and the Apache 's latest version ( web server ) . I was not a system admin and hence did n't knew of possible conflict earlier . <p> This conflict halted WP-Super-Cache to work properly , leaving nothing good but sudden spike in server load and ultimately the crashes every other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Athar , who was not available this time to un-install eAccelerator to make server work properly . <p> As it was an un-managed server , so web host could n't do much except for giving out some useful tips . <p> This one scenario , where you did nothing wrong but simply upgraded your kernel and applications through a prescribed manner , can end up ugly . <p> Here is a thing you need to understand : In managed hosting , your web host is not going to do anything -- until you ask them to do . You must tell them tasks until you are satisfied . <p> A good webhost will configure following things to optimize your managed server : <p> Tell them to optimize Apache , PHP and MySQL or any other application , specifically for the type of website you gon na host . For instance : a wordpress application has lots of Select Table query for MySQL as compared to Write Table queries . They will configure your MySQL accordingly for best performance . <p> They will disable un-used tools , mods and applications . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making your server DDoS , spam and hack proof . <p> Best thing I like about managed hosting is that host gon na reboot your server in case of any downtimes -- and this is done automatically . For the purpose they keep on checking the status of services , and if anything collapses server is rebooted automatically . <p> Cloud Computing : <p> Cloud computing is next level of hosting , which promises you the scalability on demand . For instance , you are running a news website which gets 500,000 hits a day . But on one good day , you break some news which gets top rank on google -- there are good chances for a traffic spike with 500,000 hits every minute , in this case cloud hosting is what you should go for . <p> The good thing about cloud computing is that you only pay for the amount of resources you use . For instance , you get 100,000 hits in a month -- then you will have to pay for the processing power and bandwidth used to serve 100,000 visitors . On other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- you will be charged 10 times of the previous month . <p> In simple words : Pay for services that have used . <p> Just as an example , the day Salman Taseer got killed , due to huge traffic Geo , Jang and Dawn websites went down but Express Tribune did n't . Reason : Geo , Jang and Dawn are hosted on dedicated servers which could n't hold the traffic spike , while Express Tribune is powered by Amazon 's EC2 cloud . <p> Issues with Cloud Hosting : You must keep this thing in mind that managing a cloud hosting is n't a piece of cake . You either get a managed cloud solution , or hire a company for shifting your website to cloud computing . <p> Recommendations , based on your Traffic : <p> Having said all this , here are my recommendations for VPS , Dedicated Server and Cloud -- based on your traffic : <p> 10,000 hits a day or less : Go for managed VPS with 1 GB ram <p> 10,000 hits a day or less : Go for unmanaged VPS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 30,000 hits a day : Go for managed hosting with 2 GB ram <p> More than 10,000 and less than 30,000 hits a day : Go for unmanaged hosting with 4 GB ram <p> More than 30,000 and less than 70,000 hits a day : Go for managed hosting with 4 GB ram , 8 GB ideal <p> More than 100,000 hits a day : Go for managed hosting with 16 GB ram <p> Go for Cloud computing if you want to get it all with a single solution . <p> Note : These recommendations are made for those getting traffic on hundreds of pages from search engines . Those with digg traffic , on a single page , can go for lesser RAM -- with wp-super-cache locked down . <p> Okay , now you must have known the answer of What Type of Hosting you need . It 's time to move to next question , what webhost should I go for ? <p> Selecting a Web Host <p> Now here 's the point : All webhosts are good as far as they are up . Webhosts are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of hardware failure . So check out their downtimes and hardware failure record . <p> Just to mention : if there is an application glitch on your particular server and your website goes down , this wo n't be credited to web host downtime . <p> Downtime : To check downtimes of a web host during previous couple of years , visit this website : http : **26;0;TOOLONG <p> Tools : If you are going for un-managed hosting , check out tools they are offering ( for free ) with the servers . These tools ( such as ISP manager in case of VPS.net ) can be very handy in controlling and maintaining your server . <p> Price : Probably the most important thing you need to consider before deciding your webhost . <p> Recommended Web Hosts : <p> Managed Hosting : WiredTree.com , KnownHost <p> Unmanaged hosting : Slicehost , Linode <p> Cloud : EC2 , Rackspace <p> This is it for now .

If you really think this then you are wrong . 99% web hosts are resellers from other US/UK based web hosting companies , either they are having vps either dedicated server . and for high price , this is because hosting industry in Pakistan is not mature , you will find cheapest host as well as expensive host there . New companies are cheap because they want to earn more customers , however old companies which already have good customer base and repute , they are charging high only for their good repute . <p> Cheerz : ) <p> http : //www.smashinglab.com Imran Yousaf <p> Aamir , you have shared a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone for us .

But Aamir what would you say if someone setup a Blog on WordPress.com and used their paid services , hosting etc I mean ? would it be better than going for a managed hosting ? for novices like me I mean . I am using serversea and so far it has been ok . But then I am just a newbie with no more than 100 visitors . Or should one start a website/blog and then shift over to better hosting/plan when he/she gets more visitors ? <p> admin <p> For those with less than 1,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shared hosting is good . As mentioned above , i will do a detailed guideline to best perform with your shared and wordpress hosting account . <p> http : //www.pallyweb.com Education News <p> article is nice for vps , but at the other hand you not told about shared hosting , , , i mean for low traffic website ca n't afford vps , so pleas tel about shared hosting and pleas tel that how much visitors will normal at shared hosting ..... <p> There are Low End VPS also available out there , Far better than Shared hostings . <p> http : //www.networkslink.com Ali <p> thanks 4 it <p> http : //www.nascentstuff.com/ ? p=90 Nauman Afzal <p> Thanks a lot , looking forward to the article Aamir . May I also suggest you include information like shared vs unlimited hosting plans ? Also if a certain hosting offers 5 TB transfer what would it translate in to in terms of hits per day under normal conditions . I understand there may be many variables in this scenario but that 's why I said under normal conditions sat 1000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hosting/traffic would it suffice for a high traffic blog/website ? Many thanks in advance <p> http : //www.webnsofts.com WebNsofts.com <p> There is nothing unlimited in hosting . Unlimited may means that you can use limited space out of available space , say if a server has 1TB drive , then you can use unlimited space out of this 1TB. 5TB transfer is alot , i really means alot , mostly when you get a dedicated server , it comes with less then 5TB transfer , so if a shared host is offering you 5TB bandwidth , then it does means he is not putting any limit to you out of his total transfer which is allowed for his server/vps . I have seen quite high traffic websites using only 10-15GB transfer a month . Unlimited space/traffic is not only required for high traffic website or blog , high traffic website/blogs also use high resources , like cpu , ram , and it depends on your host , how much resource it allow a website to use , even if your website is not using high space or traffic , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will refuse hosting to you . <p> http : //www.nafeessol.com Nafees Solutions <p> You are right , nothing is unlimited in the world . The web hosting companies that are offering unlimited hosting , not only one they are hosting 1000s of websites on a single server and all websites have a fake unlimited space and transfer . Suppose in 1TB server they host 1000 websites then divide the space to 1000 websites , it becomes 1GB per website . Those providing unlimited or too much space for hosting they are over selling their services , thus more downtimes . So do n't choose web host that are providing unlimited web hosting . <p> haider <p> yes my host also offered two unlimited packages for Greedy Peoples , but in there TOS it is Mentioned as Nafees told , Nothing Is Unlimited , <p> when i ask their Support they told me Mp3 , and other downloadable and streaming are not allowed on unlimited plans , and we try our best to make you Glorious . <p> http : //www.jahanzaib.info SEO Pakistan <p> Interesting Article ! but i am not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used it and had poor web experience so still you suggest as ideal option to take on <p> admin <p> We had a problem with our application . Yes , its not recommended for following reason . <p> -- You ca n't hard reboot your system yourself . You will have to open a ticket , which may take upto 30 mins in getting response . <p> Junaid <p> Aamir , you need yo focus more on this stuff on propakistani . <p> May I suggest that you clear up the term used as " hits " . Beginners wont know the difference between unique visitors/day or page hits/day . <p> Also WHT is a very good resource for web hosting related details , news and offers . <p> Rgds . <p> admin <p> Suggestion noted . As mentioned it was for pro masters , but agree that a beginner can read this too . <p> Will come up with more work in this area . <p> http : **28;61;TOOLONG behzad <p> i would still say , . blogspot.com is good for beginners till the time they have trned into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its affordable to you , then go with Dedicated hosting as it offers more security , reliability and performance . You will never have to worried of your hosting or backup solutions , everything is taken care by the hosting provider . <p> http : //www.nascentstuff.com/ Nauman Afzal <p> We are anxiously waiting for that piece for newbies from you ... : - ) <p> asjad <p> i liked ur article and the info u have discussed is very informative for me but it is also cofusing me a bit about vps cloud . i live in karachi n i have my reseller acount. there r server providers who provides the root acount which can do anything . the hosting is unlimited ( which cant be ) with 10tb atleast the space . the hosting provider says if u need more hosting we on your server wll add another 10tb drive . these are the local host around the world without a market name . so my question is that is this possible ? ? ? in front of me it is coz in pakistan we can get 1 tb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive or higher with cheap rates that wont effect the business and as they said hosting is unlimited can be coz they just ad another 10tb drive , so it can be possible ? ? ? real server real thing but managed ? ? ? ? cheap rates coz of not in the top ones .. i will be w8ing for continuing the topic <p> http : //www.askforhost.com Ahtsham Jutt <p> Hay Asjad Have you ever seen a hard drive with unlimited disk space ? Or Suppose a hosting provider rent a dedicated server for 300$/Month with 1TB Disk Space , he gon na allow you to use 1TB for 3 to 4$/Month ? No Never ! It is just a business strategy nothing more . Deceiving their clients . Most of EGI Brand Companies are offering such kind of Unlimited Disk Space like Ipage , fatcow , bluehost etc . Hostgator is the only company who is not EGI Brand but offering unlimited disk space , but remember there is nothing unlimited , so they limit your account with several limitations like number of concurrent connections/account , number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Blah Blah Blah ..... And The Most Important thing is , None of them gon na allow you to fill up Your Accounts with your personal data , with images , MP3 Songs , or other kind of files none-related web content files etc . So how you gon na fill up your Disk Space ? If you have 5GB Disk Space on a shared hosting account and running a wordpress blog , i bet you will never gon na fill up that 5GB in 5 Years with just WordPress Files . So always go for realistic plans . <p> asjad <p> and i have 100gb reseller that is not used only 1 gb i selled by me so i have 100 gb on my acount. i will try to fill out the whole space putting tones of mp3 after making my mp3 site and i will post the result here so u can continue the discussion . <p> Wow ! Today I got the right place to read which I was looking long time Really very informative and specially for for me who wants to start with NIL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the information I would like to ask U what shud I do means how to start with wordpress and next I still hv to gothrough ur complete information and hope to finish by tmrw Tks again <p> Very Interesting article Amir . I think you should write an article on these EGI Unlimited Hosting Brands too like bluehost , IPage , Fatcow who are deceiving customers . And interesting thing is , now a lot of hosting companies are following them and offering such kinda Unlimited things . 1 Thing more , <p> There is a thing I would like to mention Aamir bhai . Optimization is the key . I have been optimizing sites for more than 2 years now.I have seen sites with 8k traffic a day with execution time of 13 seconds only for PHP.The servers like Dedicated ones with even 10 GB rams are not enough for them . I have managed to get 5k per day traffic controlled on my blog , using a shared host , scoring 95/100 on Google Online Page Speed Tool . So , if someone has optimized site , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I ca n't agree more with you . <p> http : //freakify.com/ Ahmad Awais <p> Well , why you reverted back from the theme resign in early days ? I saw there were some changes but sooner than later they were gone . <p> http : //www.wpbeginner.com Syed Balkhi <p> If you do n't want to pay a crazy high monthly bill on dedicated servers , then its probably best to utilize a CDN to host your static content . <p> Your server load will significantly decrease . Plus , you pay as you go . <p> Somebody needs to tell this to Jang , Dawn , and Geo . I do n't know what anyone says , but I use HostGator to power my websites . Yes , now we are at a point where we are using their dedicated servers . But it would n't be possible to scale that without a CDN . <p> For instance , one day our site got hit on major social networks ( reddit , SU , pinterest , fb etc ) . We pushed over 4.5TB of bandwidth within hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would 've crashed . But CDN saved the day . <p> your site have still issue when i click on home page it shows me error " 400 Bad RequestIt is not a valid request !

The ability to nurture and present change in all its forms , intrinsically offering serenity in a world that isn ? t . <p> The culmination of a quarter century ? s work is collected in stylist Nabila ? s book Nabila Changes . The coffee table book is a collector ? s item for those who have known her and for those who can stand to learn from her . More than a book of pretty pictures it ? s a woman ? s journey against all norms to experience her life rather than just live it . An autobiographical account of Nabila ? s journey shows us a first person account of the woman that most people feel is an enigma . Within the pages of her book she manages to put herself into the open . Nabila is the only person that can do so with such ease and finesse . <p> Amongst her friends and well-wishers Nabila gathered everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an intimate evening , despite the camera crews . To be able to be at the epicenter of an industry which is eclipsed by egos and gossip , the support of one ? s peers is a welcome addition . Nabila signed copies for everyone after a speech by Imran Aslam . <p> The book itself is sponsored by L ? Oreal Professionnel which is divided into nine chapters titled I , Us , We , He , She , You , It ; along with a foreword by Project Consultant for the book and long time friend of the author , Zain Mustafa . The introduction encapsulates Nabila ? s first step into the journey that brought her where she is today , from her start at cutting her own hair to the empire that she runs and the brand that she has become . As an entrepreneur and stylist she always manages to out do herself and having no one to compete with doesn ? t make it any easier . <p> With photographs from the countries leading photographers - Abid Saleem , Arif Mahmood , Amean J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ et al - in collaboration with Nabila ? s astute aesthetic , it ? s a universe of beauty seen through her career that made the beauty industry in Pakistan what it is today . Nabila has become a brand name ? a single word reflection of beauty , power and independence . The pages are filled with the likes of Babra Sharif , Shaan , Hadiqa Kiyani , Wasim Akram as well as some of the most beautiful models in the country like Bibi , Zoella and Iraj ; strong personalities ( the only types that Nabila associates herself with ) and powerhouses in their own fields . <p> As an artist Nabila writes to the introduction to the chapter titled I , ? My medium of communication is hair . And whether my own or my model ? s , it has always spoken volumes about my life . Introverted , extroverted , held hostage to a desire to grow , to be free towards rebellion . To be seen , heard felt and taken seriously , my hair has always been my silent partner. ? Nabila is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and emerging reborn with greater understanding of the world that surrounds her and the world that she has bore . <p> It ? s time we took a page from Nabila ? s book and accept that ? change is the only constant ? . <p> ? Event photography by Faisal Farooqui <p> ForeignEditorialQueen ? s wedding advice to Prince William : Stop being ? trendy ? and start being ? realistic ? <p> Gina Serpe Eonline.com <p> Someone sure can put the curt in curtsy ! <p> We already revealed that Queen Elizabeth wasn ? t exactly ecstatic with the news that Prince William had failed to properly consult her before going public with their latest round of wedding details ( and gave Wills a bit of an earful as a result ) , but guess what ? <p> It didn ? t end there . So what else got Her Majesty to briefly break from decorum and give her grandson some free , if unsolicited , advice ? According to royal reporter Yvonne Yorke , the decision for Kate Middleton to arrive to Westminster Abbey by - gasp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carriage , was the just one of the issues that arose . <p> It was not long after the Queen brought up the question of transport that she also implored the king-to-be to be a little more discerning with his decision-making process , asking him , ? At what point do you stop being trendy and start being realistic ? ? <p> So what caused that question ? <p> While one can ? t know for sure , it certainly seems as if the tension caused by the high-profile wedding planning ? specifically , the parts of it that were done without requiring or seeking her approval ? had simply bubbled over . <p> And while Kate ? s carriage-free entrance into the Abbey may have been the detail that was called out , it doesn ? t appear to be the only aspect of the couple ? s nuptial plans that have put a strain on some royal nerves . <p> When Prince William first brought up the idea of a breakfast buffet at Buckingham Palace to his grandmother , the Queen said simply that she would consider the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good enough for the prince , as he later announced the reception news via Twitter . <p> Another point of issue between the royals is the later reception that will take place after the vow swap at Buckingham Palace . Hundreds of guests are expected to make their way to the Queen ? s home for a night of dinner and dancing hosted by Prince Charles , and this , per Yorke , also failed to get the go-ahead from the lady in residence . <p> The problem here , per Yorke , is that Buckingham Palace has only one kitchen which it uses for its most formal of occasions , which may pose logistical issues . <p> The breakfast , you see , is tentatively scheduled to end around 3:30 p.m. in the afternoon , and then there comes the clearing of dishes , the resetting of places , the cooking of multicourse meals and the arrival of hundreds of guests for the evening festivities , all within a matter of hours . It ? s the same reason why , in the past , dinner receptions have typically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that neither William , Kate nor Charles meant to intentionally disrupt the flow of the day ( or , by god , cause any amount of vexing to the Queen ) , but as none of them has the amount of experience in organizing such a massive do as Her Majesty , they may soon have to step aside . <p> The organization of Charles ? 2005 wedding to Camilla Parker-Bowles , for example , reportedly became so disorganized that the Queen stepped in at the last minute . To ensure that a similar level of franticness doesn ? t strike festivities this time around , the Queen has instructed one person from William ? s team at Clarence House ? his official London residence and the organization responsible for all official information on the Prince and his wedding ? be sent over to Buckingham Palace . <p> In other words , it looks like it will be the Queen , and not the future princess , who will be running the show . <p> ? I ? m not sure what William ? s reaction would be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When your Queen is speaking to you , you listen. ? <p> Welcome to the royal family , Kate <p> StarBytesAnything for Aamir Khan ... <p> Aamir Khan has decided he wants Kareena Kapoor opposite him in his next film , a thriller to be directed by Honeymoon Travels Pvt Ltd ? s Reema Kagti that he begins shooting next March . Kareena , understandably , is over the moon . But , as luck would have it , her diary ? s looking packed . Between now and June next year , Kareena is committed to completing three films . The first is Short Term Shaadi opposite Imran Khan ? a rom-com allegedly inspired by the Ashton Kutcher-Cameron Diaz starrer What Happens In Vegas ? that she begins filming later this month in Las Vegas . There are two final schedules of her boyfriend Saif Ali Khan ? s ambitious spy-thriller Agent Vinod . And there ? s also the Salman Khan action flick she recently signed , a remake of the Malayalam hit , Bodyguard . <p> With Aamir set to film his next from March onwards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? s going to squeeze that film into her choc-a-bloc diary . Rumour has it she ? s begged everyone from Karan Johar ( who ? s producing Short Term Shaadi ) and her beau Saif to good friend Salman Khan into postponing their shoot so she can accommodate Aamir ? s film , but she isn ? t having much luck . <p> Salman can ? t reschedule his shoot because his film ? s already been locked for an Eid release in August . Johar can ? t delay his schedule because Imran doesn ? t have dates later . And Saif ? s hands are tied because he ? s already hired a Hollywood stunt director to fly in to shoot his expensive action scenes on those dates . <p> The only solution seems double shifts . Kareena ? s reportedly volunteered to shoot the Salman film and Aamir ? s thriller simultaneously . But one hears Aamir wants Kareena to be committed exclusively to his film during that period . Friends have apparently advised Kareena not to be greedy , and to give up the Aamir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? s so keen to hang on to the project is because Aamir ? s second choice for the role is between Priyanka Chopra and Katrina Kaif ? both her arch rivals ! <p> Robert Pattinson replaces Colin Farrell in Cosmopolis <p> Has he become that big a star ? Even though Robert Pattinson has received way too much attention for his glittering vampire avatar ( way more than he deserves ) we can ? t get beyond the fact that Robert is Edward Cullen in Twilight . Of course he has done better roles and has shown his acting potential is more serious films , but we guess good luck can take you places . <p> Pattinson is going to star in a furistic action film , titled Cosmopolis , which as an adaptation of the novel by Don Delilo , and is to be directed by David Cronerberg .

Well then , he must be irritated with the fact that Hollywood newbie is replacing him in his dream project ? <p> ? It ? s a wonderful script . I wish him all the luck in the world with it. ? While the two actors have something in common ( their Irish roots and their way with the ladies ) they are still both poles apart .

While critics believe she should now choose age-appropriate roles , her fans seem to think otherwise . The buzz is that she has recently been offered to play the role of a mom , and the movie is based along the lines of Freaky Friday , the hit Lindsay Lohan-Jamie Lee Curtis starrer .

Ammara Farooq Malik is one such person , constantly on the go and searching for everyday pearls of wisdom by interacting with and helping others . <p> A graduate from Kinnaird College , Ammara is a young and energetic writer , social volunteer and teacher of law . Founder of SEPLAA ( Seeds of Education , Policy and Legal Awareness Association ) Foundation , Ammara leaves no stone unturned in her pursuit to strengthen communities . Recently , she adopted a school with more than 150 underprivileged children in Ghora Chowk Abadi , Lahore . The aim is to turn the school around . In fact , the SEPLAA Foundation wants to revamp the curriculum completely . The children at the school have mostly been child domestic workers at some stage and are described as very talented and eager . The concern is that they lack the proper guidance . The goal is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approaches to educate in a creative manner rather than focus on rote learning . Ethics and character building will be focused on too . <p> Monthly competitions are already in place at the school to motivate the students to excel .

The result is a programme in which privileged youth give opportunities to the underprivileged and promote charitable educational activities within the community . SEPLAA is in the process of adopting more schools under the same model . <p> Ammara describes herself as a workaholic by nature . She was , however , forced to adjust her lifestyle . Difficult times beset her and her family when her daughter fell ill and needed a bone marrow transplant . Ammara stayed at home to take care of her daughter .

She accumulated funds from friends and immediately launched an initiative . Without giving it a second thought , she galloped towards the flood victims with donations and a unique yet cost-effective " Recycled Water Bottles Campaign . " The campaign aimed to deliver as much clean water as possible to the flood affectees : no fewer than 6,000 bottles were distributed to remote rural areas of Sindh and Punjab . Students from different schools and universities were intensely cooperative in supporting this drive . In addition to this , SEPLAA conducted a mission to Muzaffargarh on August 28 , 2010 , and managed to distribute family packs to 1,000 families and about 100 goody bags with sweets and toys to children as well . <p> Given all the mistrust of the government and knowing many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ammara understands the critical need for transparency .

" Ammara takes initiative , " says Riaz . " She is a decision-maker and a motivator who grooms people to think constructively . " <p> Under her inspiring leadership , SEPLAA continues to grow by leaps and bounds . It plans to produce a global calendar of its events in different cities and countries and also to open a second functional office in the United Kingdom by the end of 2011 .

@@4531231 <h> US orders news blackout over crippled Nebraska Nuclear Plant : report <p> A shocking report prepared by Russias Federal Atomic Energy Agency ( FAAE ) on information provided to them by the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) states that the Obama regime has ordered a total and complete news blackout relating to any information regarding the near catastrophic meltdown of the Fort Calhoun Nuclear Power Plant located in Nebraska . According to this report , the Fort Calhoun Nuclear Plant suffered a catastrophic loss of cooling to one of its idle spent fuel rod pools on 7 June after this plant was deluged with water caused by the historic flooding of the Missouri River which resulted in a fire causing the Federal Aviation Agency ( FAA ) to issue a no-fly ban over the area . Located about 20 minutes outside downtown Omaha , the largest city in Nebraska , the Fort Calhoun Nuclear Plant is owned by Omaha Public Power District ( OPPD ) who on their website denies their plant is at a Level 4 emergency by stating : This terminology is not accurate , and is not how emergencies at nuclear power plants are classified .

Though this report confirms independent readings in the United States of negligible release of nuclear gasses related to this accident it warns that by the Obama regimes censoring of this event for political purposes it risks a serious blowback from the American public should they gain knowledge of this being hidden from them . Interesting to note about this event was the Nuclear Regulatory Commission ( NRC ) Chief , Gregory B.

Although the exercise is couched in serious rhetoric about preparedness , it relates to no specific threat and the details are nebulous to say the least and seems to revolve around little else than testing out high-tech surveillance equipment and reminding Americans who their bosses are .

" We placed special pots for water and the feed was also scattered at these places for the birds , but after some time we realised that our arrangements were no longer necessary as the public also started feeding the pigeons , " said Bhatti , current director of the Lahore Zoo . The patronage of the WLD ended soon but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passage of almost one decade , large flocks of pigeons come to China Chowk , Istanbul Chowk and Jain Mandir Chowk . The shops around these places also started selling grains for pigeons and people fed the birds considering it Sadqaa . A combined flight of the birds at being disturbed provides a splendid feast to eyes of passers by . National College of Arts ( NCA ) student Sara Faizan said : " I love the scene of pigeons ' pixel picking and their flight when the traffic signal opens . It is a great view and I think all the NCA students would have felt the artistic beauty in it . I have tried to paint the scene on canvas but I am not satisfied with this painting , I plan to paint it with more perfection .

They nest in human settlements , on domes , tall trees and old buildings . They are social enough to form flocks of small and large size in human surroundings depending upon the available food resources . Though the natural diet of pigeons is seeds and grains , they can easily learn to exploit a large variety of food including vegetables and processed items . Talking about their breeding , Bhatti said there was no hunting pressure on pigeons at sites in Lahore , neither did predator birds attack them , nor did they lack feed so their population increased considerably over the past few years . The Lahore Zoo director said stable pair bonds formed between birds which allowed them to breed for the whole year . The female pigeon normally lays two eggs and both parents share the incubation . Preferred nesting sites for laying eggs are dark , enclosed areas . Three broods may be produced by a pair each breeding season and pigeons may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite often and therefore breed all year round , " Zahid Bhatti said . Pigeons have always been loved by human beings , however they also create health hazards in some situations . Especially their feaces are a potential problem for human health . Health hazard of their droppings was the main reason why London Mayor Ken Livingstone thought to remove them from the Trafalgar Square in 2003 . However , Lahore 's pigeon corners do not cater to so big a population that it may cause such hazards .

Due to one-day strike in the city , the national economy suffered the loss of Rs10 billion . While the unchecked violence spreading over a number of weeks caused total loss of Rs100 billion to the national economy , economist , industrialist and traders have estimated . Besides , the domestic investors are reluctant to invest in the country and the foreign investors follow the suit . Due to uncertainty and day-to-day strikes in the city , the foreign importers also feel that they should give repeat orders for imports from Pakistan thereby affecting exports of the country . Whenever there was strike in Karachi , the overseas Pakistanis who wanted to send remittances to their families through banking system switched to hundi system , said economist Dr Shahid Hassan Siddiqui , adding the strikes could therefore affect the quantum of remittances and there was pressure on the rupee-dollars parity . Breakdown of the law and order hampered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in five industrials areas of the city as activities in majority of the industrial areas came to a grinding halt .

Besides , it would also affect 0.5 million direct employees , he added . The total loss including exports has reached around Rs 1 billion per day to one industrial zone out of the five industrial zones in Karachi . Shamim Ahmed Shamsi , former Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry president said the city had suffered Rs10 billion single-day loss in terms of production , suspension in sales and exports , demurrage at ports on imported goods , loss of perishable goods , daily wage earners , non-salary disbursement , transportation of goods , non-plying of public transport , sale loss to shop owners and government revenues .

@@4534239 <h> Email <p> It was a dark and stormy night , with rain lashing violently , thunder booming like cannons and dogs howling like banshees . I raced across the deserted graveyard , dodged past the lady in white with backward pointing feet and crashed through the aik kamray ki jhopri in which we lived . <p> " Maa , " I yelled " Mei aap ki dawa ley aaya huun Maa ! " <p> My frail , diseased mother was prostrating on the janamaz . She stirred listlessly , then got up with tears in her broken , cataract-riddled eyes and said to me , " Bete , dawa tou lay aaye ho , magar internet meme kab laao gay ? " <p> " Nahiiiiiiiii ... " <p> The internet meme is to our age what the novel was to the turn of the century . The greatest truths of our era seem to be contained in biting Charlies and Paedobears circulating the internet . <p> As this art form is still quite novel ( see what I did there ? ) it has slowly traversed across the planet , varying by the degree of technological penetration and amount of useless hours available to its populace . Once this critical point is reached , the internet meme -- like any art form -- begins to manifest reflections of its own society . <p> The first one that I can imagine being dubbed a genuine internet phenomenon has to be the iconic Chand Nawab video . It came at a time when the media was slowly gaining ubiquity , but like the travelers who keep interrupting his piece-to-camera , no one was quite sure what to do about it . Soon after , there was the video where a future Prime Minister showed he could fondle like Ronaldinho could pass - without needing to look at the recipient . And there was the bainul-aqwami super hit when a student protested at the cruel humour of automatic doors by running through glass . And no one can ever forget the philosophical inquiry into the construction of the modern Saudi state which started in the desert . <p> But none of these viral videos have spawned the sheer expanse of catchphrases , remixes , motivational posters and entire subcultures that have come the way of the All-Stars of 2011 . <p> First up , there was the Veena Malik rant , immortalized in the refrain " Mufti Saab , yeh kya baat hui ? " which was a pithy expression for the conflict Pakistan was facing within itself . <p> Then , the accidental heroism of Zohair Toru , who etched " Garmi mei kharab " into our collective psyche . Once again , those immortal words captured everything imaginable about Pakistani politics , its youth and the points at which the two converged . <p> And now there is the veritable Dr. Aamir Liaquat -- no stranger to the virtues of the internet , having allegedly received his PhD from its recesses . In what is a rapidly disappearing video , the roohani rockstar is seen to have an off-camera persona that rapidly veers from the profane to the profound . <p> Typically , the kind doctor has claimed that the video is fake and a conspiracy . From a technological perspective , the claim that the voice has been faked and re-dubbed is pretty much impossible . But what appears to be even tougher to fake is the doctor 's repeated horizontal fist-pump , which does n't really need any words to convey its meaning . <p> But to focus on these trivialities would mean missing out on understanding the true significance of this moment . It would be ignoring the existential dilemma at the heart of this story , this society and these wretched times . <p> The question we all need to be asking ourselves is : Ghalib film dekhi hai aap ne ? <p> Ahmer Naqvi is the Brian Lara of his generation -- he 's a genius but his team usually loses .

Normal muslims watch islamic scholars as a source of inspiration to come closer to the religions , and if we have hypocrites like these our faith from scholars will slowly vanish . The dealings of the hypocrites revolve around their own interests . When they meet the believers , they make a show of belief and loyalty , in order to deceive the believers and as an action of dissimulation , hoping for whatever good and war-booty they have . But when they meet their masters and chiefs , they say , we are with you in your shirk and kufr .

As far as such show-peace people are limited to ' act ' or ' host ' ( like Dr. Munazza , Reema ) there should not be any issue . However , when they involve themselves in preaching ( like Dr. Liaquat and now a days Junaid Jamshaid is also dragging into that area ) , it has serious repercussions .

Very true . <p> Recommend0 <p> Faizan <p> Aug 17 , 2011 03:40pm <p> Spot on . <p> Recommend0 <p> Zaheer <p> Aug 17 , 2011 03:48pm <p> Our country has been demonised almost irrepairbly by politicians , judges , military adventurers , big indusdtrialists and many powewrful bureacrats , but the biggest damage done is by imposters and bogus preachers . True scholars are only a handful and any one who is an educated scholar is unlikely to be a trouble maker . Since Dr. Aamir claims to be very religious and preaches it every day , he should be given a taste of his own medicine , Islamic punishments for deceit and fraud bogus degrees whatever they are . In fact he should be asked what are those punishments . He should himself set an example of how religious laws take care of such pathetic human beings . <p> Recommend0 <p> Akhtar Masood <p> Aug 17 , 2011 03:55pm <p> You know What people , This is where we should now finally understand . That ; we have left Religion into the hands of such people , and we do believe " What so ever " these guys tells us. and we should finally start Studying the very thing we should have studied ages ago which is " Quran and Sunnah " . Now , after watching the video , honestly , i got so confused , that how would i believe those who have been part of his program . Everything is ruined in my thoughts , flooded everything within . He claims to be Islamic Scholars and look at the language he used . He should know that using bad words is prohibited yet he was dong all that ? he showed that he thought he is untouchable and did all that . Astagfirullah . " Munafiqat samnay atti hee atti hai . " We ourselves should return back to Quran and Sunnah and Study ourselves , and refer to those big names who are not controversial like him . Dr. Israr Ahmed should be one of them . and for more Satisfaction , we need to pray to Allah that " HE should bestow us the Religion which HE did bestowed to Our Prophet Muhammad PBUH " . Ameen Lets Stop talking and be more practical inshaAllah . May Allah help us understand the right Islam and we follow it . <p> Recommend0 <p> ali <p> Aug 17 , 2011 03:56pm <p> we all have double faces , but talking about a specific sect in such a shameful manner does not suit a personality who poses himself a Islamic scholar . <p> Recommend0 <p> BM <p> Aug 17 , 2011 04:01pm <p> I have seen this video , someone commented that we should not be highlighting this video because we say abusive words in our daily life . I do n't agree , it disappoints me that in single breath he was saying abusive words and then named " Qaseeda Sharif " . More disappointing is the fact that all this was happening in private TV programs , nobody had any respect for religion to stop him on those TV stations . It shows that our media is more interested to show-off as religious rather than really being religious . <p> Recommend0 <p> Atif <p> Aug 17 , 2011 04:02pm <p> The video and audio streams are out of sync and most of the times when the profanities are uttered , the camera moves . Only an expert judgement on the video can prove or disprove it . Most of the people who are happy about it are those who never liked him in the first place . So what 's the surprise . <p> Recommend0 <p> edmond <p> Aug 17 , 2011 04:05pm <p> Oh No !

But what about his offensive language against the Sahaba-e-Karam ? .... There is no difference between him and the fake peers who are looting people all over the country ... Its a shame but our understanding of the true religion is very weak and as a result we rely on these hypocrites for our knowledge ... <p> Recommend0 <p> iceman <p> Aug 17 , 2011 04:12pm <p> the sad part of all this is that our society has started accepting everything from corrupt politicians to hypocrite anchors ! i saw his show last night and he was doing his drama as usual and " aunties " kept calling and giving him duaas &amp; asking mufti questions . from top down everyone is corrupt in our society . <p> Recommend0 <p> Gul <p> Aug 17 , 2011 04:17pm <p> Brother , there is no question of Taubah here .

Our society is deemed to be one of the most backward societies just because of this . We stick to one thing so deeply that no matter how much anyone tries to convince , we are never going to change . Its just as water off a duck 's back . <p> Recommend0 <p> Hasan Raheel <p> Aug 17 , 2011 04:37pm <p> You do nt use bad words in front of a religious book . Do you ? <p> Recommend0 <p> ahmad <p> Aug 17 , 2011 04:38pm <p> It does n't matter what sort of language he used as most of folks do , but the forum on which he was i mean in a minute he laughs on serious religious questions , makes fun of various sects , acts disrespectfully to selected sahabas and then on the other with just click of a button he teaches lessons of virtues which he never means . This in a nutshell is called hypocrisy . there is another video in which news caster before reading a good news about him says " jhoot kyoon bulwatay ho " . BE WARE OF THESE IMPOSTERS WHO ARE SELLING RELIGION FOR THEIR OWN BENEFIT ............ <p> Recommend0 <p> Imran <p> Aug 17 , 2011 04:44pm <p> Whats more interesting is the fact that some of the clips are from his early days ( clean shaven ) but it has taken years for someone to leak these and interestingly after he had left for a rival channel and actively competing for TRPs with another so-called ' Aalim ' with the aforementioned channel . While I do not condone his acts in any way , seems more like a ' managed release ' of information to me than anything else . Why did this not come to light while he was employed at the same institution ? ? Another disturbing part of the video is where someone has added a clip at the end withhim addressing a crowd in a different gathering and tried to give it a sectarian outlook . Again this has nothign to do with his use of profanities . <p> Recommend0 <p> Amjad <p> Aug 17 , 2011 04:51pm <p> Aamir Liaquat is such a shame ! <p> Recommend0 <p> Ali <p> Aug 17 , 2011 04:52pm <p> Its not him the whole society is hijacked to these kind of people , our nation is innocent when they come out from the fraudualnt politiocins then they stuck again with these so called " AALIM 's " . Our society is realy in messy situation . Allah will help us . <p> Recommend0 <p> gul <p> Aug 17 , 2011 05:00pm <p> He is denying that he has said these words . watch his 14th or 15th aug ARY program on youtube .

However , I do have problem with his " real " TV shows that do everything possible to push us as a nation ( if you think we are ) back to ignorance . Instead of giving us a new meaning and prospective ( ( a logical or hanfi as Quran said ) on life and Islam , he propagates ignorants ' agenda . One thing I do n't understand - if you say you 're a doctor or highly educated , give us something new , throw an idea out there . And , if you ca n't , do n't be ashamd to call yourself Mullah as at the end of the day you are one . <p> Recommend0 <p> Tahir Amjad <p> Aug 17 , 2011 07:12pm <p> I never accepted him as a religious scholar , rather I used to call him a religious rockstar . <p> Recommend0 <p> Usman <p> Aug 17 , 2011 07:12pm <p> The way he has been defamed arouses sympathy for him . Whoever attempted to show the " truth " about him , actually has hit him below the belt .

I do n't think her ever claimed that he is a Saint or a perfect human being as most of the people think he is . I admire him and will always do so because he is such a talented and gifted person who knows how to talk . No one in Pak media competes with him or even comes close to him when it comes to public speaking . He is a gifted orator and truly an articulate person . I feel pity on GEO TV and its director , producer , and camera man who made these videos public . <p> Recommend0 <p> Analytical Engine <p> Aug 18 , 2011 09:53am <p> Never took Mr. Amir Liaquat seriously as a scholar- he ai n't an actual Aalim by the way.So , basically I 've nothing to lose when such a video of him is exposed .

Should they not be held accountable ? <p> Recommend0 <p> Usman <p> Aug 18 , 2011 10:29am <p> I will agree with Mr. Imran to some extent .. i think he 's not defending amir but what he 's trying to say is that when mr. amir was working with g.o tv .. it was all gud but when he switched to a rival channel all these sick things emerge from no where .. i think g.o tv also has some involvement in it .. they should also be criticized as well ... all they can think about is money .. they do n't care about anything ... they just need more and more viewership .. Y did n't they exposed amir while he was working for them .. this is sick and i think g.o tv has nothing to do with helping the society . As for Mr Amir he should be banned from the channel he is working for currently . <p> Recommend0 <p> Naveed <p> Aug 18 , 2011 10:56am <p> Yes Imran you are saying absolutely right , and we are supporting him .

He should come out with his real degrees if he has them instead of talking irrelevant rubbish . The current channel he is working for should be ashamed because they should ask him to explain his position without delay before allowing him on their channel . It raises questions about their other so-called experts too . <p> Recommend0 <p> Afroz <p> Aug 18 , 2011 02:28pm <p> I totally agree with bilal that we should perform our introspection and than point the finger at others .

It 's bad business to expose someone like that when he 's drawing in millions of viewers . I may not be wrong in assuming G.O . TV knew his indiscretions and still condoned it in the name of TV ratings . To cite other examples , pro-athletes who engage in debauchery and drugs are never castigated by their team 's management UNLESS it becomes too big an issue for them to brush under the carpet , e.g. Michael Vick and his dog-fighting fiasco , or Plaxico Burress and his indiscretion with concealed weapons . Yes , it 's unscrupulous business policy and it is not pretty , but take it for what it is worth . <p> Recommend0 <p> Shahan <p> Aug 18 , 2011 08:29pm <p> I agree that he is free to do/say whatever he wants , but , since he is a host of a show called ' Aalim Online ' , where he acts as an ' Aalim ' and advises people , he is respected and people give his examples to others . Since expectations are so high , anything he does ( negative ) would make people think he ' cheated ' them or is a ' hypocrite ' . So , the best thing would be to either change the name of the show or hire a real Aalim . <p> Recommend0 <p> mk <p> Aug 18 , 2011 11:17pm <p> I am not trying to be on anybody 's side .

This faculty has long been absent from the realm of professional studies for many students . <p> Many are not even familiar with the subjects which constitute the social sciences .

In many schools and colleges , this faculty is not taught at matriculation or intermediate level and those few schools where these subjects are taught , they are treated as secondary subjects and usually for those students who are not very bright in their studies . <p> The third reason is the pressure by parents on students who want to study these subjects . Considered as a social taboo , the parents are more inclined to send their children to business , engineering or medical schools rather than having their children study arts or humanities . <p> This is a short-sighted thinking as many of us do not realise the importance of social thinkers and which is why our society is currently suffering from a fundamental lack of ideology . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lack of job opportunities which students of social sciences face .

@@4538233 <h> Railway ? s strategic importance <h> Farooq Khan <p> Saturday , October 29 , 2011 - If those at the helm of affairs in the government , the military or premier security institutions of the country are so mum , unmoved and least pushed over the deliberate closure of Pakistan Railways , the heart line of defence of the country , then they are equally responsible and shareholder of the , God forbid , conspiracy against Pakistan . Not only the Pakistan Railways has stopped the services of 115 trains ? due to the shortage of locomotives , fuel and funds , the railway lines spread across the country and to the areas sensitive from defence point of view have either been damaged or left unrepaired . <p> Mind it the Pakistan Railways forms the life line of the country by catering to its needs for large scale movement of freight as well as passenger traffic . Look at the insensible apathy of the Federal Minister of Railways Ghulam Ahmed Bilour who while talking to a TV anchor said , ? ? so what , countries like Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia have no railways either ! ? Riaz Jafri has rightly asked ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level of Afghanistan in this respect or can he comprehend the strategic importance of the railways for the mass movement of the troops , tanks and military vehicles during an emergency ? ? <p> But I think expecting anything good from Mr Bilour , just forget it . Their agenda to destroy the Railways has an important dimension . With the Railways system collapsed , the defence forces could be deprived of the major logistic support for movement of vital defence related stores and equipment from south to north and back . So in an emergent situation with such a handicap , Bilour like people will make his friends across the borders very happy . The government , the prime minister and the security establishment must take the notice of it and take emergent measures to get the locomotive engines and trains on track . 
@@4538234 <h> Email <p> ISLAMABAD : Former water and power minister Raja Pervez Ashraf , a vociferous proponent of rental power projects ( RPPs ) , will appear before the Supreme Court on Monday to defend allegations of corruption in the award of contracts to different companies . <p> Additional Water and Power Secretary Hamid Ali Khan told a two-judge bench on Friday that the former minister would appear before the court with his legal counsel to answer the corruption charges which had cost him his ministry , especially after he failed to meet the target of ending loadshedding . Could Mr Ashraf , who had executed the RPP projects , appear before the court since Minister for Housing Faisal Saleh Hayat and PML-N legislator Khwaja Asif had come up with serious charges of corruption in the award of contracts , the court asked the counsel for Wapda . <p> " It is very rare in the entire world that a sitting minister ( Mr Hayat ) has come up with a whole list of corruption charges against the entire government , " Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry observed . <p> He said he had never noticed that Nepra had sought the consumers ' opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised when Mr Hayat informed it that the machinery imported by Walters Power International for its 51MW Naudero-I plant was 23 years old even though machinery older than 10 years should not have been imported under the rules . <p> The equipment had already completed 146,644 hours of running when it reached Pakistan , while its generation cost was at Rs51 per unit . In fact , he said , it was a scrap and was the result of an unsolicited bidding process under which the contract had been awarded to the company . <p> Mr Hayat requested the court to order cancellation of all contracts awarded to RPPs in violation of rules and direct them to return mobilisation advance given to them . <p> Khwaja Asif , who has filed a separate application , said the contract of RPPs which had failed to meet the stipulated COD ( commercial operation date ) should either be rescinded or their terms and conditions renegotiated to reduce the financial burden on the national exchequer . <p> Khwaja Asif equated the energy crisis with that of a complete failure of governance and collapse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a point of no return as institutions are being destroyed systematically and intentionally . " <p> When the chief justice reminded the legislator that being a parliamentarian he should be aware of the consequences of what he was saying , Khwaja Asif said he was agonised and admitted that it was a complete failure of parliament in checking corruption . <p> " I am not expecting anything good from parliament , " he deplored . <p> The RPP projects , he alleged , had turned into one of the biggest scams in the country , exposing criminal negligence of the government which bypassed cheaper and more viable options and grossly abused the policymaking prerogative of the executive branch of the state . He said the power crisis cost the country three to four per cent of GDP , or a staggering Rs800 billion a year , larger than the estimated losses the country had suffered because of terrorism . " The power crisis is by far the biggest constraint the economy has been facing for three years . " <p> Khwaja Asif pointed out that cumulative losses to the economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a colossal Rs3 trillion , adding that if translated into lost jobs and employment opportunities , the impact of energy crisis was 4.1 million jobs , roughly 7.5 per cent of the country 's labour force . <p> " Had the money invested in RPPs diverted to the public sector generation plants , the government could have upgraded generation capacities at Jamshoro , Faisalabad and Multan and added another 1,200MW to the national grid . " <p> Khwaja Asif said small hydel power plants installed on run of the rivers/canals had been neglected for many years which could produce thousands of megawatts of electricity in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa , Punjab and possibly Sindh . <p> Advocate Khwaja Tariq Raheem , representing Pepco , rejected a perception that electricity tariff for RPPs were determined without carrying out international competitive bidding .

That 's not the fault of the Justice Qayuum committee . I do n't think this verdict will make a difference to Pakistan or international cricket . If some players are out of the Pakistan team , others will take their place.Rashid Latif , the former Pakistan wicketkeeper <p> I am sad about what has happened because it involves sportsmen , but at the same time I think justice has been done because if you do something wrong you pay the price . I just feel sad for Pakistan cricket as well , because cricketers are not supposed to be associated with crime and corruption . But I think in a way it is good for Pakistan and world cricket as it should serve as a deterrent to others.Zaheer Abbas , the former Pakistan captain <p> " I think the PCB should have played a more pro-active role last year when the issue came up and brought the players back to Pakistan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They should not have let the matter go into the hands of the ICC .

You have got to pro-actively chase issues that might lead to corruption in the game . It is quite a strong message to the PCB that they failed to effectively have an anti-corruption programme for its players . I hope they take the hard lessons that have come out it , and make sure such a thing never happens again . There were a number of other players whose names came up during the trial . I hope the ICC would look at it seriously and not just assume the guy Mazhar Majeed was lying .

Look at life in Pakistan and what do you see ? You see corruption , you see people trying to make money overnight and unfortunately what the cricketers see around them is responsible for their behaviour . The Pakistan team management handled the issue very badly . They left cricketers thinking they could do something wrong , they could even get caught but , through influence or public opinion , they could get out of it . Pakistan has to start with a clean slate and move in a direction that is far , far removed from this sordid business . " Shahryar Khan , the former PCB chief <p> It is a very disappointing and sad day for us in one way , for the players and for Pakistan cricket to be caught up in criminal proceedings .

What is required now is to forget everything and move ahead . These things have happened in the past and the game has moved on . India had its own case and banned its players . The biggest jolt has already happened for Pakistan cricket and it could not get worse . <p> But we have recovered from this and the team is doing well , I do n't think the verdict will hurt the team now , there is no shortage of talent in Pakistan .

They were able to use all the evidence and all the technology they had to be able to complete this case and make it an example for cricket in the future . <p> The impact of the Qayuum report lasted only a few months because the boards who knew that their players were up to something were insecure , they tried to bury it under the carpet , they decided to push for victories on the field , distract the public and not tackle the issue at hand .
