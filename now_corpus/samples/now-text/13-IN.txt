Tough as it may be , life -- whether in the waterless deserts or the snowbound mountainous regions or the vast sun-washed plains -- is traditionally celebrated .

Take Chhau , the dance form from India 's Eastern region of West Bengal , Odisha and Jharkhand .

Large-scale droughts can lead to sustained releases of carbon dioxide from decaying wood , affecting ecosystems and Earth 's carbon cycle . <p> The scientists found that during the summer of 2005 , more than 700,000 square kilometers of pristine , old-growth forest in southwestern Amazonia experienced an extensive , severe drought . This represents about one third of the whole Amazon rain forest . The drought caused widespread changes to the forest canopy that were detectable by satellite . The changes suggest dieback of branches and tree falls , especially among the older , larger , more vulnerable canopy trees that blanket the forest . <p> While rainfall levels gradually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canopy persisted all the way to the next major drought , which began in 2010 . About half the forest affected by the 2005 drought did not recover by the time QuikScat stopped gathering global data in November 2009 and before the start of a more extensive drought in 2010 . <p> " The biggest surprise for us was that the effects appeared to persist for years after the 2005 drought , " " said study co-author Yadvinder Malhi of the University of Oxford , United Kingdom , according to the NASA statement . " " We had expected the forest canopy to bounce back after a year with a new flush of leaf growth , but the damage appeared to persist right up to the subsequent drought in 2010 . " " <p> The researchers attribute the 2005 Amazonian drought to the long-term warming of tropical Atlantic sea surface temperatures . " " In effect , the same climate phenomenon that helped form hurricanes Katrina and Rita along U.S. southern coasts in 2005 also likely caused the severe drought in southwest Amazonia , " " Saatchi said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsequently damaged the Amazonian trees . " " <p> Saatchi said such megadroughts can have long-lasting effects on rainforest ecosystems . " " Our results suggest that if droughts continue at five- to 10-year intervals or increase in frequency due to climate change , large areas of the Amazon forest are likely to be exposed to persistent effects of droughts and corresponding slow forest recovery , " " he said . " " This may alter the structure and function of Amazonian rainforest ecosystems . " " <p> The 2010 drought affected nearly half of the entire Amazon forest , with nearly a fifth of it experiencing severe drought . More than 600,000 square kilometers of the area affected by the 2005 drought were also affected by the 2010 drought . This " " double whammy " " by successive droughts suggests a potentially long-lasting and widespread effect on forests in southern and western Amazonia . <p> The drought rate in Amazonia during the past decade is unprecedented over the past century .

Together , these data suggest a decade of moderate water stress led up to the 2005 drought , helping trigger the large-scale forest damage seen following the 2005 drought . <p> Saatchi said the new study sheds new light on a major controversy that existed about how the Amazon forest responded following the 2005 megadrought . Previous studies using conventional optical satellite data produced contradictory results , likely due to the difficulty of correcting the optical data for interference by clouds and other atmospheric conditions . <p> In contrast , QuikScat 's scatterometer radar was able to see through the clouds and penetrate into the top few meters of vegetation , providing daily measurements of the forest canopy structure and estimates of how much water the forest contains .

The development has come immediately after recent warning of renewed movement by GJM for separate state splitting Darjeeling hills from West Bengal . <p> The most complicated knot is undoubtedly the question on constitutional standing of GTA .

@@36240 <h> THAILAND : In ancient Ayutthaya , Sukanya Ramanujan is moved by the fragility of a city that is valiantly limping back after the devastating flood two years ago <p> We tend to think of globalisation as a recent phenomenon , a word that conjures up images of multinational brands . And yet the world has always been abuzz with globalisation . Take Ayutthaya , an ancient city about 80 km from Bangkok . Now a historical park , it is but a shadow of its former self . Yet it is difficult to miss the significance of the place as the spot where cultures and trade from across the world merged to create a thriving kingdom . <p> The drive from Bangkok to Ayutthaya hardly takes an hour and a half . The city is distinctly divided into the historical part and the new town . What is unique about the old city is the way it is surrounded by the Chao Praya river on three sides giving it the feel of an island . Almost before I can ask , our guide explains that the name is indeed derived from Ayodhya , Rama 's birthplace . Religions and cultures were among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crucible where Hindu mythology blended with Buddhism to create unique narratives that both resemble and stand apart from their parent philosophies . <p> Ayutthaya is a UNESCO heritage centre and rightly so . A multitude of monuments and ruins dots the few square kilometers of land . The sheer number and size of the temples alone are proof of how prosperous this kingdom must have once been . <p> Silenced by size <p> Having only a few hours at Ayutthaya , our guide decides to take us through just the most popular sights . Our first stop is Wat Yai Chai Mongkhon , a temple complex built by the first king of Ayutthaya in 1357 that is stunning in size and detail . Two massive statues of Buddha frame the tall staircase leading into the temple hall and rows of Buddhas stretch down every side of the building . I recognise the image from photographs I have seen and resist a very touristy urge to tick a mental box . A more modern hall near the temple contains an ancient painting that depicts a battle on elephant back between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guide is at pains to point out that the men holding the weapons near the head of the elephant were the royals and not the men seated on the cushions . " They had to been shown fighting , " he explains . Like any prosperous kingdom , Ayutthaya was often at war with neighbour Burma . It was ultimately the armies from Burma that laid waste to the city , proof of which can be seen in the decapitated Buddha statues at our next stop , the Wat Mahathat . <p> Wat Mahathat is a sprawling temple complex although the individual stupas are a mix of styles from different countries -- Khmer style from Cambodia , Ceylon style from Sri Lanka and an early version of Ayutthaya 's own style , constructed of laterite . I am forced to tick one more mental box when we come across the famous and very photogenic head of Buddha around which the roots of a Bodhi tree have grown . Nobody quite knows how the head came to be so well lodged in the tree roots but my own guess is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heads must have fallen under the trees . But then that 's the guess of an amateur . <p> We then head to Wat Sri Sanphet , one of the largest and most impressive structures in the old town , which also served as inspiration for the temple of Emerald Buddha later built in Bangkok . I notice that the Buddhas around the complex face outwards rather than towards the temple . I learn later that this is because the three stupas inside contain the ashes of kings . <p> Spirit of survival <p> We make a small diversion to Wat Lokayasutharam , with its enormous and imposing open-air statue of a reclining Buddha . I find it difficult to get the entire length of the massive statue in one frame . The enormity of the work of history and art in front of me hits me , even more than with the reclining Buddha at Bangkok . Once again , I am struck by the similarity in imagery between the Hindu and South-east Asian Buddhist traditions . <p> Chai Wattanaram , our last stop , makes a fitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have seen so far . Built in the mid-17th century , the temple has a central Khmer style stupa , about 35 metres high , surrounded by eight smaller stupas . Unfortunately , we are not allowed to enter because the structures have been destabilised by the massive 2011 floods in Thailand . Large parts of Ayutthaya went under water and apparently many of the monuments we had seen earlier in the morning had been submerged in 5-6 feet of water . <p> It made me think about how some cities die not once but twice . Ayutthaya had been the nerve centre of a prosperous South-east Asian kingdom linking the East with the West . But ultimately , it could not resist destruction by the Burmese army in the 18th century . When the centre was revived and opened to tourists , the floods came in and damaged again whatever remained . Restoration is underway to save what is left but there is a sense of fragility that makes my visit a lot more poignant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

" And when we do find it , we ensure that the underage workers are taken care of , the suppliers are dealt with .

It found 95 percent of sites audited complied with avoiding underage labor . <p> Child labor is an issue that is part of the larger supply industry as the component maker that Apple found violated child labor laws supplied parts to more than a hundred different companies , including automotive companies , Williams said , vowing to eradicate under aged labor from the industry . <p> " I do n't know how long it will take to get there but that 's our goal , " said Williams , who has spent a significant amount of his 14 years at Apple in Asia managing the supply chain . <p> Focus on student internsFor 2013 , Williams said a key focus for Apple will be student interns and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially in China where many colleges require students to complete internships as part of their curriculum . <p> Some companies in China are solving labor shortages by employing students .

But that does not mean that we should be weak , but rather that we should , in strength and in unity , face all the troubles that are in front of us .

They were declared criminal by the British colonial government , confined to camps , jailed for minor offences , and had their traditional nomadic life restricted by laws . They did n't conform to the British idea of civilisation , which meant settled agriculture and hard work .

But nothing about this exhibition of Nasreen Mohamedi 's quiet artworks , at the Kiran Nadar Museum of Art ( KNMA ) in Delhi , fits into a typical mould .

And if size does n't matter , scale plays its part . <p> The solo was the brainchild of museum adviser Zara Porter-Hill . " It was based around the KNMA acquiring a large collection of Nasreen , " she says .

Mohamedi 's untitled , undated , understated works speak volumes . If very early figurative paperworks sport touches of colour -- like a green splodge next to the elbow of a woman drawing ( a self-portrait ? ) -- in Mohamedi 's last " line drawings " , pale grey pencil markings seem to barely skim the page . On a cream-coloured piece of paper , two faint ovals levitate over thinly ruled straight lines . They glide in and out of view . <p> " There were times when Mohamedi appeared to space out because she was locked into her own thoughts . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Karode , who knew the artist well in the years before her death from Parkinson 's disease in 1990 . " She was my neighbour in Baroda ( now Vadodara ) . I came to Delhi the year she died , " she says . <p> Karode maintains that as Mohamedi found it harder to control her bodily movements , her art became increasingly pristine . In a late drawing , a thin black triangle slices across a blank page -- seeming to twist and turn rhythmically . <p> The show will track the phases of Mohamedi 's career from the 1950s to the 1980s . " You 'll be seeing her first early sketches , 1960s collages , then how she transited from more recognizable imagery to non-representational forms , " Talwar says . " Finally , she arrived at a mature style of working in pen and ink that was so precise , so complex , " he adds . <p> Karode herself delightedly whispers a little secret : She has reconstructed the artist 's studio for us , complete with the drafting table Mohamedi designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light -- and an unfinished drawing . " I 've recreated her studio because I felt that was a way of recreating her . She always worked sitting on the floor , using the same tools that architects use . Entering her studio was like entering a state of mind . It was like a Sufi 's den . " Karode 's resurrection of Mohamedi 's studio breathes life into the past , introducing a mystical dimension to the way visitors experience Mohamedi 's spiritually inflected art . " The studio will initiate viewers into her journey , " says Karode . <p> Mohamedi lived in Vadodara , Gujarat , till her death in 1990 . <p> Unlike most retrospectives , this one is n't ordered chronologically . " For her , time was a continuum , she was not interested in dates , but went back and forth . It was her road to infinity , " Karode says .

Elsewhere , there is an early drawing of a lady with her back to us . The folds of her red-edged sari underscore Mohamedi 's affection for textiles . " This was the thread of how she looked at the world : whether she was writing , drawing or living , it was all the same -- they were extensions of each other , " muses Karode . <p> These days everyone in the art world has a stake in defining Mohamedi 's practice . Mohamedi has been feted in the international press ( frieze magazine , The New York Times , Afterall journal ... to touch the tip of the iceberg ) as India 's greatest " abstract " artist .

Like her discreet black and white art , Mohamedi lived in the shadows . Karode was her student at the Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda in the 1980s . She remembers : " We were all so drawn to the narrative figurative tradition . But in Nasreen 's work there was no obvious content , her imagery was extremely economical . She had no one supporting her then . " <p> Karode 's show attempts to redraw Indian art history .

Norodom Sihanouk , the former king had died about a week ago and the royal palace was closed to ordinary visitors .

Movie theatres were shut and the dance bars were closed . Bars , thankfully , were not . <p> Mourning on the plaza <p> One night we stumbled upon a great public mass outside the royal palace .

Small children jockeyed with each other fiercely to sell black and white mourning ribbons . " You already have one ? " said one persistent little girl . " Buy another one for your friend . Only 50 rial . You want black , white or black-and-white ? " Families in t-shirts emblazoned with portraits of Sihanouk picnicked on boiled eggs . <p> Mourning is brisk business .

Say , if Nandy had made the very same remark in an obscure panel held at some university or think-tank ( as he may well have , for all we know ) that we journalists could n't be bothered to attend . <p> And once the intial complaint made headlines , all the big hitters followed suit , each eager for their share of the publicity pie . MNS , Shiv Sena , BJP , RPI and Dalit organisations , under the banner of Bahujan Samaj Sangharsh Samiti , pressured the police to register the complaint .

Priya believes that clothes reveal a lot about the person and his/her life . Inspired by the long and multi-hued textile tradition of India , she left her post-graduation in mathematics half way through to study fine art ( textiles ) at Visvabharti University , Santiniketan . She followed it up with a postgraduate degree in tapestry weaving from the Royal College of Arts in London and West Dean College , Sussex , on a Commonwealth Fellowship and Charles Wallace Trust scholarship . The daughter of parents who had studied in Santiniketan during the time of Tagore , she was exposed to the vibrant art and craft of the country from a young age . <p> " We hail from Najibabad in Uttar Pradesh , which is about 200 km from Delhi . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our town and whenever they came across an exquisite piece of work they would come to our house to show it to my parents ; it could be a Pashmina shawl or a Jamawar or an exquisitely worked sari . Perhaps that was when I fell in love with the distinctive fabrics and needlework of India , " recalls Priya who is now based in Delhi . <p> After completing her studies and while working in the field , she was encouraged by her friends to write something on the Rafoogars . During her research she found that the Rafoogars had been mentioned in several writings from the Mughal period onwards but there was no kind of documentation on the Rafoogars or their work . Although many places in India had their own version of the darners in the local community , the Rafoogars in Najibabad were a class apart .

Since their work was invisible , the craftsmen behind the work may have also been invisible , " reasons Priya . <p> She says that the work is done almost completely by Muslim men , many of whom may have come from Kashmir . They were surprised when Priya wanted to know more about their lives and their craft that gave new life to clothes . " I had to convince them that their work is something unique and at a time when most youngsters do not even know how to sew on a button , it is important to record such fine workmanship , " she explains . <p> She plans to bring them under an umbrella organisation with their own office and website so that people anywhere in the world would be able to contact them for their unmatched needle work . " Although the use-and-throw culture is now rampant in India and in many parts of the world , there is always that frayed or torn garment , sari @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only people knew about such a community , they could get that repaired or restored , " points out Priya . <p> Determined to give them an international profile , Priya has taken groups of the Rafoogars to Australia , Oakland in the United States and Scotland for various workshops and seminars on textiles . <p> " In Scotland we invited the local people to bring a damaged piece of cloth or dress and tell a story on why they had kept it and also join the Rafoogars with their knitting or tapestry work . It turned out to be such an emotional get-together . While narrating the story of their piece , many became a tad teary as they recalled the person who owned it or why it was special to them , " recalls Priya . <p> Around about the same time that Priya was beginning work on the Rafoogars , she was diagnosed with cancer . Battling the emperor of maladies has not sapped her spirit in spite of three recurrences .

" Publishers are asking for it but I am writing it in between my treatment and , hopefully , the book should be done soon , " she says .

@@102237 <h> Conservation of electric energy <p> KNOW YOUR POWER : A promising research has shown that improved feedback on electricity consumption is likely to provide an effective tool for customers to better control consumption and ultimately save energy <p> In households , people use electric energy not directly , but through home appliances . That is , they consume services powered by electricity , such as television , lighting , warming , and cooling . In other words , household electric energy consumption must be studied in terms of electrical appliance use . Most recently , people 's household energy consumption has been steadily increasing and this is a threat to our climate and its change . For example , between 1993 and 2005 , with summers growing hotter and homes larger , energy consumed by residential air conditioning in the US alone doubled , and it leaped another 20 per cent by 2010 . Similarly , in 2012 about 40 per cent of all electricity consumption in Mumbai city was on account of air conditioning households . The climate impact of air conditioning in the US is now almost half a billion tonnes of carbon dioxide per year . As people 's use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reduction of household energy consumption is a much needed step for climate change mitigation . <p> However , research shows that when purchasing electricity to power electrical appliances in homes , people do not seem to employ rigorous optimisation in their decision-making . In fact , people have very little awareness of the energy efficiency of appliances , the price of the services that appliances produce , or electricity rates . According to a survey done by data company YouGov and Rexel , a majority of adults in the UK have no idea how much money they spend on energy . In the same survey , less than half of those asked knew that boiling a full kettle uses more energy than needed to power a fridge for four hours . In addition , nearly one in three did not realise that more powerful televisions , such as plasma or flat screens , cost more to power than standard TV sets . <p> Given the lack of awareness and understanding about household energy consumption , promising recent research has shown that improved feedback on electricity consumption is likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumption and ultimately save energy . Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University have developed a dynamic climate change simulator ( DCCS ) game and used it as an intervention to help participants understand basic characteristics of the climate system . The DCCS helped provide feedback to people about their decisions and enabled them to reduce their misconceptions compared with a no-DCCS intervention . Similarly , according to International Energy Agency ( IEA ) , feedback through a number of other methods like meters , displays , or the electric bill was likely to enable people to improve their understanding of their energy consumption . <p> One important characteristic of feedback is its frequency . It has been found that the more frequent feedbacks are most effective compared with delayed feedbacks . An important aspect of feedback is if it could provide an appliance-specific breakdown as the more closely electricity consumption can be linked to specific appliances and activities , the clearer the relevance of behaviour becomes . It is believed that appliance-specific feedback can help the consumer to detect how a certain appliance or a certain way of using it affects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Research has shown that the most successful feedback combines the following features : it is given frequently and over a long time , provides an appliance-specific breakdown , is presented in a clear and appealing way , and uses computerised and interactive tools . <p> Thus , feedback as a behavioural intervention could cause people to improve their understanding of their electricity bills and their household energy consumption . It is believed that enabling this understanding will allow people to better control their consumption and save energy . Furthermore , recent research involving the US city San Marcos has reported that social norms ( that is , reporting acceptable or unacceptable behaviours of others ) might have a powerful effect on home energy conservation . As part of this research , San Marcos residents were given information about their actual energy use and how it compared to the average energy use in the city ( that is , descriptive norm ) , there was a predictable change in the energy habits : People above the average consumption reduced their energy consumption by a lot . In addition , social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injunctive norms ) moderated people 's behaviour for better : A frown face to above average energy consumers reduced their energy consumption drastically . Thus , policymakers could use descriptive and injunctive social norms as a method of reducing Indian household energy consumption . <p> Similarly , The Energy Smackdown , a reality television series , recently showcased what citizens of a community can do to reduce their own energy consumption through social norms . In season two , teams of households from three different communities in Massachusetts -- Arlington , Cambridge , and Medford -- competed to see which community could make the biggest energy reduction over 12 months . The " challenges " included biking to work , weatherising their homes , eating locally grown food , and replacing shower fixtures and light bulbs with eco-friendly alternatives -- all simple steps for American people to emulate . In addition , contestants were expected to talk to other community members about reducing carbon emissions . The first-place winners reduced their household consumption of energy by a large 73 per cent . This contest simultaneously tapped into the contestants ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town and created new " green " social norms for all of the participating towns and possibly for viewers across the US . <p> So , what 's the bottom line ? In summary , both feedback and social norms provide potent behavioural methods that are likely to cause people to conserve electric energy in their households . Given that the problem of climate change needs immediate attention , the use of these behavioural methods is likely to prove helpful for climate change mitigation.

Countries like Turkey are wondering whether they are better off outside . As India continues to grapple with the proposed Goods &amp; Services Tax ( GST ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> When the US , the country which holds the strongest intellectual attraction for many Indian experts , had spent about 7 decades under its Constitution it almost broke up and was held together only by a bloody civil war . The absence of adequate avenues for local self-rule caused havoc in Pakistan ( leading to its break-up ) and Sri Lanka ( leading to massive death and destruction for three decades ) . Yet , most economic commentators take political unity for granted in the modern day . The success of India as a federal democracy is explained by the fact that it offers a sufficient degree of local self-rule at the state level . The system enjoys strong popular legitimacy and people of most States broadly see the structure as a good balance between local and central tendencies . Apart from Jammu &amp; Kashmir , there have been problems from time to time ( most prominently in the North East and Punjab ) but the level of constitutional autonomy has been sufficient for most people and most parties to ultimately accept the structure as legitimate . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in charge . It includes the right for local politicians to exercise power and discretion -- that is , what politics is about everywhere in the world . A State which has no discretion in crucial economic decisions is not a true ' State ' ; it becomes at best a local body . <p> One may argue that discretion brings with it the potential for corruption , because vested interests will , say , lobby for tax concessions ; for this reason , one could argue , centralisation is desirable and local discretion on tax rates and definitions needs to be curbed . This implicitly assumes that the local executive is corrupt , but the central one is not . <p> There is hardly any evidence to support this . More pertinently , the possibility of corruption is no reason to deny political autonomy . Winston Churchill had argued that the Indians would be unfit to run their own government -- surely we would not accept that as an argument against independence ? <p> Corruption might have been less under colonial rule than under a democratic Indian one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonial rule . The short point is that a small improvement in one aspect of economic performance is unlikely to outweigh the importance of political autonomy . <p> Under the Constitutional scheme , Indian States ( many of which are larger than countries in the European Union ) have no right to borrow beyond a ceiling fixed by the Centre . Unlike American states , they have no right to impose income taxes ( outside agriculture ) . They have no seigniorage ( i.e. income from printing money ) unlike European Union members like the UK , because they are under the common currency . Even their expenditure policy is constrained by the large number of centrally sponsored schemes which follow a pattern decided from Delhi . <p> The only two real levers of fiscal policy they have are indirect taxation and non-Centrally sponsored expenditure . In the standardised one-rate-across-India form that many economic experts advocate ( which does not exist in the European Union or the US ) , GST would effectively remove one important lever of fiscal policy from the state governments . <h> GST ' IMPOSITION ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an ultra-standardised GST have to be viewed . A GST that is ' pushed through ' by intellectual sleight of hand and arm-twisting may not be in India 's long term interests . Unless the GST emerges out of a genuine voluntary consensus of the States with , theoretically , the option of staying out , it could create tendencies that may be more harmful in the long run than any benefits of a standardised but imposed GST . <p> Sales tax has been an important determinant of inter-State variation in fiscal policy ; advocates of tax reform who generally focus on national issues and the difficulties encountered in inter-state commerce , may not understand this well . In the early 1980s , Tamil Nadu embarked on a then-reviled comprehensive Noon Meal programme ( condemned by Indian and foreign experts alike ) financed primarily by local tax increases . This was done by a Chief Minister with no think tank papers or expert input . Yet it was a great success , now copied across India . With a GST of the standardised variety , it may not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to raise rates . <p> The contrary point can be made that States have sometimes used the flexibility to spend money on ' unproductive ' schemes ; therefore whether this loss of autonomy is a price worth paying for the benefits of a standardised GST is something on which economists can argue . But it is beyond argument that fiscal autonomy allows a Chief Minister greater room to pursue locally a policy which has no Central support but which his or her own electorate endorses . <p> A uniform and inflexible GST would clearly reduce the political freedom available to all State governments to follow policies of their own . It would also reduce innovation : the history of many schemes which are now Centrally-sponsored is that they were first tried out by one or other State using its own resources . Because India is one nation , we tend to forget that , in terms of population , the Indian Union is larger and more diverse than the European Union .

It has kept back books , documents , papers , pictures , posters and paintings of the Raj and of our independence struggle .

Jaswant Singh replied that the government had taken up the matter with the UK through the Indian High Commission at London . To my horror , I found during a subsequent visit to London that it was not true . The Indian High Commission had no knowledge of any step that New Delhi had taken .

@@135237 <h> Why Do We Need Parliament ? <p> Sunday 10 March 2013 <p> by M. MANISHA <p> The recent debates surrounding parlia-mentary inefficacy raise several important , but unanswered , questions : why do n't MPs participate in parliamentary proceedings on a regular basis ? Why do they actively obstruct parliamentary work ? Has the inefficiency of Parliament led to the rise of alternative forums of deliberation ? If so , what are these and are they capable of building legitimate democratic consensus ? <p> It is popularly believed that MPs are least interested in parliamentary work . It is equally common to blame the attitude of MPs and question their respect for democratic institutions , particularly Parliament . Such beliefs have contri-buted significantly to the overall impression that Parliament is an inefficient , if not ineffective , institution . While such views may not be completely incorrect , it is imperative to look into the objective conditions that make legis-lative work less rewarding . After all , politicians , like all other human beings , are guided by a structure of incentives and disincentives and direct their efforts only where there are adequate rewards . <p> Elections : Means to End ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of governance in India has evolved , certain distinct characteristics have emerged . One such characteristic is the importance attached to elections . This is a cause for much celebration . Such is the importance of elections that democratic institutions in general , and Parliament in particular , have been shaped around and by the representative process . More specifically , it has responded to the rigours of the electoral process . The ultimate purpose of elections , which is to mould the political process to achieve common goals , has sub-served to the electoral process . This has meant that the ' means ' rather than the ' end ' has become the ultimate end . <p> Political parties , irrespective of the dispen-sation , have emphasised on the popularity of the candidates in terms of electoral outcomes rather than their suitability or parliamentary performance , for selecting their candidates . ( Devesh Kapur and Pratap Bhanu Mehta ) In particular , parties are guilty of paying least attention to parliamentary performance while distributing tickets . Nor do parties insist on parliamentary attendance . But , for occasional instances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members may result in embarrassment , party whips do not have any rules to ensure attendance of members . There is no penalty for non-performance of parliamentary duties either . Thus , as far individual MPs are concerned , there is neither any incentive for parliamentary performance nor any disincentive for non-performance of parliamentary duties . <p> That political parties do not give importance to parliamentary work is also evidenced by the fact that there are no set procedures within political parties to allot parliamentary work to MPs , such as asking questions on different issues or raising matters during zero hour . Parlia-mentarians are left free to take or not to take part in parliamentary discussions . There are no mechanisms within the political parties to provide assistance to members who wish to participate in parliamentary work . The MPs are left free to decide on issues that they would like to take up and the procedures that they would like to adopt for taking up those . <p> It may be mentioned , however , that the Lok Sabha Secretariat holds orientation courses for newly elected parliamentarians to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have no previous legislative experience need more than mere technical know-ledge of parliamentary procedures . Moreover , given the fact that nearly three-fourths of the MPs are generalists and do not have in-depth knowledge of either the law-making process or the Bills being debated upon , educating the members about the issues involved is an essential pre-requisite for effective participation . Not only are political parties more equipped to perform this function , they are obliged to do so for their members . <p> The maximum participation in parlia-mentary debates comes from two category of members : first , those in the national leadership , secondly , the middle level leaders . During a debate on national issues , experienced national-level leaders of every political dispensation express their views . Such views are widely covered both by the print and the audiovisual media and much of the debate in the public domain centres around the views of the national leadership . The middle level leaders across parties have limited parliamentary time to make their mark , especially as the number of actual sittings of Parliament has declined significantly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make their mark by either disrupting the House proceedings or raising local issues . This helps to garner some public recognition , which may bolster their recall value during elections . Walkouts and adjournments are often strategically planned for maximising political gains . <p> Thus , it is not the desire to hold the government accountable that motivates an MP ; rather , it is the publicity that a member gets , contributing to his/her electoral prospects , that has become the incentive for parliamentary work . <p> Whither Opposition ? <p> IN a heterogeneous and multi-cultural society like India , where the opposition to the government comes from a variety of sources , the task of consolidating the opposing views and putting them forth in an institutional forum rests collec-tively on the Opposition . From its inception , the Opposition in India has developed a strategy of critiquing the government not with a view improving the quality of governance or ensuring the government 's accountability , but with a view to remaining in public memory . The techniques that have been adopted for this purpose have changed over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 1960s and 1970s , to walkouts , agitating in the well of the House , and complete boycott of House proceedings in the 2010s ; all of which are determined by the level of public attention that those draw . As the eminent sociologist , Andre Beteille , ( 2011 ) , remarked . " The tone of civility has all but disappeared from parliamentary debate . Interruptions are frequent and noisy , and it has become a matter of routine for several persons to speak at the same time . Rushing to the well of the House is no longer an uncommon event , and the Speaker has a difficult time in maintaining order and has to adjourn the House repeatedly ... its members now spend so much of their time in disputes that appear to be both endless and fruitless . " <p> The focus on developing long-term cons-tructive alternatives has been conspicuously absent from the agenda of Opposition politics . Both the national political parties in the Opposition such as the BJP and the regional parties like the Shiv Sena or BJD have adopted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brings to the fore this picture of an aggressive but perhaps ' dysfunctional ' Opposition . In the fifteenth Lok Sabha , for instance , the Opposition has had numerous occasions to criticise the government . However , the strategy of the Opposition seems to have been to disrupt Parliament rather than hold it accountable . In 2010-11 , 417 hours were lost due to disruptions . Interestingly , in the same year 18 per cent of the Bills were passed in less than five minutes . In the last winter session in 2012 , the Parliament worked for only 56 per cent of it scheduled time and lost nearly 106 hours . In the Rajya Sabha , Question Hour could only be conducted on four days ; and this prompted Upper House Chairman Hamid Ansari to comment that it should be scrapped from the business of the House . Fortynine out of 400 starred questions listed in the Lok Sabha and 43 out of 300 in the Rajya Sabha could be orally answered . <p> A qualitative analysis of the discussions within Parliament too reveals that even when issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as the modes of address are designed to attract maximum media attention with an eye on electoral success . Discussions have almost always been along party lines and are in the nature of a critique of the government . <p> However , what has gone unnoticed in the entire debate is that while the top-level leadership of the Opposition party organises widely publicised boycotts , the middle-level leadership has used the available parliamentary space to raise constituency issues and local concerns through procedures like short duration discussion , zero hour and like . A survey of the MPs has shown that they believed that representing the constituency through both parliamentary and unparliamentarily methods improve their chances of re-election . The four-teenth Lok Sabha spent nearly 20 per cent of its time discussing such issues , almost the same as legislative discussions . <p> Alternative Forum for Deliberation : Media ? <p> THE inadequacy of the parliamentary debates has given an opportunity to the other institutions , particularly the media , to occupy the space that traditionally belonged to Parlia-ment . In the early post-independence period the media sourced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost all newspapers centred on speeches made by MPs in the House . The English language newspapers carried columns that encapsulated the major issues discussed in the House . The media therefore functioned as an extension of Parliament -- a forum for rational debate . <p> However , the media has substantially reduced the coverage of the parliamentary proceedings . While policy announcements made by the government both inside and outside the Parlia-ment are widely reported by newspapers , a majority of the reporting of parliamentary proceedings relates to disruption of parlia-mentary work , loss of time and cost to the exchequer etc . <p> Often leaders of various political parties confront each other in the television studios and debate the very issues that could have been dealt more exhaustively by Parliament . It is almost unanimously agreed that the media , particularly the privately owned and run audio visual media , is driven by commercial conside-rations . They are intermittent in their coverage of public issues , without much follow- up action . Their choice of issues and method of discussion are governed by commercial interest . They have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simplistic proportions . Further , there is no popular control over the issues discussed and the length of time for which each of these is discussed . Despite such drawbacks , it appears that the media has been more successful in initiating debates on pressing national issues . The low level of trust that MPs enjoy has also indirectly contributed to greater public acceptability of media discussions . <p> Civil Society Initiative <p> THE citizen activism over the Jan Lokpal Bill or the demand for better laws to deal with violence against women in the aftermath of the ' Delhi gang-rape case ' shows that apart from the media , members of the civil society too have emerged as participants in the deliberative process . It is not uncommon for civil society groups to initiate the process of legislative enactment . However , in most such cases the members of such groups communicate the need for legislation . They also provide active assistance to the bureaucracy at the drafting stage of the Bill by providing necessary data and information . But the task of deliberating on the proposed enactment necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> However , certain important trends in civil activism need to be mentioned . First , there are voices , at least amongst some sections of the civil society , to bypass the legislature and proclaim legitimacy of their views on the basis of responses to activist meets , social networking sites and media attention . Second , the social activists proclaim legitimacy for their views at a stage when no significant debate on the issue at stake has taken place . Thirdly , there has been intense pressure on the institutional set-up to accept the outputs of ' civil society ' initiatives as final . Thus , Anna Hazare and the IAC wanted the Parliament to adopt their version of the Lokpal Bill , transforming the elected representa-tives and Parliament into mere " rubber stamps " . There is some merit in the argument of opponents of civil society initiatives that since leaders of such a movement , like the one led by Anna Hazare , are not democratically elected , they are , therefore , out of the institution 's purview . Hence , their representative character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It may be argued that the popularity of civil society initiatives are largely on account of the failure of the government to enlist the partici-pation of people 's movements through the existing institutional mechanism such as the political parties . It has , often mistakenly , believed that these initiatives have the support of only the urban middle classes who do not have a significant impact on the electoral outcome ; and thus the adoption of an ostrich-like approach towards civil society initiatives on the part of the authorities . <p> In most societies civil society initiatives find inlet into the political system through political parties .

The answer to this question may be found in the merits of deliberative democracy . This results in better and more rational decisions since it is based on free and open and rational deliberation by popularly elected representatives , <p> Secondly , the representatives are chosen by the people by a mechanism ( elections ) , which is estimated to be fair , explicitly for the purpose of representing them . Thus , the Parliament , constituted on the basis of universal adult suffrage , is by far the most democratic and representative of all the institutions of government . The Parliament can claim a legitimacy which none of the other institutions can warrant . <p> Thirdly , the decisions in the deliberative bodies are based on the principle of majority and are therefore generally estimated to be fair and legitimate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and minority resonate by virtue of its composition . It is on account of this that the Parliament in India has also emerged as a platform for ventilating issues of local significance , imparting to it a local dimension as well . Thus , despite being a national body the Parliament today projects not just the macro-level , pan-India issues , but also brings to the fore regional , local and constituency-level concerns . <p> Finally , in a diverse society such as India parliamentary deliberation does help in building a national consensus on contentious issues . Both the government and Opposition parties recognise the merit of this multi-functional , deliberative mechanism . It is , therefore , not surprising that notwithstanding the declining efficacy of Parliament , members across party lines tacitly recognise its importance . This also accounts for the growing concern amongst the people and scholars about declining standards of parliamen-tary debates . To debunk the Parliament as nothing but a " talk shop " may be detrimental to the health of Indian democracy itself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

But the 1960s and 1970s had the formula writing , and Sudden is amongst the best examples of that ... these books had no literary merit but were just great entertainment . That entertainment value still stays . <p> What is the market size for this genre ? <p> Very small ... it is niche . But so are most genres today . Westerns and crime fiction ( not necessarily thrillers ) used to be the top genres in the 1970s and 1980s . Today they are almost gone . <p> How does the economics of such decisions work ? <p> This is a niche , and hence is being published as a short-run digital limited edition . It is a collectible and thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spines . And we 've sold to order , so the economics work out fairly well . <p> What about other Westerns ? Will you be reprinting them too ? <p> A similar selection for aficionados . There is a lot out there , but the day is past for full reissues . So we 'll be curating themed selections that we hope people will enjoy . <p> What other ' properties ' are you looking at ? <p> Quite a few . Coming up soon will be a collection of swashbucklers ( the best pirate books ) or the best foreign Legion stories . <p> Will you consider boys ' books like Biggles , William , Hardy Boys and the like ? <p> Not those specifically , because they are still available . But yes ... I would love to revive the Lone Pine series or Pocomoto or Ken Holt , for instance . <p> Or girls ' books like Mallory Towers ... ? <p> Also available -- still in print and in bookstores . But , yes , one could assess the potential of Kit Hunter or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among a young audience to Westerns such as Sudden , or targeting those in their 40s and 50s who grew up on it ? If the former , then you have a marketing job on hand . How do you intend to push this genre ? <p> Well , a bit of both . The first targets are the throwbacks -- those who want a nostalgic blast from the past . Those who scour the used bookstores to get a copy , but ca n't find one . They can have the whole set now . But , equally , we 're timing this alongside the release of Django Unchained in end-March here , so there will hopefully be a ' Western resurgence ' , even if niche . And as to marketing , well we 're putting the word out ( and no other major marketing ) because , finally , these are going to be sold by word-of-mouth.

Chaarusheele ! ) , requesting her to keep her feet on his crown . The delicate beauty of the song was brought out with graphic details by the dancer . <p> ' Vasant ' from ' Ritusamhara ' by Kalidasa appeared next . Blossoming flowers , flitting butterflies and flowing rivers emerged alive through her gestures and facial expressions . Madhavi concluded with ' Moksha , ' a symbolic representation of the self becoming one with the Cosmic soul . She was supported by an excellent orchestra led by soulful singing . <p> The next day 's venue was shifted to the Adi-Yogi Alayam due to the threat of rain .

The charming raga Malkauns ( Hindolam in Carnatic paddhati ) poured forth and he presented a vilambit composition ' Sundar Badan Ke ' set to Jhap taal . Pt . Kashalkar concluded with ' Aayo Phagun Maas , ' a composition in raga Bhairavi . The spontaneous applause from the audience was a fitting reward to the great artist . He was accompanied on the harmonium by Tanmay Deochake and on the tabla by Suresh Talwalkar . <p> Ustad Nishat Khan , the ace sitarist , mesmerised the audience with his sparkling recital . A scion of an unbroken family line of musicians for nearly four centuries , Nishat Khan elaborated rag Marwa , an evening raga that set a devotional mood . He began slowly , and gained momentum reaching great speed and heights . Even those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were charmed by his virtuosity . Tanmoy Bose on the tabla gave him energetic support and earned bursts of applause . <p> Acclaimed as one of the foremost exponents of Agra Gharana , Vidushi Shubra Guha charmed the audience with her hearty music and heartier attitude .

Krishna 's inward journey into music on the final day pulled the audience along . With closed eyes and oblivious to the surroundings , he began at a slow pace with ' Kaalai Thookki Nindraadum Deivame ' in Yadhukula Khambodi by Marimuthu Pillai . Krishna gave life to the song that was a verbal portrait of Nataraja in motion . ' Jamboopathe Maampaahi , ' the Pancha Bhootha krithi dedicated to Jambulingam of Thiruvanaikka in Yamunakalyani was blissful . Even Krishna appeared to be visibly moved by the beauty of the kriti . After an intense portrayal of Bharavi he presented another jewel of a composition-Syama Sastri 's Swarajathi , ' Kaamaakshi , Ambaa .. ' And , the niraval for ' Amba Shyama Krishna Sahodhari ' ! If some one pleads in such tuneful music , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The masters of percussion , Melakaveri Balaji on the mridangam and N.

Of particular interest in this culture was the ' zenana ' , a sanctified neighborhood of women in purdah . This was where the nawab 's begums lived often conducting affairs of the state under the nawab 's patronage . Since men were not allowed inside these reserved sanctums , the zanana gradually became a storehouse for all sorts of wealth -- both material and that pertaining to Awadhi culture , its tehzeeb . <p> The story begins here . The protagonist for Vineet 's AW13 collection is Wazir-un-Nisa , a courtesan during the life and times of Wajid All Shah . <p> With Wajid Ali Shah having been exiled to Calcutta , the threat of British invading Awadh became imminent . Wazir-un took the onus of protecting the fabled treasure of Awadh in the most ingenious manner : in the middle of the night , she led a battery of women from the zenana with the court jewels hidden in their jamas and shalwars . The show tells us the story of these brave women , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; with their hearts filled with anxiety and yet ever so graceful . <p> The exodus was a near success but for one tragedy -- Wazir-un could not escape the zenana herself , and thus never able to meet her lover Salim who she planned to elope with that night ... <p> Legend has it that if you go to the loada imambara ' and put your ears to the wall , you can still hear Salim asking , " Voh Mere Jane Ke Baad Aayi toh nahin thi , voh ayithi kya ? " . <p> ' Chikankari ' is native to Awadh , and Vineet 's AW-13 collection is inaugurated with outfits in this traditional form of embroidery set on all ivory palettes . The profundity of ' Chikan ' is highlighted by the use of ' sheesha ' adorning the dupattas of the opening outfits . <p> The succeeding group has outfits in black and ivory with much more detailed ' sheesha work and ' gota ' edging , both of which add subtle glamour to the garments .

That was knowledge that could only be got through experience , Gros said . <p> Sweating over the text that he had been assigned , Gros developed a deep connection with the language of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city of Madurai and the river Vaigai that runs through it . <h> ' Paripatal ' in his veins <p> For the young professor , it was the perfect initiation into Tamil and Tamil culture . The beauty of the language , the ways of the people and their gods were all captured in these set of poems , he says . After four years of study , he translated the anthology into French and had it published by IFP in 1968 . <p> " If you pick my veins , you will find Paripatal oozing out of it , " says Gros , in a meandering , circuitous monologue marked by occasionally peculiar phrasing . Tamil has become a part of who he is . " Tamil happened by chance . I do n't want to be sentimental about it , but it is the language through which I experienced India . " <p> Classical Tamil , which was written between 2nd and 10th century , has a corpus of eight major works like the Paripatal , and includes other classics like Tevaram ( a collection of hymns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couplets that deal with and advise on dealing with various aspects of life ) , and Periyapuranam ( on the life of Shivites ) . <p> According to Gros , Tamil is a very sophisticated language ; he says that the early proponents of Tamil literature were most probably bilingual and could speak Sanskrit too . <p> " If you see , whatever culture , social mores , ethics , religion that you could read in a Sanskrit text was available in Tamil literature , " Gros says . For example , the Periyapuranam 's counterpart in Sanskrit is the Shivabhaktavilasa . <p> Though there are far fewer classical Tamil texts than exist in French , Greek or Latin , Gros says it is the quality and not the quantity of works that makes Tamil as special a language as any of its European counterparts . " A classical language needs to have a level of quality such that it has a universal appeal when it is translated , " says Gros . <p> Gros believes translations should be sacred . To remind him not to write any " nonsense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his right hand -- his only piece of jewellery . Gros has never married , although while studying , he became engaged to a girl who was killed during a mountaineering adventure , an incident that he says was too traumatizing for him to get over . The Pavithram ring , which resembles a sailor 's knot , is usually worn by priests in South India to remind them of their moral obligations . <p> Gros 's obligations are complete fidelity to the text , he says . Translations can easily turn out to be traitors , which is why Gros does not like to paraphrase . " A literary translation should evoke two feelings in the reader -- one , the reader should feel that he is missing something beautiful as he is not able to read the original , at the same time , the text should convey the beauty of the original , " he explains . He worries that many of the old Tamil classics have been translated , without the intention to stay true to their true meanings . <h> Staying contemporary <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gros has translated the complete Paripatal and selected parts of at least six classical texts , some of which were printed 40 years ago and are still in print . But unlike many purists , his interest does not only lie in classical language . He has also done a lot of work around contemporary Tamil . Gros and M. Kannan , a researcher in the Contemporary Tamil Studies of the Indology Department , French Institute of Pondicherry , have translated an anthology of Tamil short stories into French . <p> " Gros 's zeal for books and reading anything that is published in Tamil is incomparable , " Kannan says . " I have to compete with him . His constant search for books and knowledge is unimaginable . It is not just literature , it is history , philosophy , anthropology . " <p> According to Gros , few people still share this kind of zeal . Interest in classical languages is dipping across the world as English takes precedence , Gros says . The number of students studying Greek and Latin are minimal , and the figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The only way you can sustain the interest in a language is by keeping it contemporary . It is not just Tamil , all languages are having the same fight . The creative activity you have in a language is essential for its vitality , " says the professor , who also has a keen interest in Dalit literature . <p> Gros cites writers such as Sujatha , a pseudonym for S. Rangarajan , an engineer by profession who wrote numerous short stories , novels and books on science , for playing a great role in keeping the language contemporary . <p> " He was one of the first writers who brought technology and the world of computers to popular Tamil literature , " Gros says , and Tamil needs many more such writers . " The French publishers will only consider something that is already translated into English . Tamilians who came to France from Pondicherry have abandoned their culture , and have done little to keep the culture alive . " <p> Moreover , Gros says even the French have obstinate faith in the universal nature of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receiving Tamilians and including them in their French world , " he admits . <p> However , it 's not all gloom . Tamil may have a new lifeline , with the increasing diaspora of Sri Lankan Tamilians in Europe and the US . Also , institutes such as the IFP will play a big role in taking the East to the West and vice versa . <p> Gros is currently excited about the project he is working on with epigraphist Y. Subbarayalu , the head of the department of Indology at IFP , which is to create a historical atlas of South India . " This will go into my list of favourite works , " he says . <p> Gros , who now devotes his time to reading and taking long walks on the beach , still has many texts in his desk waiting to be translated . These days , he is based in Lyon , but he still visits Tamil Nadu twice a year . <p> His library in France holds 45,000 books on India , Tamil and South India -- he says that a philologist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day as part of research . Gros himself gets through about 10 books in a week , but for him , he adds , a language can not be contained in books -- it lives on the tongue . Gros is fluent in French , Greek , Latin , Sanskrit , and Tamil ; he also understands Hindi , Spanish and German . And has many more discoveries left to be made in the languages he knows .

Due to these high capabilities , significant opportunities like the default NPS annuity scheme have come knocking on its doors , but it ca n't be underestimated that LIC 's challenges too are getting multi-fold higher , like its sluggish new business premiums as well as its leading role in the nation 's divestment program . The state-run insurance major has been formulating new strategies on every business front to keep its large machinery agile to meet the new opportunities and challenges head on . Will it be successful in this exercise ? <p> LIC has recently opened a new front in its battle to outpace sluggishness in the conventional policy space . <p> Its latest product , Jeevan Sugam , a single premium plan , offers risk cover of 10 times the premium paid for a fixed period of 10 years . At the end of 10 years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guaranteed sum . Jeevan Sugam is open for children too , with those aged between 8 and 45 years , welcome . <p> On maturity , the survivor will be paid sum assured along with loyalty benefits . For example , to get the minimum maturity sum assured of around Rs 60,000 , the single premium would be Rs. 33,759 . The life cover , on death before policy expiry , is 10 times the single premium amount after deducting service tax . <p> In case of death after five years of the policy term , loyalty addition will also be paid , although that amount is not specified upfront . <p> For maturity sum assured of over Rs 1,50,000 , an additional maturity sum assured of 3.5% is provided to the policyholder . For maturity sum of over Rs 4,00,000 , higher additional maturity sum assured of 4.5% is provided . <p> This plan suits even those who do n't foresee a regular income in future but still want to protect themselves by taking a risk cover now with some money they have now . A single premium plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paying regular premium . Jeevan Sugam favours the young the most , as the policy 's maturity value is higher for people in the lower age groups . <p> The real value of the plan is hidden , as the real value will be if and when the interest rates come down significantly over the next 1-5 years , and doubling of money even by 10 years would appear difficult . In such a scenario , it can be seen that Jeevan Sugam 's life cover comes virtually for free . <p> The scheme which is closed-ended and open only till March 31st , has been garnering good subscriptions . LIC had to make this innovative scheme closed-ended as it provides assured rate of return , which mandates that the offer period should have a uniform interest rate in the country . <p> New products like Jeevan Sugam is critical for LIC as the insurance heavyweight 's best performing class of products continue to be single premium ones . <p> All insurance companies including LIC has seen new business premiums dipping in the April to January period . Though it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that of private insurers for the first time , not only is the relative underperformance small - 6.5% against 5% - but the absolute volumes speak for itself - with LIC still accounting for more than double of the business of all private insurers combined . <p> LIC continues to record this kind of performance based on their relatively superior honouring of life cover claims , as well as its unique sales model driven by a large pool of agents . <p> The lapsation rate with LIC is a low 9% , which is attributable to fair claim processing as well as the efficient servicing by agents . The penetration of LIC agents into the vast Indian population is legendary , with LIC and its agents reported to have covered every region were 1000 people were living with at least one agent , way back from 1969 . Despite alternative distribution channels like bancassurance being mooted , LIC 's agent army remains one of its core strategic advantages . <p> Hints from the recruitment side also shows that LIC is not planning to lie low during this sluggish phase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the next growth phase . Life Insurance Corporation has recently invited online applications for filling up 750 vacancies for the post of Assistant Administrative Officer ( AAO ) . <p> Candidates recruited will be able to work in different streams such as Marketing , Finance , Investment , IT , Customer Relations , Underwriting , Actuarial , HR and Legal . The total emoluments for the post is handsome , compared with say public sector banks , at Rs 33,418 per month in any ' A ' class city . <p> LIC should indeed be preparing for the good times , as its unique capabilities are attracting massive new opportunities . <p> Recently , pension fund regulator PFRDA has chosen LIC as the default annuity service provider for subscribers exiting from New Pension System ( NPS ) and seeking withdrawal of accumulated pension wealth . <p> While subscribers were earlier required to select an empanelled ASP along with an annuity scheme from those offered by the chosen ASP at the time of exiting from NPS , PFRDA has now decided to assist subscribers by providing a default option - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a top PFRDA official clarified that , " LIC has been chosen as the default ASP , and this default option is being provided in the subscribers ' interest and to avoid any delay in claim processing . " <p> The opportunity is huge , even for LIC , as under the provisions of NPS , a maximum of 60% of corpus accumulated at the time of exit , which is normally on the attainment of 60 years of age , can be withdrawn but a minimum 40% of corpus has to be utilised for purchasing an annuity . <p> And the numbers are huge . Even while the NPS was only open for the new recruits who join government service on or after January 1 , 2004 , by the end of 2012 , over 42 lakh subscriptions were enrolled with a corpus of over Rs 26,000 crore . And from May 2009 , the floodgates were opened , when the NPS was opened up for all citizens in India to join on a voluntary basis . <p> The default scheme from LIC offers annuity - which is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the holder at specified intervals for life - with an additional provision of 100% of the annuity payable to spouse during his/her life after the death of the annuitant . <p> LIC is also going great guns in its other core area of operation - capital market investments . Though there might be critics of the way in which LIC is said to have ' bailed out ' various disinvestments of the government like NALCO , NTPC , Oil India , Hindustan Copper , NMDC , RCF , &amp; SAIL , only time will prove whether it is a bailing out or highly attractive investments for the insurer . <p> If LIC 's recent performance in profit-booking is any indication , LIC has that rare ability to make good on all these investments . Reportedly , LIC is set to end the current financial year with record profits from sale of equities , amounting to about Rs 24,000 crore , which is its highest ever . The state-run insurer smartly sold off massive quantities of long-held stocks into the recent FII led rally . <p> But as always , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prudent churn . For example , it cut it position in Federal Bank even as it emerged as the largest investor in Karnataka Bank . <p> On the longer horizon , another shot in the arm will come by way of LIC , when it gets into banking through its subsidiary LIC Housing Finance . Commenting on the recent RBI guidelines on new banking licences , LIC has openly come out with its ambition to float a bank . <p> LIC Chairman DK Mehrotra recently summed it all up to reporters , where the organization is standing with regard to its ambitious Vision 2020 Program . " Going by the enthusiasm and response , we hope that giving a policy to every insurable person by 2020 should be fulfilled . It includes any insurance product , depending on the person 's ability to buy it . Each of these persons should have a cover of insurance with LIC . If he thinks about insurance , it should be LIC.

The minister also intends to boost export driven industries with the leather industry in the center . <p> Duty on specified machinery for manufacture of leather and leather goods was reduced from 7.5 to 5 percent . Moreover , Chidambaram is also expected to carve out a business-friendly foreign trade policy next month . <p> " It is an encouraging step towards modernisation and capacity building in the long run , " said Rafique Ahmed , chairman , Council for Leather Exports ( CLE ) . " Over 85 percent of the industry , including footwear , comprises MSMEs who struggle for better margins and competitiveness . Prices of raw and finished leather have increased by 100 percent in last few years and India being primarily a non-leather market , exports are critical .

Although Sidbi 's refinancing capability been doubled , but its norms need to be more SME-friendly for exporters . " <p> Echoing similar sentiments , Sunil Harjai , owner of Siddharth Exports said , " Marginal duty reduction is useless as leather and footwear export industry is marred by poor infrastructure and huge input costs making local manufacturing 25 to 30 percent costlier than Asean nations .

Despite our products being of international quality , challenge for local exporters is that international market wants quality at cheap rate , which we ca n't due to our non-ability to achieve mass production .

That he was approaching his 35th birthday was more apparent than ever from the increasing thought-lines on his face . <p> The Antigua Recreation Ground at St John 's held the sweetest of memories . But that spring of 2004 , they seemed echoes of days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the current match , Lara had swivelled to hook Chris Lewis , and when his right foot had come down it had been on the top of the cricket world . The boundary had taken him past the 365 posted by Garry Sobers . The 375 runs he had scored that day had heralded a new legend of world cricket , full of bustling promise of youth and talent , a new addition to thelong line of West Indian greats , yet another glittering star added to a splendid team . <p> A decade down the line , things had changed drastically . The one time great team of Caribbean cricketers had been reduced to embarrassing plight . <p> In 1994 , when Lara had walked out at St John 's and hammered 375 , England had already surrendered the series 1-3 to the might of Courtney Walsh , Curtly Ambrose , Winston Benjamin and Kenny Benjamin . Now , the home team tottered on the brink of a humiliating whitewash at the hands of the same opponents . The pace attack was almost laughable in comparison , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Collymore hardly ever hurrying the English batsmen in the series . <p> The score-line read 3-0 in England 's favour going into the fourth Test . Lara was no longer the carefree youngster riding on the crest of his brimming potential . He was now the captain , weighed down by the pedestrian performance of his team . His own form had been pretty abysmal , with just 100 runs from six innings in the series . Critics had been slashing at his credibility with poison-tipped pens , voicing for his removal over malicious microphones . Besides , 183 days ago , his world record had been rewritten with Australian opener Matthew Hayden , who notched up 380 against Zimbabwe at Perth . <p> Day One : Struggling back to form <p> Exactly after an hour 's play , Lara walked out into the middle . The wicket was a featherbed , but the Windies batting of the day could be counted upon to collapse on concrete pitches . Simon Jones , Andrew Flintoff , Matthew Hoggard and Steve Harmison -- especially Harmison -- had made the home batsmen hop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the cards . <p> There was a scare even before the skipper had scored . Harmison 's delivery sneaked past the famous bat . There was a noise -- tell-tale and chilling . The ball went straight into the gloves of debutant Geraint Jones . The bowler was celebrating , already past the batsman , elated at another cheapfall of the mighty one . And then Harmison turned to see Darrell Hair shaking his head . The controversial Australian official had stood at the ground 10 years ago when Lara had hit 375 . Was it a confluence of fate ? Whatever it was , Lara survived and Harmison lost his rhythm . <p> Hesitant , patchy , the famously sonorous timing masked by jarring off-key mishits , Lara slowly played himself back into groove . As long as Gayle was there striking the ball , he was content to play second fiddle . But once Ramnaresh Sarwan had joined him , and rain had kept the players off the field for long , he was back near his best . A vintage pull off Simon Jones took him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signalled return to form . He was unbeaten on 86 at the end of the day and West Indies had progressed to 206 for two from the 52 possible overs . The islands slept somewhat better . Lara was looking good once more . <p> Day Two : Punching the air three times <p> The next day , the signs of age slowly started vanishing from his bearing . The eyes lit up in sparks of inspiration that foretell feats of genius . The first ball of the day was pitched up by Hoggard and it was smacked through the covers . The hundred was up within twenty minutes of play . <p> Gareth Batty , the off-spinner in the side as a late replacement for Ashley Giles , ran in and pitched up . Lara skipped down the pitch and caressed him through the off-side -- one of the most fantastic strokes witnessed in the ground . The runs flowed freely , and Batty was a special favourite , milked and spanked alternately according to the whims of the champion . The only hiccup was when a Hoggard direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only way England could have dismissed him.Before the morning session was over , the left-hander had brought up his 150 . And soon after the break , he slammed Batty straight , down the ground , over the stands , into the car park for the first six of his innings.The stroke took him to 195 . The next ball was swept for four . And a single brought up the double-hundred . Lara 's reaction made it clear that all the frustration of the past month was finding a vent at long last . <p> There followed a patchy period of playing and missing , but Batty came to the rescue yet again . A fierce drive down the ground followed by an impeccable hit through the covers took him to 250 . The celebrations were subdued . Lara had obviously got the whiff of something enormous in the offing . <p> The blade had become broader and broader with time spent on the crease . The uncertainties reared their head only for a brief period in the 290s . A sweep soared somewhat precariously off the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive , fluent and full-blooded , burst through Batty 's desperate grasp for four . The last stroke was perhaps the only chance of the innings . Lara dabbed the off-spinner in front of the wicket to scamper the single that took him to the second triple-hundred of his career . For the third time in the day , he vigorously punched the air . <p> To celebrate , in the final over of the day , Lara launched the part time spin of captain Michael Vaughan out of the ground . He remained unbeaten on 313 . West Indies were 595 for five . <p> Day Three : Tumbling records <p> In a decision that raised quite a few eyebrows , Lara did not close the innings overnight . West Indies carried on , Lara and Ridley Jacobs continuing to stretch the innings . Lara hinted at going for 750 , the highest England had ever conceded . However , to many it seemed it was Lara 's quest to reclaim his record . No one in the history of the game had ever taken the batting crown back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At 332 there was a 22-ball scoreless period that strained the nerves of entire West Indies . There was a bit of uncertainty in the 350s , when a couple of balls beat him -- a sight that had grown well-nigh unbelievable through the three days . At 370 , he flirted outside the off-stump and the crowd gasped as Jones threw the ball up in mock celebration . <p> But , at 374 , he passed his highest score and caught up with Hayden in exquisite style . Batty , once again in the annals of history for all the wrong reasons , flighted invitingly , and Lara launched him into the stands beyond long-on . The next ball was flat and down the leg-side . Lara swept to the fine-leg boundary for four . The world record score in Test cricket changed hands for the 10th time . For the first time it had been reclaimed .

Read More <p> PANAJI : Hold the cheers . Goa is no nearer to attaining special status than it was a day ago , or a year ago . A resolution demanding special status passed by the legislative assembly is meaningless unless it is acted upon . To take the resolution to its logical conclusion it would require action from the Union government and a bill introduced and passed in Parliament . That , under the Indian Constitution , is a big ask and hence special status turning into a reality doubtful . <p> " I have my doubts that this resolution will be acted upon by Parliament and a bill passed . The odds are stacked against it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take up the resolution . This resolution is merely passing the buck to the Centre , " former Union minister of state for external affairs and finance Eduardo Faleiro told TOI . <p> Faleiro 's apprehensions are legitimate . This is not the first time such a resolution has received the unanimous support of the Goa legislators . In August 2008 the assembly had passed a similar resolution and nothing came out of it , simply because if the central government were to accede to such a request , it would then have to deal with a barrage of such demands from other states . <p> In February 2012 , then Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee had ruled out special status for Goa during an election visit to the state . In the run-up to the 2012 state assembly elections then BJP national president Nitin Gadkari had said , " Special status can not be given to Goa . How can it be given ? There is no provision in the Constitution of India to grant special status . " With both national parties firm on the issue , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goa assembly resolution seeking special status is remote . <p> By passing the resolution on Monday , the government is merely assuaging the emotions of the people . With general elections some 15 months away , the central government is unlikely to consider any request for special status to Goa or any state . A decision in Goa 's favour would lead to a clamour from other states for a similar provision . <p> Speaking to TOI , former Union minister for law Ramakant Khalap said , " Taken on its own merits I welcome the resolution . But I have a question to ask : Are we trying to whip up passions by seeking special status ? When Bihar , Tamil Nadu and other states are seeking special status , is it possible for the government of India to give special status only for Goa ? " <p> Khalap states than when Goa was given statehood in 1987 , he , then the opposition leader , had sought certain privileges for the new state , given its small size and that it had lost the benefit of three 5-year-plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his demands had been rejected . " Today , over 25 years later we have come round to asking for special status , " Khalap said . <p> There are states that have been granted special category status . These are states that have an international boundary , hilly terrain and different socio-economic developmental parameters . Goa has none of these parameters and even some states that meet these characteristics have not been able to lobby favourably with the central government for special category status . <p> A case in point is that of Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar , who has been constantly following up on his demand for special category state status for Bihar to enable the state to attract private investment and have access to more central funds to upgrade the state 's infrastructure to fast track development . The central government has taken no decision on this . <p> The demand from Goa , and the resolution passed in the state assembly is quite clear on this , is not financial . It is land , which makes the case all the more difficult . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deprived of land for their own purposes . There is a genuine concern in Goa about the non-availability of land to the sons of the soil , particularly those belonging to the lower and middle income groups . The state government itself can take several measures to provide affordable housing . In Rajasthan , the government makes available thousands of houses as well as plots to people belonging to different income groups . In Goa , an action plan needs to be drawn to provide affordable housing to the average Goan . It will require an efficient Housing Board , interest rate subsidies and other financial devices to make housing affordable to all , " Faleiro said . <p> He added that the government should take the initiative to provide affordable housing to its citizens within the existing situation , while at the same time pursuing special status . He also suggested that if land is not readily available in urban centres then the government can build houses in areas where land prices are cheaper and have a proper transportation system to ferry residents of those areas to the urban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achievable by the state government without the centre 's involvement . " The Goa Land Revenue Code of 1968 was modeled on existing laws in other states . While the other states have a provision that agricultural land can not be transferred to non-agriculturists , our land revenue code does not contain such a provision . We can save our agricultural land by amending the land revenue code , " Khalap said . <p> He also said that Goa has about 12.5% of its population described as scheduled tribes . " There is a constitutional provision that protects the rights of the scheduled tribes by a presidential order . Ask for special provision for scheduled tribes and save their land , " Khalap said . <p> Article 19(5) of the Constitution provides for special restrictions by the state " for the protection of the interests of any scheduled tribe " and this could include a ban on ownership of land by non-tribals in tribal areas . <p> With special status never being easy to attain-chief minister Manohar Parrikar hinted that there may be required an agitation to get special status @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back on provisions that exist in the state to safeguard land may be a better option to follow until such time there is a government at the centre that is amenable to providing special category status to Goa and other states . <p> RELATED <h> From around the web <h> More from The Times of India <p> Recommended By Colombia <h> From Around the Web <h> More From The Times of India <p> Recommended By Colombia <h> Comments <p> Characters Remaining : 3000 <h> OR PROCEED WITHOUT REGISTRATION <p> Share on Twitter <h> SIGN IN WITH <p> FacebookGoogleEmail <p> Refrain from posting comments that are obscene , defamatory or inflammatory , and do not indulge in personal attacks , name calling or inciting hatred against any community .

Outside the J.N Tata Auditorium is a 1,200 square foot cafeteria where round tables are arranged for journalists and others , including the management . Generally , on the farthest corner , some of the Infosys management would mingle with journalists , discuss performance or even turn a few of them away politely . However , in this quarter , after the results announcements and some interactions on the sidelines , the management did not mingle with the journalists . <p> The body language of Infosys management indicated concern and it coincided with the performance of once India 's bellwether stock which lost 22 per cent of its value in a single trading session on April 12th . Concerns were around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still continue to see as unusual . <p> Concerns around annual guidance , not issuing an Earnings Per Share ( EPS ) - which is an indicator of a company 's profitability guidance for the fiscal 2014 , continued pressure on margins , challenges in its portfolio of clients have all got analysts go back to their drawing boards to reassess their stand on the stock . It has got analysts in knots over the performance of IT stocks in the sector . While Infosys struggles , competitor HCL Tech reported a 73 per cent jump in net profits to $193 million in its third quarter , beating analyst expectations . <p> " The IT sector is a slaughterhouse and Infosys ' results have reiterated the fact that this is not a sector to make money , " Gaurang Shah , Geojit BNP told Business Line ( at the time of writing this , TCS and Wipro are yet to announce their quarterly results ) . This is not the first time that Shah is bearish on the sector . In January , before the third quarter results , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Infosys got industry watchers to be upbeat on the performance of Indian IT sector . The company beat market expectations , maintained its margins ( at around 28.6 per cent ) despite high operating costs , increased revenues by 12 per cent in Q3 when compared to the previous quarter and improved its productivity that increased analyst 's expectations . After a long time , Infosys was beginning to match up to its peers like TCS and Cognizant who have been consistently beating the company on most of the parameters such as growth , deal pipeline , client relationships and employee productivity . <p> Taking a similar viewpoint , analysts like Citi have become cautious on the IT sector . However , others are not writing off the sector . CLSA sees this as a company specific issue while the outlook for the IT sector remains upbeat . The BSE IT sector index outperformed benchmark indices in the January-March quarter due to positive outlook from Nasscom . <h> Lost momentum <p> " The momentum that they had built up in the second quarter seems to have been washed away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter , the company had said that it has a strong deal pipeline but that has all been set back , " says Jagannadham Thunuguntla , Strategist , SMC Global Securities . At the heart is the guidance , which is too broad ( 6-10 per cent ) , below Nasscom estimates of 11-14 per cent , a strategy that focuses on getting more productivity from employees ( instead of adding additional people to projects ) and bagging deals at industry leading margins . " The broad range shows that the company is conservative in a volatile economic climate , " says Rumit Dugar , Analyst , Religare . CEO S.D. Shibulal agrees and in a recent chat with Business Line said that Infosys has gone through a very volatile two years and so , it makes sense to broaden this range and give a safe guidance . <p> The guidance is a sign of broader issues that are at the heart of the company . Pricing declines by 0.7 per cent over previous quarter , revenue growth at a mere 1.4 per cent as against expectations of 4 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 70.9 per cent , which is adding to a bulging bench , high attrition are plaguing the company , says Ankita Somani , Analyst , Angel Broking . <p> The company is targeting a 70:30 combination of freshers to experienced employees in a bid to get more productivity and more importantly the ability to execute projects involving complex technologies . <p> Part of all this pain lies in a transformation that Shibulal undertook since he took over as CEO in 2011 wherein the company will change its revenue mix and plans to get 30 per cent of its revenues from products , platforms and solutions ( PPS ) . This does not require an army of coders but rely on reusing existing tech and developing Intellectual Property around it that companies like IBM having been doing for decades . Betting on the fact that despite an economic slowdown faced by its clients in the developed economies , outsourcing would go up has not panned out as expected . competition from Indian and international companies have intensified and some of them have been more nimbler by moving into new tech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to industry watchers . <p> This turmoil has resulted in third placed Cognizant , hot on the heels when it comes to revenues and industry leader TCS comfortably which is ahead in terms of revenues is starting to get ahead in terms of margins and in the three quarters of FY13 , TCS is half a percentage point ahead . Interestingly , this is an area where analysts see Infosys facing a lot of pressure and are of the opinion that they may have to sacrifice margins for growth . The key hurdle of Infosys is not the poor set of results but the massive downgrade of margins which will weigh in future earnings , said CLSA in a note to investors . The global brokerage house has slashed its 12 months price target from Rs 3,100 to Rs 2,650 . <h> Positives remain <p> Despite lacklustre performance , there are still some positives . Revenues from PPS has gone up 5.1 per cent and not contributes 5.7 per cent of overall revenues . Further , Infosys estimates that the total value of these sort of contracts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the third quarter . Its banking product Finacle reported a 6.5 per cent growth . Shibulal admits that exposure to banking and financial services is high at 33.9 per cent , manufacturing is catching up and contributed 22.2 per cent , thereby signalling better spends from companies in that sector . <p> Despite this , questions continue to remain over the performance consistency , once associated with Infosys . While Shibulal has gone on record saying that conservativeness and Infosys should not be associated to each other , analysts are still to be convinced about this strategy , which involves acquisitions to fuel growth . " The recent $100 million set aside to invest in PPS ideas is a little late considering that the strategy was announced more than 18 months back , " said a rival India head of a European MNC . Considering that the company is sitting on a cash pile of Rs 21,800 crore , making acquisitions that will help bring more IP in specific areas seems to be the way forward , according to industry watchers . Rival TCS has acquired Alti , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this month . <p> While Infosys plays a balancing game of having enough cash on the books to ride economic uncertainties and grow via acquisitions , one thing is certain . The company needs to put to rest the inconsistency over the last 18 months and variations in guidance multiple times . 
@@212238 <h> License of liquor shops to expire in June : no takers for renewal <p> Sensing the sluggish sentiment , excise commissioner Sameer Sharma has a called a meeting of the retail liquor traders , where he will invite their suggestions to iron out the issue . <p> TNN Apr 18 , 2013 , 08.11 PM IST <p> HYDERABAD : The state is set to see a drastic slump in the number of licensed liquor outlets come July , with retail dealers wary of paying the renewal fee that they consider exorbitant . As the license term is going to end on June 30 , officials in the excise department said they were expecting not more than 1500 shops coming up for renewal , while some 6000 licenses were issued last year following the government announcing a new liquor policy . <p> Sensing the sluggish sentiment , excise commissioner Sameer Sharma has a called a meeting of the retail liquor traders , where he will invite their suggestions to iron out the issue . <p> " We are deliberating on drafting a new excise policy for the coming year , while the renewal of the existing licenses is the main focus . After taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traders and distillers , we will submit a report to the government in mid-May , " said Sameer Sharma . <p> Departing from the traditional practice of fixing a two-year term , the government issued licenses for one year in June 2012 giving an option of renewal for one more year from July 1 2013 . Doing way with auctioning , the government allotted the shops through draw of lots with a fixed license fee . However , the new method failed to draw dealers ' enthusiasm and the government could allot just over 6000 shops as against fixed 6596 outlets , after conducting several rounds of draw of lots . <p> While the expensive license fee was the main cause for the lack of enthusiasm , the subsequent hike in levies including 13.5 % privilege charge , the amount to be paid to the government after turnover crossing six times of the license fee , and narrowed trade margin shrunk the profit margin of the dealers driving them way from the trade . <p> " The new liquor policy in place is a flawed one . Because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ margin have put the dealers in distress . Hardly fifty percent of the dealers in the state could recover the investment , while the rest are under loss . We see no reason for going for the renewal , " said Rayala Subba Rao , president AP wine dealers association . <p> While the license fee was fixed on the basis of the population of the area , the dealers found it exorbitant and many stayed away from acquiring the license . For instance , the license fee is Rs 32.5 lakh , which is a minimum , in a place where the population is less than 10000 , in the city of Hyderabad where the population is more than 7 lakh , it is Rs 1.04 crore . While this fee is for one year , a dealer has to pay the same amount of money for one-year renewal of the license . <p> " In Hyderabad 220 outlets were up for grabs last year out of which 160 were sold . Among them , just 70 outlets could make a break even and the others are under loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealers would not opt for the renewal , " said D Venkateswar Rao , president of ' twin cities wine merchants association ' . <p> While the hiked privilege charge is tend to impede the growth of sales , the trade margin level was reduced after the government restructured the liquor slabs when the excise duties were hiked in last December . <p> Earlier a dealer would get 27% trade margin on the MRP of cheap liquor whose price was less that Rs. 400 per case ( one case is 48 bottles of 180 ml ) . The trade margin that was fixed on the sales of medium liquor whose price band was in the rage of Rs. 400- 500 per case at 20% , while the same percentage had been fixed for premium liquor sold at the price above Rs. 500 per case . <p> However , with the government hiking the excise duty the slabs were revised and the A+ category of medium liquor was brought into the bracket of basic price ranging between Rs 350 and Rs 400 ( the excise duty was increased by Rs 54 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the liquor in the same category with the price band of Rs 400-Rs 450 is increased by Rs 75 . And this had resulted in the brands like Bagpiper , Director Special , and Original Choice becoming dearer by Rs 10 ( 180 ml bottle ) . The cheap liquor and beer are spared from the duty hike . <p> The revision of the slabs is resulted in loss of profit for the dealers as trade margin has automatically reduced from 27% to 20% . <p> The dealers lamented that they would not go for the renewal unless these discrepancies are rectified , but they worried that there was a possibility existing outlets continuing the business without a license what would turn them the belt shops selling non-duty paid liquor ( NDP ) coming outside the state , and spurious liquor bringing in heavy revenue loss for the exchequer . <p> RELATED <h> From around the web <h> More from The Times of India <p> Recommended By Colombia <h> From Around the Web <h> More From The Times of India <p> Recommended By Colombia <h> Comments <p> Characters Remaining : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> SIGN IN WITH <p> FacebookGoogleEmail <p> Refrain from posting comments that are obscene , defamatory or inflammatory , and do not indulge in personal attacks , name calling or inciting hatred against any community .

@@219233 <p> The Last Harvest is the largest curatorial project of the paintings and drawings of Rabindranath Tagore . Visual art came late to the Nobel laureate . At the age of 67 , after the world celebrated him as a playwright , author , poet and composer -- and he had travelled and assimilated the cultures of the world -- Tagore discovered the painter in him , a passion that he would have time for often at night after his day 's commitments and work were over , says Prof. Raman Siva Kumar , a Tagore historian who teaches at the Visva-Bharati University in Santiniketan , West Bengal . " I am hopelessly entangled in the spell that the lines have cast around me , " Tagore wrote at the time . <p> His writings have doodles and basic sketches , some of which are now on the walls of some Metro stations in Kolkata , including the Rabindra Sadan Metro station .

The works on show , from 1928-41 , are from the collections of Rabindra Bhavana , Visva-Bharati and the NGMA .

He was a nationalist first . He found his subjects around his immediate reality ; his eye and soul were in subjects steeped in situations common to Bengal and the nation -- as in the work of all great artists , in Tagore 's work it is impossible not to find the provincial in the universal . Needless to say , Tagore played a monumental role in India 's freedom struggle . <p> When it comes to his drawings and paintings , as this show illuminates , the provincial is more hidden , and needs to be found .

At the same time , other cities continue to remain uniformly rational because they are largely end-user driven . <p> Ultimately , it is demand from end-users that dictates investors ' appetite for residential property . <p> How Good Is Residential Real Estate For Investment Today ? <p> There is no one-size-fits-all formula for the viability of residential real estate as an asset class for investment . Different investors have different levels of expertise , experience , market knowledge and risk appetites when it comes to different asset classes .

Likewise , investors who lack the requisite knowledge and research to make winning real estate investment decisions will not meet with much success in this vertical .

In real estate , three additional variables are where to invest , into which size and configuration , and in which location . <p> Residential Real Estate Investment - Short-Term &amp; Long-Term Outlook <p> In the short term , residential real estate prices in different cities will either remain steady , and see minor upward or downward fluctuations . In the long term , they will rise again . The fundamentals of the India real estate story are extremely strong . Even in this turbulent economic environment , India remains the cynosure of interest by global MNCs and investors who see the limitless potential of a young , growing economy , a wealth of highly trained workforces across the manufacturing , IT/ITeS and services industries . All this translates into assured job creation , and therefore demand on the residential real estate market . <p> However , Indian residential real estate is definitely not the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trading , gold is doubtlessly a far more suitable asset class - not least of all because one can purchase it in small or large amounts and liquefy it quickly . Turning a profit with gold is really only a matter of timing the market . <p> Of course , this applies for residential real estate , as well . However , thanks to a conservative banking system that makes ' flipping ' extremely unattractive , residential real estate as an investment class is a very different ballgame in India . More and more regulations are being brought in to subdue the appetite for speculation in this sector . Also , the lowest entry point is definitely much higher than for gold . Finally , it requires a minimum ' incubation ' period in order to bring ' appreciable ' returns . <p> Even after one has satisfied all the basic investment criteria - good location , right size and configuration , right entry point and right entry price - one needs to stay invested for the mid-to-long term in order to garner the best possible returns .

@@219239 <h> Twitter Music review <p> Associated Press , 22 April 2013 <p> Until now , my problem with social music services has been this . Following friends does n't really turn up much music I actually want to hear . We did n't become friends because we share musical tastes , and too few of them are using the services I 'm trying out . <p> Twitter 's new music service solves this problem . It helps that it 's free . With it , I 'm able to sneak a peek into the musical interests of the artists I like . For example , I discovered that Gotye likes the Divine Fits , a Los Angeles-based band I 'd never heard of until now , because he follows them on Twitter . <p> With a tap on the colorful photo representing the band , I can listen to a 30-second preview of the new song of theirs that is being tweeted about the most . For the Divine Fits , that 's " Like Ice Cream . " It was catchy enough for me to want to hear more . <p> After listening to a preview , I can tap a button to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song through a $10-a-month subscription from Spotify or Rdio . I can also find other songs from the artists through those outside services . <p> As a discovery tool , Twitter 's #music service provides a convenient , visually pleasing way to filter through the deluge of music that 's out there . <p> Sure , I could have replicated this feature by digging through Gotye 's Twitter profile and individually going into the profiles of people he 's following to determine if they 're artists . Then I could search elsewhere for their songs or music videos . But that 's more work than I 'm ready to put into this . <p> The #music service highlights the artists for you and features the song preview right there . <p> The service also has a tab for emerging artists that it somehow digs out from tweets . I 'm not sure how they 're selected , but random poking around this page is how I found the broody music of Skylar Grey . <p> Finding new music can be tough . It 's easy to get hit over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's also a " popular " tab in #music for a rundown of which artists are trending on Twitter . <p> It 's way more difficult to find music you like if you never knew a band existed . This provides a way . <p> For now , #music is available as an iPhone app and on the Web . Twitter says an Android version is coming , but it did n't say when . <p> Beyond its usefulness for music discovery , the Twitter #music app is fun to play with . It is far more engaging than Twitter 's regular app , and swiping around makes the squares representing artists bounce around . Tapping to play a song clip generates a spinning icon with album cover art that harkens back to the heyday of vinyl records . <p> True , this is a marketing tool and I was skeptical to start . And #music is not perfect for listening . Artists have only one song apiece on their profiles , so if you want to hear more you 've got to go elsewhere . <p> And even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tapping the play button on the artist 's square again will still play the 30-second preview . I discovered this after buying Skylar Grey 's " Final Warning " for 69 cents . To hear the full version , I had to go back to the iPhone 's music player . <p> It also did n't track the #NowPlaying tag very well , despite putting it in all my tweets from the service . There was a considerable lag in showing these tweets from people I follow compared with my normal Twitter feed . <p> For full song plays within the service , you have to sign up for a premium subscription to Spotify or Rdio , each of which costs $10 a month . <p> This made using #music much better , although I discovered more artists by listening to just 30 seconds , making a quick decision and moving on - kind of like speed dating for music . The clips will play back-to-back , which can make for a jarring listening experience . But you also can focus your time on quick music discovery and go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my Rdio account helped because the songs I played through #music showed up on the Rdio app 's history list . That way , I could switch to Rdio to listen to the whole album . <p> Thanks to #music , I discovered that I like the Divine Fits and Skylar Grey within , say , a half hour of fiddling with the service . That makes it worth downloading , in my view . I 'll go back to it when I 'm on the hunt again for music I did n't know was there . <p> Download the Gadgets 360 app for Android and iOS to stay up to date with the latest tech news , product reviews , and exclusive deals on the popular mobiles.

Agassi -- like Tendulkar -- endured a lot of physical torture in pursuit of his dreams . He suffered from sciatica caused by two bulging discs in his back , a spondylolisthesis ( vertebral displacement ) and a bone spur that interfered with the nerve . He overcame all those with his granite will to emerge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hailed as the greatest modern cricketer , then Agassi emerged as " perhaps the biggest worldwide star in the sport 's history " , as BBC hailed on his retirement .

He also won the 1996 Olympic singles gold and is one of four male singles players to win all four Grand Slam championships -- Australian Open , French Open , Wimbledon and the US Open -- in the Open era . Agassi is also the first male player to win all four Grand Slams on three different surfaces ( hard , clay and grass ) . Besides , he won 17 ATP Masters Series titles and was part of a winning Davis Cup team in 1990 and 1992 . <p> Michael Schumacher , one of the greatest ever in the history of Formula One racing , is another who defied time and age . <p> The German made his debut in 1991 -- age 22 . He won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consecutive titles from 2000 to 2004 . He retired in 2006 but made a surprise comeback in 2010 . Like Tendulkar in cricket , Schumacher holds most of the records in F1 -- including most championships ( 7 ) , race victories ( 91 ) , fastest laps ( 77 ) , pole positions ( 68 ) , points scored ( 1566 ) and most races won in a single season ( 13 in 2004 ) . In 2002 he became the only driver in Formula One history to finish in the top three in every race of a season and also broke the record for most consecutive podium finishes . <p> According to the official Formula One website , Schumacher is " statistically the greatest driver the sport has ever seen . " <p> On November 25 , 2012 he competed in his last Grand Prix in Brazil .

Both enjoy a unique fan-following -- even in territories where their sports are n't that popular . Beckham is an iconic figure who transcends the field of play and has a global appeal . He made his debut for Manchester United in 1993 and has been the public 's darling since then . That aura has taken him to the La Liga in Spain , the Major League Soccer in the USA , the Serie A in Italy and now the French Ligue 1 . Beckham continues to have the same appeal , despite his best days being behind him . <p> Football has also seen other players defying the age barrier . One name that instantly comes to mind is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played for A.C Milan in 1985 and signed off in 2009 . He was the backbone of the side and was a part of five successful Champions League campaigns and seven Serie A wins . At the international level , he represented Italy for over a decade and was in the team when they reached the World Cup final in 1994 . <p> Beckham 's teammates at Manchester United -- Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs continue to serve their club tirelessly . Giggs has been around since 1990 , while Scholes came out of retirement and is into his 20th year for the Red Devils . <p> In the Indian context , Leander Paes is one sportsman who has been around since Tendulkar 's early days . Paes has been Indian tennis ' hope and has carried that burden since 1991 . Mahesh Bhupathi , his partner came only in 1995 and is two years away from completing two decades . Coming to the cricket field , Tendulkar 's generation is long gone . Brian Lara and Inzamam-ul-Haq were prodigies in the early 1990s and retired in 2007 leaving behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ganguly and VVS Laxman came much after him and have also left for greener pastures . Ricky Ponting , Tendulkar 's competitor played his last international game in 2012 is now his teammate at the Mumbai Indians . <p> As Arunabha Sengupta , the Chief Cricket Writer of CricketCountry.com pointed out , Tendulkar 's longevity is epic . He came at a time when one-day cricket took centre-stage and T20 was born later on .

We give it our time and attention ; we revel in our tools -- our ingredients and also our basic cooking implements . So many houses have lovely kitchens and modern appliances , but awful knives and chopping boards ! I learnt some years ago to keep just a few cooking pots and get rid of those that saw hardly any use , and to invest in a few knives of excellent quality . But I do confess to the extravagance of having several sets of plates for different moods . <h> Part 2 of 6 <p> Why call it a ' spiritual ' practice , though ?

Pastor John O'Hara writes that cooking " ... teaches us to live in sync with the rhythms of the Creator . " <h> Part 3 of 6 <p> The tangible elements of preparing food can be meditative . There is much to be aware of and enjoy -- the gentle rinsing of rice in cool water ; the regular action of slicing an onion ; the bursting freshness of a ripe tomato ; a satisfyingly thickening batter . There 's also the vital greenness of fresh herbs , the heady fragrance of dried ones ; the hiss and splutter of tempering hot oil ; the tangy scent while squeezing a lemon ; the subtle aroma when peeling a cucumber . <p> And we remember to give thanks . I learnt also , to light a candle at the end of my work in the kitchen as a gratefulness pause . If it is a gentle aroma candle , washing up is made that much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers from ancient times recognised this well .

Someone may say : ' I worked in the kitchen the whole time , ' and still not understand that to cook the food is to cook yourself . To prepare the food is to prepare yourself . To refine the food is to refine your own practice . " <h> Part 5 of 6 <p> An interesting aspect is that in a Zen kitchen , meal preparation always begins with cleaning the kitchen thoroughly before cooking starts .

Jaideep Vaidya looks back at the striving career of an extremely hard-working left-arm pacer , which has failed to live up to expectations due to a brochure of injuries . <p> In the 2000 hit movie Unbreakable , Samuel L Jackson plays the role of Elijah Price , or Mr Glass , who has a rare congenital disorder ( Osteogenesis imperfecta ) that makes his bones break easily . Thus , his whole life is riddled with injuries , his movement is restricted and he is confined to a wheelchair for most of his waking hours . <p> Ashish Nehra is Indian cricket 's Mr Glass . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear to be brittle enough to decorate his entire 14-year career with so many injuries that he fits the moniker to the tee . <p> Yuvraj Singh once joked that Ashish Nehra can get injured even in his sleep . While Nehra might have seen the funny side and has done his best to not get bogged down or frustrated with his recurring injuries , you ca n't help but have that ' what if ' feeling in your head when you think of Nehra . What if Nehra had n't broken down so many times ? What if Nehra was n't Samuel L Jackson , but Bruce Willis ? <p> He may not be the best left-arm pacer India has produced even in full fitness ; he lacks the consistency required to be a successful fast bowler . But some of his performances over the years have begged to disprove all the scepticism that usually surrounds him whenever he gets a ball in his hand . <p> Indian fans , who have mocked him and failed to sympathise with his proneness to injury , have easily forgotten that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the build-up to their successful 2011 World Cup campaign . Yet , he was n't regarded as a World Cup winner in India . What cruelly worked against Nehra was that he could not play the final due to ... yes , you guessed it right , an injury that he sustained during the semifinal against Pakistan . Yet , in spite of missing the biggest match of his life , Nehra took it in his stride and moved on . <p> Talking to News24 , a Hindi television news channel , following the World Cup , Nehra said : " I can control only what I can control . In the World Cup semifinal , I went to take a catch and ended up with four fractures on my hand . Early in my career , I neglected many small injuries . But I was out of the team for extended periods . So , a perception is created that Ashish Nehra is injury-prone . I can not control that ; I do not want to be injured . The only thing I can control is to work hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially with regard to cricket , is very difficult to change . Even if I play for two-three years non-stop , people will still think I am injury-prone . " <p> Nehra 's catalogue of injuries runs deep into his career . He grew up watching and idolising fast bowlers like Kapil Dev , Wasim Akram , Chaminda Vaas and Javagal Srinath . Hailing from a Delhi joint family , he was into sports from a young age and admitted to loving football more than cricket , even today . He started playing cricket much later in his life than some of his current colleagues . " I never played junior cricket ; I played the Ranji Trophy directly , " he told News24 . " So , I had never thought growing up as a child that I would take up cricket as a career . " Nehra 's first wicket in the Ranji Trophy was that of a certain Ajay Jadeja in the 1997-98 season . <p> Thus , after barely three years of playing real cricket , when Nehra got a call-up to an Under-19 camp , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time when someone called me to say I was selected for the U-19 camp , I thought he was joking and told him he had dialled the wrong number , " he said . At the age of 19 , Nehra was to make his India debut in a Test match against Sri Lanka at the SSC , Colombo . It was n't a particularly successful outing ( 28-5-94-1 ) and Nehra had to wait for two years to get another chance . And when it came , on a tour of Zimbabwe in 2001 , he made it count . <p> Nehra took 11 wickets in two Tests against the Zimbabweans and won accolades from everyone , including captain Sourav Ganguly and coach John Wright . In 2002 , he was picked in the squad for the Champions Trophy . It was here that the Nehra injury express steamed off . Nehra injured his bowling hand in the tournament when he attempted a run out off his bowling against South Africa . He recovered in time to play the 2003 World Cup , where he shrugged off swollen ankles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England . Post the tournament , where India ended as runners-up , Nehra had his first ankle surgery . <p> And just like that , it went on and on . In 2004 , Nehra hurt the webbing of his hand . In 2005 , he returned midway from a series in Zimbabwe with a back injury . In 2006 , he twisted his ankles in the nets and had another surgery . Soon enough , he went under the knife once again to fix his troublesome ankles . <p> Such times could take a toll on the best of bowlers . Was n't Nehra getting frustrated ? " There was this period between 2006 and 2007 when I panicked , " he said . " I was recovering from one injury before being pulled down by another . I would think , five months gone , six months gone , I 'm still not playing , while everybody else was playing . If you do n't play for six months , people forget .

He had a brilliant Indian Premier League ( IPL ) in 2009 for the Delhi Daredevils , where he took 19 wickets in 13 matches , behind only RP Singh ( 23 ) and Anil Kumble ( 21 ) , who both played three games more . He suffered an injury to his ribs in 2010 , but came back in time to be picked for the 2011 World Cup . <p> Nehra has somehow built a reputation of being a very bad death bowler . During the World Cup group encounter with South Africa , he bowled the final over and conceded 16 runs in just four balls to help the Proteas chase 297 , after Sachin Tendulkar had scored a hundred . In sport , people tend to remember your bad performances longer than they do your good ones . And if you ruin a match where Tendulkar hit a century , Lord help you ! <p> Indian fans conveniently forgot that in the historic Pakistan tour of 2003-04 , Nehra had bowled a superb final over , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to chase down 350 . Seven years later , in the same World Cup where he had become everyone 's favourite whipping boy after the loss to South Africa , Nehra helped India defend 260 against Pakistan , after coming back to bowl three superb overs with a fractured finger in the death , giving away just 11 runs and picking up two wickets . However , he was forced to sit out the final due to his injury , as India went on to clinch the cup after 28 years , and soon enough , Nehra was long forgotten . <p> As this article is being written , Nehra is back to full fitness and playing the IPL 2013 with the Delhi Daredevils . He also continues to be a part of the Delhi Ranji team . At 34 , forcing a way back into the Indian team looks a distant possibility , but Nehra will never give up .

@@233236 in Mumbai lie unused , littered , vandalised <p> Mumbai : In the wake of the July 2005 deluge , the fire department decided to learn from its mistakes . Drawing up lofty and elaborate plans was easy no less than six state-of-the-art command centres were to dot the length and breadth of the city . <p> The rationale offered for this expensive project was that the availability of fire-fighters and their equipment at close reach would cut down response time miraculously to anything between seven and 15 minutes , in the event of another catastrophe . Eight years have passed since , and the passage of time seems to have eroded that grand vision of six bustling , well-equipped emergency centres . Of the six planned centres , only one is operational in Wadala . <p> The other five are a picture of neglect , amounting to little more than waste of the taxpayer 's money . While the structures are ready , their interiors remain deserted , lacking the faintest signs of infrastructure there are no control rooms or furniture , leave alone fire-fighting equipment and rescue vehicles . The BMC is yet to issue occupation certificates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " These structures have been lying empty and unprotected , inviting urchins and local slum dwellers to use the premises to dump waste . Windowpanes have been broken at the Mankhurd centre . <p> Encroachers have littered all over the premises , " confirmed a fire officer . According to fire officials , the need for regional command centres were first felt during the 26/7 deluge , when rescue teams could not reach the suburbs from their city headquarters , owing to intense waterlogging . <p> Six zones were then marked out , and a command centre allotted to each of them at Byculla and Wadala in the city , at Borivli and Marol in the western suburbs , and at Mankhurd and Vikhroli in the eastern suburbs . Asked why these structures were n't being protected , the officer simply said , " While crores have been spent on construction , neither the corporation nor the fire department felt the need to appoint private security guards to protect them . " Needless to say , the money for erecting these buildings has come from the taxpayers . Authorities had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Byculla command centre , but over time , the figure shot up to Rs 15 crore . The new estimate is 10 times the original at Rs 40 crore , with work still far from complete . <p> Chief Fire Officer SV Joshi said , " It is the need of the hour to have six command centres for better administrative functioning of the department , but until the entire work is completed , we ca n't use the structures for operations . " He refused to offer an estimated date by which they would be ready for use , adding , " As the fire chief , I can only make recommendations to the corporation.The municipal architect is handling the project . The building proposal department works out the estimated cost and appoints contractors as per the budgetary provisions . I am not an engineer and have no role to play till the structure is officially handed over to the fire department .

He need not wait for instructions or orders from the chief fire officer or the central control room , which is the norm at present . This would help cut down response time substantially . <p> One would do ? M V Deshmukh , director of Maharashtra Fire and Emergency Services and advisor to the state government , said , " In advanced cities like New York , Chicago and London , fire departments only have one command centre , which in Mumbai we call a fire control room , situated in Byculla .

" He added , " Even other metropolitan cities like Delhi , Chennai , Kolkata and mini-metros like Bangalore and Hyderabad which cover more geographical territory have only a single command centre each .

No wonder , the buzz in football circles is about a possibly fascinating rivalry in European football , already dubbed the Der Klassiker ( German for El Cl ? sico ) . The final will be in Wembley , England , on 25 May . <p> While Bayern 's progress in this year 's tournament was not surprising , given their recent track record , it is Dortmund 's emergence that 's significant . It 's anything but the quintessential " fairy tale " , however . <p> If there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of their patient rise and unrelenting commitment to a philosophy forged by their charismatic coach , J ? rgen Klopp . A philosophy that came about owing to a mix of circumstances and a pledge to never see " those " days again . <p> The final will be a battle of wits between Borussia Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp and his Bayern Munich counterpart , Jupp Heynckes . Photo : Ina Fassbender/Reuters <p> " Those " days refer to 2003-06 , when Dortmund were battling for their existence as a club after a successful phase ( three Bundesliga titles in eight years , the last of which was in 2002 , and a Champions League win in 1996-97 ) . Lofty ambition , quick glory and reckless spending left them near insolvent . They had to do something , and they did . <p> Interestingly , Bayern gave Dortmund ? 2 million ( around Rs.14 crore ) as a loan to help them with debts totalling around ? 200 million . The CEO of the club , Hans-Joachim Watzke , led the revival , starting around 2006-07 with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitched in , with some creditors and bank managers deferring stadium rent and interest payments for some time . They then put in place a plan with a 15-year loan of ? 79 million from US-based financial services firm Morgan Stanley -- restructuring , focusing on youth development and high-skill football , and trying to ensure sustainability . Today , Dortmund have become a model club in Europe -- financially viable , stable , winning trophies on a regular basis . <p> Their rise as a European footballing powerhouse was never in doubt , especially given their consistency over the last two years . Apart from winning back-to-back Bundesliga titles ( in 2010-11 and 2011-12 , eight overall ) , they 've consistently challenged Bayern to emerge as the second best team in Germany . <p> This season , there was enough evidence to suggest that Klopp 's men were up to something special , despite the loss of star midfielder Shinji Kagawa to Manchester United last summer . In true Dortmund fashion , they had a replacement ready , bringing their own product , Marco Reus , from Borussia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who took charge of Dortmund in 2008 after a seven-year stint with Mainz 05 , came with a belief in youth , local talent supplemented by quality , inexpensive additions . Robert Lewandowski was bought from Lech Poznan for roughly ? 4.5 million and Kagawa for ? 350,000 from the Japanese club Cerezo Osaka , both in 2010 . Klopp brought Neven Subotic with him from Mainz and bought Bayern reject Mats Hummels on the cheap . His ideology centred around the " football as entertainment narrative , result as ( largely ) irrelevant " . It was about giving fans their worth -- the same fans who would flock to the Signal Iduna Park ( formerly called Westfalenstadion ) to see the team play . There was sexy football on offer . The best part about his philosophy ? It was typically German . <p> The story of Dortmund 's Champions League campaign revolves around a German core . It 's worth noting that in the 30 April fixture against Real Madrid , Dortmund fielded seven German players against Madrid 's three Spanish ones . The likes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bayern Munich ) and Marco Reus have emerged as the poster boys of German , specifically Dortmund 's , youth system . Football-wise , this story has been built on solid defence , which features Hummels and Subotic , a midfield that is the envy of top teams -- energetic , skillful -- with Sven Bender , Ilkay Gundogan , G ? tze and Reus being the prominent members , Jakub " Kuba " Blaszczykowski and Kevin Grobkreutz as wingers and the free-scoring Lewandowski upfront ( occasionally supported by Julian Schieber ) . <p> There 's quality all over the pitch and when they start playing -- the pressing game that Klopp has quite successfully managed to drill into his players -- it is often a visual treat . There 's positional discipline , a key ingredient in any successful German combination , and the movement is dazzling at times . The highlight of Dortmund 's campaign has been the composure with which they 've approached their games . <p> In the group stages , they were unfazed about their opponents -- Manchester City ( 1-1 away and 1-0 at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2-2 away ) and Ajax ( 1-0 at home and 4-1 away ) -- and though they held their own in that group as German champions , no one gave them a chance to get out of that group , let alone go through as group winners . <p> The other Germans <p> Bayern Munich coach Jupp Heynckes .

The two teams have taken contrasting paths to reach the same destination . <p> While Dortmund 's playing XI is valued at ? 36 million ( around Rs.302 crore ) , Bayern spent ? 40 million on a single player in the summer , the midfielder Javi Mart ? nez from Athletic de Bilbao . Having recently reclaimed the Bundesliga from Dortmund in record time ( with six league games to spare ) , their dominance was confirmed in back-to-back , knock-out wins over Juventus and Barcelona , with a performance to remember . Barring a blip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but winning on aggregate ) , theirs has been a near-perfect campaign . <p> The notable bit about Bayern 's play this season , at least in the Champions League , is the flexibility they 've shown . They 're physical when required , an approach integral to keeping both Andrea Pirlo ( Juventus ) and Andr ? s Iniesta ( Bar ? a ) from executing their roles as string-pullers in the midfield . Their defence is solid , organized and , at the best of times , unbreachable , and their attack almost inevitably scores . Then , there 's work-rate ( typified by Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery 's willingness to put in a shift against Bar ? a ) , technical execution at its best , and central to all of that is midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger . <p> There 's a certain sense of desire to do well in Bayern , still smarting from last year 's defeat to Chelsea , horribly enough on their home ground . That defeat has perhaps spurred Jupp Heynckes , the 67-year-old Bayern coach now in the last leg of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Champions League with Real Madrid in the 1990s , to make sure the team does better . This Bayern team is on course for a historic treble , having already secured the Bundesliga ( their 22nd ) and in line for the cup ( DFB-Pokal ) . <p> In the last five years , Dortmund have won the local league twice ( 2010-11 and 2011-12 ) , and so have Bayern ( 2009-10 and 2012-13 ) . So there 's little to choose between the two teams . <p> Come 25 May , Dortmund may not have the names , and they may have their weaknesses ( the Dortmund left flank being one , with Marcel Schmelzer ) , but what you ca n't deny is the spirit that has taken them through . <p> Bayern unsurprisingly start as favourites but whatever the result , it could mark the beginning of a new era in European club football , more so with coach Pep Guardiola taking over the hot seat at the Bavarian club after his much publicized sabbatical post-Barcelona . <p> What this contest might unwittingly end up doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a league quite aptly described by some , especially Indian fans , as " the hipster 's league " .

@@252231 <h> Indian cinema : An epic journey <p> Children watch a Hindi film during a festival celebrating 100 years of Indian cinema in New Delhi . Photo : Reuters <p> Updated : Wed , May 08 2013. 10 36 PM IST <p> In 2011 , the Central Board of Film Certification allowed 1,255 Indian films for public distribution , of which 206 were in Hindi . A century ago , when Dadasaheb Phalke made Raja Harishchandra , classification based on language was unnecessary , since Phalke 's film was silent , a universal language that all Indians understood instinctively . <p> The power was in its story , drawn from epics , which most Indians , irrespective of faith , knew because their parents or teachers at schools had told them the story of the king who would not tell a lie and who would not budge from a promise . Naseeruddin Shah said once that the plots of all Indian films owed their origin to Shakespeare or to epics like the Ramayana and Mahabharata . <p> Indian cinema has always been utterly reliant on the power of a narrative , and which narrative has greater richness than the Mahabharata ? After all for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " or whatever you find said in the universe , Vyas has said it before . It is that easy familiarity with the story -- or what the critic Ashish Rajadhyaksha called the power of the epic , in his biography of Ritwik Ghatak -- that makes Indian cinema so accessible to so many , in a country divided by everything -- language , class , caste and faith -- but united by the fascination for a good story . <p> During a week in which Hindi cinema ( which was actually born only in 1931 , when Ardeshir Irani made Alam Ara ) seems to have appropriated the celebrations of Indian cinema , it is worth recalling the richness of the rest of India . I love Hindi films too , but you do n't honour a national phenomenon by glorifying only one-fifth of it . <p> For the true love of a mother and her principles , turn to P.K. Atre 's Marathi film Shyamchi Aai ( 1953 ) , which showed how good people did n't trade principles even while living in dire poverty . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jait Re Jait ( 1977 ) , with the seductive Smita Patil in a story of the fragility of love . And in Akriet ( 1981 ) , Amol Palekar recreates the Manwat murders and the cruelty of the upper class when gripped by blind faith . <p> I recall Saeed Mirza introducing Ketan Mehta 's 1980 film Bhavni Bhavai as the most important debut since Satyajit Ray 's Pather Panchali ( 1955 ) . Mehta 's Gujarati film is a searing indictment of caste , inspired by Goscinny and Uderzo , who created Asterix . But the comic nature of the king and its lilting music can not conceal the harrowing end . <p> Moving south , there is so much to admire in Kannada cinema : two of U.R . Ananthamurthy works stand out . Girish Kasaravalli 's Ghatashraddha ( 1977 ) is about the outcasting of a pregnant widow . In Pattabhi Rama Reddy 's Samskara ( 1970 ) , Girish Karnad 's Praneshacharya is a flawed progressive Brahmin who tries to do right , but succumbs to passion and is consumed by guilt . Karnad 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kurosawa 's samurai films . <p> Further south , in Adoor Gopalakrishnan 's Elippathayam ( 1981 ) , the rat trap becomes the metaphor of the patriarchy of a closed society . His earlier film , Swayamvaram ( 1970 ) , told the story of a young couple marrying against their parents ' wishes , moving to another town to start their life , and the inevitability of tragedy befalling them , and the determination of the young woman to cast her own lonely furrow . Another great film was G. Aravindan 's Oridathu ( 1986 ) , which showed the transformation of a village 's life , and its people 's relationships , with the arrival of electricity . And the sheer melody of K. Vishwanath 's Telugu classic Shankarabharanam ( 1979 ) . <p> And then there is Bengal . How to squeeze that universe into a ball ? Satyajit Ray , of course , with the train scene and the rain scene in Pather Panchali ; the transformation of Sharmila Tagore into Devi ( 1960 ) ; the absurd yet amazing job interview scene in Pratidwandi ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ratri ( 1970 ) ; the uplifting scene of Madhabi Mukherjee on a swing in Charulata ( 1964 ) , and the whirlwind entry of Soumitro Chatterjee in that film , saying " Hare Murare ! " In Ritwik Ghatak 's Komal Gandhar ( 1961 ) , the train plays a different role , of pathos , as it rushes headlong towards Opar Bangla and suddenly coming to a halt where India arbitrarily ends . And there was the skilful use of still photography in Mrinal Sen 's Akash Kusum ( 1965 ) . And the reality that women who choose to work face , in Ghatak 's Meghe Dhaka Tara ( 1960 ) , Ray 's Mahanagar ( 1963 ) , and Sen 's Ekdin Pratidin ( 1979 ) . <p> Many have remained unnamed here , but the saga of Indian cinema 's greatness will roll on , long after the glitz , glamour , and noise of Bollywood will have faded . A quarter century ago I had interviewed Bharat Bhushan , the hero of yesteryears , for India Today . He had said the journey of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the silent to the unspeakable .

It so happened that Bebo was shooting a scene with Imran Khan that required her to walk on a rope . In spite of having a body double at her disposal , the Heroine actor chose to do the scene without the assistance of a dummy .

As a filmmaker we always look at different stories . Aamir and No One Killed Jessica were both very different films . As a filmmaker I wanted to do something different . This story came to me through a new writer called Parvez . When I read it , I found it very quirky and funny and felt this space could be explored . Then we started writing together and the script turned out in the direction I had wanted to take . It had a lot of dark humour . That 's when I decided I wanted to direct the film . <p> So you were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? No . It 's not about whether I am sure or not . As a director I always decide on the film when the script is done . Till the script is written you do n't know where the script will go , what will happen in the end . There are a lot of great ideas that do n't end up anywhere . I wanted to first finish the writing . After that I told Parvez , I am going to direct it . I wait to see if the script reaches the level to inspire me as a director . <p> What was the experience of directing a funny , livelier film ? Experiences are the same . It 's not like in No One Killed Jessica and Aamir we did n't have fun . It 's just that those were two very different films . We had fun there also . <p> But were n't those a lot more intense ? Yes , they were intense but that does n't mean we were intense while shooting or we did n't want to laugh . The process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a struggle , and I faced struggle here as well . When I was communicating with my actors then there was a certain kind of mood we needed to create . That is what was very different in this film . There was something inherently quirky about the characters . When you are interacting with your actors or creating a scene , the mood inherently seeps in . It was very different but not to say easy . It was quite fun . <p> At which stage did you settle on Vidya Balan and Emraan Hashmi ? Once the script was done . Till the time I do n't finish a script I do n't decide on directing a film or my cast . Once I was sure I was directing it that 's when I decided to approach them . They agreed to do the film in October in 2011 and Dirty Picture released in December . <p> Why these two ? Neither of them have done something like this before , especially this genre . It is not the slapstick variety of comedy . It 's not that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has black comedy and a lot of humour attached to it . Perhaps that 's why they agreed to be part of the film because they saw the potential of the film and the characters . <p> Tell us about their characters.As far as Emraan is concerned the character that came out is very quirky , somebody who is a kind of a mystery . The impression you get on seeing him is that you are not sure what this man is thinking or going to do . He has a very cocky attitude . What I saw in Emraan was the exact same thing I saw in my character . It 's not that I know Emraan personally from before . But when I met him and from what I gathered from his interviews is that he does n't give in too much , he holds back things . There is a mystery attached to him . That was one reason , apart from him being a good actor , that I thought he could pull off this kind of role . It is quite a departure form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what exactly do you mean ? What are some of his mannerisms ? He drinks wine for a change . He plays a lock picker who has left the world of crime but somehow gets involved in something . He loves good clothing , the kind of night suits you see in the poster . There is n't any one overwhelming trait about his character but many small things which bring his character together . He is n't like someone out of Ocean 's Eleven but he is very suave in the space that he is put in . <p> As far as Vidya is concerned she plays a Punjabi housewife who is married to Emraan 's character . She loves to dress up , cook and feed people , she loves to bully her husband in whatever way she can . I decided on Vidya because she is of course one of the finest actresses we have today . And I thought that for the character of the Punjabi housewife , who has a lot more layers to her character , Vidya would be the only one who can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Did you see the potential in her when you worked with her in No One Killed Jessica ? She is one of the best actresses that we have today so I knew that if she was to play this character she would take it to another level . And sure because I had worked with her I knew the potential she had and that if we collaborated for this film we could create a character which is very different from anything she has played before . Of course there was the comfort level because I had enjoyed working with her before but that does n't go too far . What goes far is the script , the character and how she would like to play that character and how I want her to play the character . <p> What about her character ? Her character is extremely feisty . You can see the relationship with Emraan in the posters , in the trailer . They play husband and wife in love so the film shows what goes on behind and in front of closed doors in a relationship between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In very few of our films have we explored the relationship of young couples . Our films end when they get married or are about to get married . Here you see that relationship and the quirkiness in it and things happening in that space . You have to see her character but I ca n't reveal much right now . <p> Any anecdotes while shooting ? Vidya loves to play pranks . She looks very seedha-saadha but she is n't . During both the films we 've worked on , she has played pranks . In No One Killed Jessica , she played a big one on me . There was a scene with only one shot and after we took it , she asked , ? ? ? What about my close up ? ' So I told her there was no close up . She got upset and said ? ? ? How can you do this ? I want a close-up . This is my shot . ' So I told her ? ? ? No , it is not your shot . I only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am . ' After that she started laughing . <p> In Ghanchakkar , there was a camera assistant she scared . She went charging at him as though he had done something wrong and will beat him to pulp .

Kya aapne Emraan ko haste hue dekha hai ? ' I thought somebody must have seen him smiling or laughing . But on set it became a discussion because no one had actually seen him laughing apart from when he had to smile/laugh on screen . It became quite a debate . He does n't smile much .

The team is very young and enthusiastic about filmmaking . They are very open and intelligent about things . Being a young filmmaker , you want to interact with that kind of a set up .

I am at a juncture where I am making what I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that 's the maximum a director could ask . That 's where the understanding lies . <p> Your journey to being a filmmaker.I am from Hazaribagh in Jharkhand . I did my primary schooling there . Then I went to DPS in Bokaro Steel City , then to Delhi where I did commerce from Ramjas College . Till then I did n't know what I wanted to become . My father was a banker with SBI . In that part of the country , you either become a doctor , engineer , IAS office etc . It should be related to the government . I also wanted to be a banker at one point . But while in college I was inclined towards theatre and I used to write for myself . After graduating I did n't want to be a banker with a nine-to-five job . I wanted to go to Bombay and try something but even at that point I did n't know what I wanted to try . For me it was let 's go there and explore . When I came here I was doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there I developed the inclination . <p> How did your family respond to all of this ? I did n't tell them I was coming to Bombay . I thought let me see if I get admission at XIC where a senior of mine was . I thought if I get in I will get the opportunity to stay in Bombay for at least a year . Once I was done with my interview and selected I learned about the fee which was around Rs 23,000 . At that time ( 1999 ) it was too much so I had to call my family . They were a little upset and it was justified because in a small town the impression of Bombay is what is seen on TV and they are wary of it . They thought I was spoiling my career and life . My father thought this till he came to the premiere of Aamir . He saw the media and thought maybe I have done something worthwhile . <p> After the ten month course at XIC , I started doing freelance work in ad films @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kashyap . I was an assistant director on Black Friday and No Smoking and simultaneously was writing . Black Friday got stuck and No Smoking did n't take off so it was very difficult days for survival .

It was during this time I wrote Aamir and it got made . <p> Are you still as closely associated with Anurag ? Is he your sounding board ? Not really . We meet but he is busy with his work and I with mine . We are in touch and his office is across the road but our interaction has lessened . We give each other feedback . <p> What are the biggest changes in the industry since you have been here ? Now more people like me are coming in . Young filmmakers are getting an opportunity . The audience taste is changing , the landscape of cinema is changing , there are a lot of new voices , there are a lot of new films being made , different kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acceptance , that 's a major change . The one single driving force which is the audience . They are also very open watching these films and that is a welcome change . <p> But what is the degree of this change ? How many ? ? ? new ' and ? ? ? different ' films really . Do n't the formulaic films , the masala blockbusters and 100 crore films still dominate ? Barfi ! was not a formula film but it made Rs 100 crores . I would the say the single most important driving force is the audience . And I think they like my film as much as they like a Rowdy Rathore or a Barfi or a Paan Singh Tomar or a Gangs of Wasseypur . If they are the ones deciding what films they want to watch it is a democracy.How does this change in the next five years ? I think you will see more and more original ideas , different kinds of stories , more voices , more writer-directors coming in. more narratives will be explored . There will be newer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not just in terms of directors but actors , newcomers , adaptations .

It might be inspired from real life like No One Killed Jessica . It might be inspired by situations in the past like Aamir . Ghanchakkar had a story which I thought I would like to explore . My inspiration comes from the surroundings we live in and people you find in the real world . It also comes from trying to tell a story in a narrative that may have not been explored , creating characters which you might have not seen or seen in a very different light . <p> I have not seen too many films because I never wanted to be a filmmaker . I was n't born looking into the mirror thinking this is what I want to do . Till graduation I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a banker I thought I would be one too and I was very enthusiastic about it . Somewhere down the line I realized that was n't what I wanted to do . It was n't like till 21 I explored films , watched them avidly , developed influences . In Delhi , you can watch a lot of films screened at embassies but I did n't do that , neither did I go to film school . So I did n't get inspired by films and filmmakers . Till now I do n't think that way . Of course you watch good films and feel what a great job the director has done but you never think that I also want to do something like that . <p> Filmmaking is n't just about a good story . There is a spirit to filmmaking and while I was with Anurag the single most important thing I learned or was inspired by was the spirit of filmmaking . We might make very different films but the spirit is something I was very inspired by . It was a very trying time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less money . That 's where the spirit of filmmaking comes in . That 's the most important thing for you is to make your film and I learned that while I was there . That 's why I make films which cost very less . Anyone can make Ghanchakkar in 20 crores . I made it in 10.5.

@@272232 <p> An AR Rahman album comes with an unwritten condition ? of not passing judgment on a newly released soundtrack . His music , in his two-decade long career , has the quality of growing over time : the free-flowing structures of his songs taking time to settle in to the pre-conditioned ears and his soundscape blossoming subtly , over a number of listens . So an early review of a Rahman album is always a tricky proposition . Despite being a Tamil album , his latest ? Maryan , directed by ? Bharat Bala , starring Dhanush ? like every AR Rahman album , is of considerable interest . Maryan 's immediate premise : the real life story of three Indian oil workers in captivity in Sudan ? allows the composer to use a lot of percussions , generous doses of folk elements and some occasional African music . The opening track ? Nenjae Yezhu ? assumes the vast scale of the African landscape . It has a sweeping , epic quality , and there is really no substitute to Rahman 's own vocals . The sweet sound of accordions in ? Innum Konjam ? remind you of ? Nenjukulle ? from ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singers , Vijay Prakash and Shweta Mohan . The composer returns to his most commonly used zone , of soul and synthesisers in ? Naetru Aval Irundhal , and has a comforting quality. ? Sonapareeya ? is infectiously foot-tapping , and is sung with zest by Rahman 's most used vocals in recent times , Javed Ali. ? The African portions sound somewhat forced , as it does in ? I love My Africa , that sounds like a recycled version of the composer 's Champions League anthem . <p> The standout track is the meditative ? Yenga Pona Raasa . The neat guitars , Shakthisree Gopalan 's remarkably controlled low-pitched voice make it a pleasant listen . <p> Maryan ? is bit of a mixed bag , with few songs showing signs of new musical signature and some suffering from over familiarity from the composer 's previous own songs .

@@279235 <h> Making cash transfers work : Some options <p> A file photo of Aadhaar launch in a village in Maharashtra . Photo : Abhijit Bhatlekar/Mint <p> If cash transfers are to fulfil their promise of being a " game changer " , then a paradigm shift has to occur from the supply-to-demand-side subventions . Top driven supply-side interventions get morphed beyond recognition as they pass through several implementation layers . <p> Nobel laureate Elinor Ostrom 's work in developing countries shows how this happens : in the unique culture of India , people rely more on locally crafted " rules in use " , as opposed to drilled down " rules in form " . And such transformation can be reduced by minimizing the distance between the rules in form and use . This can happen , for example , by giving greater choice to the poor to make the best use of money depending on situational rules in use . <p> The ecosystem contains several development programmes and substituting existing programmes with cash transfers will lead to a rapid switch-over . Moreover , three broad categories of cash transfer have been identified in development and humanitarian literature -- total ( direct cash transfer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and contrived ( employment programmes ) . The trick is to match existing programmes with the right form of cash transfer . Different options are suited to different requirements . Direct , unconditional , cash transfer is the default option . This can be deployed to replace programmes where items citizens need are available in the market , the risk of inflation is low , those chronically poor are in need of repeated and continuing assistance and security of cash transfer is acceptable . Conditional transfers can substitute for programmes in which specific needs have to be met and larger sums have to be distributed to meet these needs . Alternatively , vouchers are useful if there is scarcity of a commodity or a service ; there is a risk of inflation or there are security concerns about cash transfer ; the programme aims to achieve a specific goal ; enterprises or market in a particular commodity or services have to be developed and detailed monitoring data is required . Finally , if particular community works are required , equipment is available , individuals have the capacity to undertake the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cash for work is the preferred choice . <p> Making these guidelines operational will mean that programmes amenable to demand side intervention should be converted into the appropriate form of cash transfer . A good starting point is the report of the committee on restructuring of centrally sponsored schemes . The flagship , major sub-sectoral and sectoral umbrella schemes have to be re-assessed in terms of the normative guidelines given above and collapsed into the three categories . The practical principle is that all centrally sponsored schemes should be benchmarked against cash transfer , and only those programmes should be continued which are able to demonstrate that they are doing a better job , than the poor could do for themselves through cash transfers . <p> Another challenge is to deploy rules in use to make the Aadhaar number more acceptable by local communities .

The method deployed by the non-profit GiveDirectly to achieve last mile cash distribution holds much promise . Paul Niehaus and Michael Faye started GiveDirectly in 2008 while they were doing scholarly work at Harvard University . During their graduate research they found that direct cash transfer was a particularly effective method to alleviate poverty . Unable to find non-profits practising direct cash transfer , they launched their own . Their frugal model rides on the highly acclaimed mobile-banking technology used in the M-Pesa programme to transfer 90% of the money directly to the poor . Only 10% is used on transfer fees and the cost of locating and relocating recipients . <p> Unlike pilots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During randomized trials they have used a lottery system similar to medical trials and compared development outcomes of households who have received direct funding vs. those who have n't .

There is counterintuitive evidence too : money spent on alcohol or cigarettes remained the same or increased in the same proportion as other expenses ( nearly 2-3% ) .

@@289231 <h> By Harsh Shah <p> Like a phoenix rising from the ashes , Heynckes rose above all the heartaches of last season to lead Bayern to the most flawless of seasons . Here is a lowdown on Jupp 's genius ... <p> COMMENTBy Harsh Shah <p> Munich is definitely the happiness capital of Europe at the moment , with respect to football at least ! With their sweetheart club Bayern Munich having the most perfect season , the Bavarian capital must be rocking in celebration , to say the least . Defeating domestic foes Borussia Dortmund 2-1 in the Champions League final last evening at Wembley , Bayern 's revenge over the world of football on the whole was complete , having been on the wrong end of some heartbreaking results this time , last season . If the cake of the credit were to go to one man for mapping Die Roten 's redemption route , it would definitely have to be their manager Josef ' Jupp ' Heynckes . <p> Picture this : The Bundesliga conceded to Dortmund with an 8-point margin . The DFB-Pokal ( German Cup ) final ending in a resounding 5-2 humiliation at the hands of the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Champions League trophy whisked away painstakingly from them on penalties by a stubborn Chelsea side in their own backyard , the Allianz Arena . A season ending on this note spelled heartbreak , regret and disappointment all over . A melancholic atmosphere had loomed over Germany 's so called efficient model , the tag of ' second best ' ringing in the ears of players , management , the top brass as well as the distraught fans . Adding to the rot was the increasingly infamous brand of ' chokers ' that was being handed out to them by the media , after having lost their second Champions League final in the past 3 years at that stage . Everything was going wrong for them when it mattered most . <p> So what did Bayern do to overcome the ghosts of past season ? They did what they did best , i.e get down to the training ground and start with a clean slate . And as mentioned afore , Heynckes had a major hand in masterminding the revival . This is where Bayern 's German roots were most prominent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were hell bent on doing everything right this time out , with steely determination and a no-nonsense approach central to their approach . <p> " Osram " Jupp One of football 's most underrated geniuses <p> Heynckes ' first statement of intent for the season came when he signed on Claudio Pizarro , Dante , Mario Mandzukic and Javi Martinez early on in the transfer window . With the quartet joining Xherdan Shaqiri whose deal was finalised on a Bosman from FC Basel in the middle of the 2011-12 season , Bayern looked revitalised and more potent from the start . True , Bayern 's technical and scouting staff would have had a major say in finalising these players who came in , but at the end of the day it was the former Borussia Monchengladbach trainer who would approve the transfer . <p> In general opinion , the 5 transfers were absolute peaches on Jupp 's part . Mandzukic proved to be a more hard-working and persistent compatriot to the receding Mario Gomez . Xherdan Shaqiri provided able cover to Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery on the wings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was absolutely indispensible for the Bavarian giants in the latter half of the season because of Holger Badstuber 's injury on the eve of the winter break . Javi Martinez arguably was the last piece in Bayern 's midfield jigsaw puzzle , complimenting the likes of Bastian Schweinsteiger and Toni Kroos all season , giving them the freedom to roam . And lastly , Pizarro turned out to be a total revelation given his age , playing the role of super-goal-scoring-sub in the Bundesliga as well as Champions League . While everything clicked for the new recruits , one must give ample kudos to Heynckes for keeping this ' Hollywood ' cast happy all season with astute management and rotation . <p> Guardiola Who ? Heynckes went on with business as usual , unperturbed by the announcement of Pep 's arrival in January <p> It is expected of even the biggest clubs and institutions to buckle under the weight of expectation and pressure of redemption . But Bayern did anything but that . Beginning their voyage with a fitting 2-1 win over Dortmund in the DFB Super Cup , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all competitions . With some rare yet customary blips in the Bundesliga and Champions League group stages , Bayern went into the winter break on top of the league . The same trend followed in the Champions League group phase , with Bayern finishing above Valencia on goal difference . The first half of the season was absolutely spot on with Heynckes 's plan working seamlessly . <p> Then came the winter break . Followed by which was the announcement that Pep Guardiola would take over the reins from Heynckes at the end of the season . Now critics viewed this as a development that might go on to derail Bayern 's season . This was the period when Heycnkes made his differences with the people upstairs clear , slamming the timing of making Guardiola 's arrival public . <p> The man who is nicknamed ' Osram ' after the German lighting manufacturer for his tendency to redden up like a bulb in heady situations , was at his ferocious worst at that juncture in time . But like on countless occasions in the past , Heynckes ' professionalism was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his side went on with business as usual on the pitch , living in the present rather than think about what next season might be like . Massive appreciation to Herr Jupp for the way he conducted himself and his side at that point . <p> Transfer Guru Heynckes ' signings this season were apt and fit into the system with ease <p> The result come April 6th was that Bayern had successfully wrestled the Bundesliga title back from Dortmund with 5 games to spare . They ended up doing it in style , by notching up 91 points from the regulation 34 games , a record total . It was one down , three to go at that stage . With that outcome , they went into the Champions League quarter-final showdown against Juventus gung-ho . Having been handed a scare by Arsenal in the previous round , Bayern went in with their shields , and came out 4-0 winners on aggregate . This was not it , they went on to beat Barcelona 7-0 on aggregate in the semis , as the result went on to rubber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with Heynckes right in the center of it all as the genius who had scripted Bayern 's comeback trail . <p> Employing approaches that mirrored their oppositions in Juventus and Barcelona , Heynckes in a way gave these two superpowers a taste of their own medicines . He overcame these two technically sound outfits with a ploy of his own , outclassing them by winning the key battles all over the pitch . There was no answer to Bayern 's strongarming tactics as they made a date with their perpetual foes Borussia Dortmund in the final of Europe 's elite competition . <p> This proved to be a completely different ballgame with the domestic flavour adding a new spice to the epic finale . Bayern rode their luck and weathered the Ruhr storm provided by Jurgen Klopp 's men . One got the feeling that Jupp had done as much as he could have this season , with fate left to decide this one for Bayern after years of choking and misery in the final stages . In the end , it proved to be third time lucky for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 89th minute following goals from Mario Mandzukic and Ilkay Gundogan . <p> Heynckes ' tactical acumen and insatiable hunger for success was instrumental in wrestling back the Bundesliga and winning the Champions League , at long last ! <p> Here are the words , right from the horse 's mouth as Heynckes revealed after lifting his second Champions League title , his first coming with Real Madrid way back in 1998 . " Since one year ago , we improved and improved . We modified so many details . I was stricter and more consequent with the details . I have to say , the players followed and there is harmony . You have to keep the players happy . Nobody wants to sit on the bench . Everyone wants to play " , he recounted . <p> Thus in many ways this is Jupp Heynckes ' best season as a player or a manager . Having already won numerous accolades in a glittering career , this season 's triumphs and achievements have a feeling of satisfaction and relief which he might not have experienced before . He is among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from him rather cruelly , which only inspired him and made him hungrier to turn it around and redeem himself this time out , with the treble almost in sight with Stuttgart left to topple at Olympiastadion in the Cup final on June 1 . He is undoubtedly a class apart . <p> Lastly , this is what the legend who has been managing since for the last 34 years had to say on his future : " The decision on what I will do after the cup match ( against Stuttgart next Saturday ) was already taken last June ? Retire ? No , you will learn about all that only after the cup final ! " <p> Tribute to this legend 's insatiable hunger for the game .

@@289237 <p> Tuberculosis is an underrated killer , on an average , it takes the lives of 904 people a day or 37 people every hour in India . The World Health Organization says India accounts for one-fifth of the global TB incidence . Each year , nearly 20 lakh people in India develop TB , of which around 8.7 lakh are infectious cases . <p> At government and private levels , many measures have been initiated to control the infection and mortality . There is a single vaccine called Bacille Calmette Guerin , or BCG , that insulates children from most types of TB . <p> But , tackling the disease in adults has proved to be a big challenge . Though they go in for a six-month course of four antimicrobial drugs , the treatment involves around 40 visits to the clinic during the period . Since after a few weeks of starting the medication , patients feel better , many discontinue the treatment . Some are plainly ignorant about the need to take the full course , others are careless and cite ' busy with work ' as a reason . The patients who do n't go the full hog , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of the disease . <p> Biometric Monitoring System <p> A solution for this huge challenge of tracking patients has come from Microsoft Research India ( MSR ) , the wing of the internet company that explores the role of technology in advancing socio-economic development for low-income communities . It 's the Biometric Monitoring System , a tamper-proof , infallible mechanism that would keep track of the patients ' medication , developed by Microsoft lead researcher Bill Thies . <p> " It 's important for patients to come to clinics to take the medication under the supervision of health workers . It 's called Directly Observed Therapy , " says Thies , who had been working on technologies for fighting TB even before joining Microsoft . <p> For the implementation of the monitoring system , MSR is coordinating with Operation Asha , one of the largest NGOs working in the prevention of TB . Dr Shelly Batra , co-founder of the NGO , says the social stigma is wrecking lives . " Hundreds of thousands of children are thrown out of school because they have got TB and nobody wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become child laborers if a wage-earning parent has got TB . " <p> How it works <p> The Biometric Monitoring System comprises a netbook computer to maintain patient records , a biometric fingerprint reader to record patients ' identities , and an attached cell phone ( or GSM modem ) to upload the log of visitors via SMS to a central location . <p> " On each visit , patients scan their finger . If they come as scheduled , their visit is recorded on the system and relayed to the central office . If they miss a visit , the system sends an SMS notification to their health worker and program managers . This enables health workers to follow up with timely and targeted counselling for any patients who miss a dose , ensuring that they do not fall off the course of medication , " says Thies . <p> The system is active in over 40 clinics in Delhi , Mumbai and Jaipur , and has reached over 3,000 patients . " In cooperation with Operation Asha , we are extending the system to track HIV medications as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to track attendance at women 's health camps in Bangalore , " he says . <p> The biometric system also has applications beyond tuberculosis . For example , the technology has been used to monitor whether sex workers in Bangalore are attending support programs to ensure their health and safety . In addition , the Uganda health ministry is adapting the technology to monitor doses of antiviral drugs in the treatment of HIV/AIDS . <p> Development projects <p> MSR India , which began operations in January 1995 in Bangalore , has about 55 full-time employees , and also hosts numerous interns throughout the year . Most of the lab concentrates on core computer science research topics , such as software engineering , systems and networking , and algorithms . The Technology for Emerging Markets group has 9 full-time members currently . In the summer , the number almost doubles , thanks to the numerous interns from within India and abroad . <p> Bill Thies says most of the projects pertain to domains of development , spanning health , education , finance , agriculture , and other areas . Projects are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and urban slums . <p> " For that some of the members of our group have moved to a village and lived there for months at a time .

We then return to the lab and see if we can invent , adapt or apply a technology to help solve that problem . We design solutions and refine them in cooperation with field partners . We also evaluate the solution , and quantify potential impact on the beneficiaries , " explains Thies . <p> Though the underlying technology is the easiest part to get right , sustaining sustaining it in a resource-poor environment , and ensuring that it has the envisioned impact , is not an easy task , says Thies . <p> " For example , in our TB project , there was difficulty scanning fingerprints for adult labourers who had heavily calloused fingers . We adopted a protocol where the finger was cleaned ( with a damp sponge ) prior to scanning , and each scan was taken twice in order to increase the accuracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Second , there were a handful of patients who were hesitant to provide their thumb print , as it had been used previously for financial transactions .

Catastrophic flash floods in Uttarakhand have taken the conflict between economic growth and ecological conservation to a new pitch . Photo : AP <p> Updated : Sun , Jun 23 2013. 09 09 PM IST <p> Catastrophic flash floods in Uttarakhand have taken the conflict between economic growth and ecological conservation to a new pitch . <p> Uttarakhand chief minister Vijay Bahuguna is making hapless attempts to defend his stand of opposing the notification of an eco-sensitive zone in the Bhagirathi valley . Environmental activists are feeling vindicated because some of their worst predictions have come true . <p> It would be fatal for the public discourse to remain stuck with a false choice between conservation and economic growth . Now , nothing less than a citizen 's assessment of future growth will break this logjam . <p> This is the conclusion I reached after an intensive six-day tour of more than 16 river valleys of Uttarakhand in early March . The tour was organized by Ravi Chopra , founder of a non-profit research organization in Dehradun called People 's Science Institute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundation that works on water and sanitation-related issues . <p> At Syalsaur on the banks of the Mandakini river , village activists described how their homes and water sources are being destabilized by blasting of tunnels for run-of-the-river hydel projects . Much of this region is also on seismic zone five , with high risks of earthquakes . <p> " There are many ways to generate electricity , " said Sushila Bhandari , an activist of the Nadi Bachao Abhiyan , whom we met at Syalsaur . " There is only one Mandakini and only one Alaknanda . Once damaged , these rivers will be lost forever . " <p> Within government and the private sector , this view is easily dismissed as romantic and out of sync with reality . Similarly , activists feel the builders of dams are blinded by growth mania and recklessly destroy the environmental base on which life and economy depend . <p> What then are possible points of intervention ? <p> First , most activists and environmental engineers are not asking for a complete hands-off approach to nature . Their plea is for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ecosystems can sustain . Secondly , there is now a substantial accumulation of knowledge , both traditional and modern , about ways of making optimal use of ecosystems , as opposed to extracting maximum benefits . <p> An optimal approach would use the same rivers to generate electricity , irrigate farms or supply water to towns , in ways that may alter but would not destroy the river 's microbiology and hydrology . Then both public planning and private sector investments would be designed on the principle of environmental flows , a concept that takes a more well-rounded view of the multiple functions of natural resources . The opposite of this is to see a river simply as a moving body of water that is wasted if it is not fully harnessed for human settlements or industry . <p> Thirdly , deciphering the difference between optimization and maximization is difficult , but not impossible . The technical dimension to this task , involving multiple disciplines from microbiology and botany to geology and soil sciences , will remain imprecise and a constant work in progress . <p> But these technical issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disagreement about what is our end goal . <p> Do we want growth now , for a decade or two , or for a more sustained period ? This question can not be processed either by ecologists or economists alone . The former would fight for more eco-reserves . The latter rejects many environmental concerns as being exaggerated . In this context , even mobilizing citizens to rise in defence of the environment is not enough . <p> Saving a few rivers in Uttarakhand , if at all possible , would be a temporary and illusory gain . Unless the definition of growth is itself re-examined and reconfigured , both sides could win a few battles now and jointly lose the war . In that case , we would neither save the environment nor have sustained growth across generations . This is why a citizens ' assessment is now an urgent imperative .

Viable solutions can only come from those who see ecology and economy as a continuum . <p> There is a new generation of both scientists and entrepreneurs who understand this . Many of these younger people are swept up in an excitement about social enterprise and innovation that combines social , environmental and business good . <p> There will surely be a surge of this energy in Uttarakhand as the reconstruction work begins .

That was when the then Ministry of Non-conventional Energy Sources began an exercise to collect wind data extensively across the country . After the exercise , the Ministry estimated the wind power potential of India at 45,000 MW . <p> Today , the country has 20,000 MW of wind capacity and the latest estimate of the potential is over ten times that capacity . <p> This journey was possible , thanks to policy initiatives . First , at a time when electricity generation was the Government 's preserve , the Government opened wind power to the private sector . It gave those who put up windmills the 100 per cent ' accelerated depreciation ' benefit -- a major tax saver . Besides , profits from wind-generated electricity were exempt from income tax for five years . <p> About five years back , distribution utilities were mandated to buy a portion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , facilitating those States that did not have possibilities of generating electricity from renewable sources was the renewable energy certificate , which could be traded . <h> Wind power <p> Regulators also specified feed-in tariffs -- favourable and higher tariffs -- to be paid to wind energy generators ; this made it attractive for investors to put in money . The Centre also came up with a generation-based incentive for wind energy projects . <p> Chennai-based company NEPC ( which had been looking at windmills for pumping water for agriculture ) entered into a joint venture with the Danish wind power major Micon for producing turbines in India . Its small , 250 kW machines were a huge success and this encouraged other manufacturers . All through the 1990s , companies such as NEPC-Micon , RRB-Vestas and Enercon good business . <p> Still , by the end of the 1997-98 , India 's wind power capacity was less than 1,000 MW . Almost all of it came because of the ' accelerated depreciation ' tax sop , so much so that detractors of wind energy dubbed the windmills as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has outgrown the ' depreciation ' mode .

Even though 90 per cent of the sales are with the top six of them , a solid manufacturing base exists today . While foreign companies such as Vestas , Gamesa and more recently GE and Siemens have come up , India 's home-grown Suzlon has emerged as one of the top ten global wind companies . Although the industry is going through a tough time at present , the general expectation is that another growth phase will begin next year , when a couple of key incentives which were withdrawn , will be brought back . <h> Solar power <p> The solar story in India begins in January 2008 .

In 2010 came the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission , with two notable features . For the first time , tariffs were determined by a bidding process .

Now , the Phase II of the JNNSM is about to begin with 750 MW being put up for bidding -- developers would bid for ' viability gap funds ' from the Central Government , against a fixed tariff of Rs 5.45 a unit . <p> Apart from these , the JNNSM mandated local content requirements , which is now a subject of a debate . A solar manufacturing industry has developed , with a capacity of 2,000 MW for modules and 1,000 MW for cells ( cells are made into modules ) . <p> A large EPC industry has emerged -- a number of companies are now in the business of building solar power projects for others . <p> ' Social solar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inexpensive solar projects can power villages .

@@357233 <h> Indian biotech 's tough regulatory encounter <p> Biotechnology 's tryst with Indian agriculture has been a tumultuous affair so far but the current crisis appears to be its darkest phase . The latest salvo came last week from the environment ministry , which overruled the decision of the genetic engineering approval committee ( GEAC ) , India 's apex biotech authority , to allow field trials of genetically modified ( GM ) crops . This followed a sustained campaign by a small band of anti-GM activists , who have deemed GM crops unsafe without even a shred of supporting evidence . <p> The ministry 's decision highlights the extraordinary influence of anti-GM activists on national policies . It also underscores the limited powers of GEAC , and the urgent need for an independent and credible biotech regulator in the country . The Biotechnology Regulatory Authority of India ( BRAI ) Bill , currently pending in Parliament , promises to set up just such a body .

The genesis of the problem lies in the very nature of GEAC . Originally intended to be a technically competent body to deal with issues of bio-safety , it was turned into another bureaucratic committee . Its credibility was undermined further when issues relating to conflict of interest were brushed under the carpet . GEAC 's committee-like structure and its acceptance of trial results furnished by technology companies put a bigger question mark on its effectiveness as a watchdog . <p> The weaknesses of our biotech establishment and regulatory institutions made them vulnerable to attacks from sundry NGOs .

Conventional breeding techniques can provide some , but not all solutions to the needs of our farmers . Rather than blindly opposing GM technology , we must actively encourage all agricultural innovations . Simultaneously , India must move to a regime of rigorous and independently conducted trials to settle questions of safety .

Vadivudaiyal was meditating when the whole village witnessed the downpour , and a glowing garland bedecked her . She was taken to Pasupatheeswarar temple where she merged with the lord .

Pugazh Chola became a Nayanmar later . The idols of Eripatha Nayanar , Pugazh Chola , Sambandar and emperor Muchukunda ( said to be a Chola king ) are found at the corners of the enclosure around flagstaff . At the north-west corner of the outer prakaram is the sannidhi for Shanmugar , who is seen with His consorts .

' , a report by IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics , the urban residents have access to 66 per cent of the total hospital beds available in India . <p> " Similarly , the distribution of healthcare workers , including doctors , nurses , and pharmacists , is highly concentrated in urban areas and the private sector , " it said . <p> As per the study , the physical accessibility of public or private healthcare facilities is a challenge in rural areas , it added . <p> In rural areas , to seek OPD treatment 32 per cent of rural respondents had to travel over 5 kms , while 68 per cent travelled less than 5 kms for the same . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 92 per cent travelled less than 5 kms to get OPD treatment , while only 8 per cent travelled more than 5 kms . <p> The study also said cost of treatment at private healthcare facilities is between two and nine times higher than at public facilities . <p> It , however , said a 40-45 per cent reduction in out-of- pocket expenditure for both outpatient and inpatient treatments can be attained through a holistic approach addressing four critical , interrelated dimensions of healthcare access . <p> The critical areas are physical accessibility of healthcare facilities , availability and capacity of the resources , quality and functionality of service and affordability of treatment , it pointed out . <p> Commenting on the finding , IMS Health Information and Consulting Services India Pvt Ltd Managing Director , South Asia , Amit Backliwal told PTI : " There is a misconception that access is equal to affordability .

@@401237 <h> Canon EOS 700D review <p> by Gagandeep Singh Sapra , 19 July 2013 <p> Canon EOS 700D review <p> Canon EOS 700D is the ' flagship ' device in company 's entry-level consumer DSLR range . Canon has included some creative features as well as a very responsive capacitive touchscreen to make sure this camera appeals to first time users as well as those looking for an upgrade . Bundled with the camera is the 18-55 f/3.5-5.6 stock lens . So how does it work , let 's find out . <p> In the box <p> Canon EOS 700D body <p> LP-E8 rechargeable battery <p> AC adapter kit ACK-E8 <p> Manual <p> Warranty card <p> USB cable <p> Hand strap <p> 512MB SD Card <p> Software CD <p> Canon EF 18-55 f/3.5-5.6 lenses <p> Build/ Design <p> The first thing you notice about the 700D is its petite frame , slightly smaller than the previous generations and much lighter when it comes to weight of the body alone . Canon EOS 700D is one of the lightest DSLR cameras that I have come across , slightly smaller than most entry-level DSLR cameras , and lighter , at just 580 grams for the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bundled kit lens adds another 200 grams to this , making it pretty light to carry around on a holiday or a trek . The body is made of stainless steel covered in polycarbonate resin and glass fibre making it durable to take on the challenges of day to day photography . The controls are well placed and easily accessible , and the 180 degree tilt touchscreen is bright , responsive and full of detail . <p> I also liked the fact that the card slot is on the side and not at the bottom . This means you easily swap out the card when you have the camera mounted on a tripod . The bottom part of the camera has just the battery slot and tripod mount , while the front of the camera has no buttons or controls . <p> On the top side of the Canon EOS 700D , over the grip , you have the shutter button , the Aperture and Shutter control dial , ISO Button , a Mode Dial , and three-position toggle on-off switch , that switches off power , switches it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top , next to the hot shoe are the built-in stereo microphones , and the pop-up flash . <p> On the back are your usual buttons , including a D-Pad that lets you choose between white-balance , multiple shots and AF Mode . A big advantage with the camera is that all the settings are clearly visible on the big 3-inch vari-angle touchscreen LCD , so if you do n't know how to move around using the buttons , you can always touch the screen to get to the setting you are looking for . There is also a dedicated button that shuts off the LCD and switches to the viewfinder . <p> What is nice to see is that though all functions and settings of the camera can be accessed via the touchscreen , Canon has still included the buttons that let you scroll through the settings , which come in particularly handy if you are an experienced Canon user who 's gotten used to things being a certain way . <p> Features / Performance <p> As I mentioned earlier , Canon likes to call the 700D its flagship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tests , including late night handheld street photography and some light blurs , and , overall , the camera performed very well for an entry-level DSLR . <p> The Camera can shoot JPEG and RAW Images , and also save both of them , though remember that if you choose to save images as RAW ( or indeed both ) , you are advised to have a faster card , else you 'll have a bottleneck while taking shots . <p> It was also good to note that the lens Canon is now including in the kit is image-stabilised and is the new avatar of its entry-level lens , giving you a good control on image stability both in video and still mode . There is no built-in GPS but the camera can take an optional GPS-E2 unit if you need GPS functionality . <p> The Canon EOS 700D does not charge via USB so you need to take the battery out and use the supplied charger . The battery lasts you anywhere between 400 and 440 shots , so if you are a light use photographer out for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charger behind , but in most cases you will need to carry it along with you . <p> Focus System <p> The Canon EOS 700D features a smartphone like interface , that lets you touch the screen to indicate the area you want to focus on while taking pictures and videos , which gives you more control than the traditional autofocus points . <p> The camera , though an upgrade on its predecessors , the Canon 600D and Canon 650D , does not seem to have an in-body improvement on the focussing system , but the bundled 18-55 kit lens from Canon now has a stepper motor that does a much faster autofocus , which makes the 700D seem faster than the earlier generation cameras . I usually do n't recommend buying a DSLR with the kit lens , and , instead , buying lenses that you want to use , but the kit lens Canon includes is very agile , and silent , which comes in especially handy while shooting videos . The 700D also has predictive autofocus . <p> The sensor on the 700D has 9 cross-type AF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LCD when using live view mode and on the view finder when shooting . You can switch to manual focus by toggling the switch on the lens . <p> My big peeve though is the viewfinder on the Canon EOS 700D . I understand that this is an entry-level camera , but since this is an upgrade from the previous generation , I would have liked Canon to make the view finder brighter than what we 've seen before . At times I was worried if the photos that I am taking are properly composed and had to overcompensate with settings . <p> Image Quality <p> I have been using a very high-end DSLR as my primary camera for about a year now , so I did n't have high expectations from the entry-level Canon EOS 700D , but the image quality on the camera was surprisingly good . <p> Most of the low-light photos taken with the kit lens were shot anywhere between ISO 800 and ISO 1600 , and I was worried about the images being slightly noisy . However , the camera handled these very well and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3200 did show a bit of noise . If you want , you can take up ISO Settings up to 12,800 in the snapshot mode and 6400 in video mode , but I would really not recommend that . Canon also let us use their prime 28mm f/1.8 lens for some shots , and I was very happy with the way this worked . <p> The Canon EOS 700D performed well in most situations , indoors as well as outdoors , and the lens also kept up with it . A few shots in the gallery were taken with the prime lens , specifically for getting the lights to look like stars , but with the bundled 18-55 lens too I managed to get some interesting shots . <p> I am no fan of the on-body flash on any camera , and typically use a higher ISO and a lower shutter speed to achieve a better low light capture . However , at times you need the flash to freeze the moment , and just to capture things without changing settings . I loved the fact that Canon has included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This means you can turn off the flash fully , or you can go to the auto mode where the flash will automatically popup . I took a few street pictures with the flash on , and got some good fill results , which was good - there was no burning of faces and/ or over-lighting of the scene . <p> The camera also supports a 5 frames per second shooting mode . I took some street shots of cars whizzing past the Shinlin Night market in Taipei , and the scenes were nicely captured . <p> From dawn to dusk , I took about 50 pictures with the camera using various settings , indoors , low-light areas , and brightly lit neon signs , and the camera performed well for an entry-level DSLR in all scenarios . I understand why Canon likes to call the 700D its flagship entry-level DSLR . <p> Video <p> One of the things that stood out for me when I had read the Canon EOS 700D press release of the new kit lens was the silent motor , and I really wanted to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the autofocus , you usually get the motor 's hum , and then have to come back and edit that out in the movie . <p> I took the camera out to shoot a small movie and the camera performed well . It was able to pick up sounds clearly and with the on-board stereo microphones , the quality of sound was very good , and yes , the motor was silent compared to the earlier generations . The 700D also supports external microphones ( to be purchased separately ) . <p> Battery Life <p> The battery on the Canon EOS 700D is rated at 400 shots and my testing gave similar results . On a four day trip across Hong Kong and Taipei , I did not need to charge the battery once , even though I was shot videos and a number of delayed-shutter shots , which can be battery intensive . The LP-E8 is the same battery that shipped in the previous generations , hence getting a spare battery is not an expensive affair in case you propose to shoot a lot of pictures . <p> Verdict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 700D , especially when I realised that nothing much had changed in the body of the camera from the previous generation . However , the new menu and the kit lens did capture my attention , and once I started using the camera , it came out with flying colours . <p> Right now , the 700D is one of the lightest DSLR cameras around , and it was really nice slinging it along on the trip . The new interface that Canon has built combined with the very responsive capacitive touchscreen were great to use . I was surprised to see myself play with the settings on the touchscreen rather than go through clunky menus with the buttons , even though I 'm used to the latter . It was also nice to see an auto mode that disables flash . <p> What really bothered me , however , is the viewfinder brightness , which takes some getting used to . You need to make sure you are not over compensating for images based on what you see on the screen . On the first few shots my settings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different camera , but after the first few shots , things were much better . <p> Those relatively minor issues aside , the Canon EOS 700D is a very good overall package . Though I 'm usually not a fan of kit lenses as I said before , if you are thinking of buying the 700D , I strongly recommend you pick up the body plus kit lens combo , as the 18-55 is good value for Rs. 6,000 extra .

I am very proud and grateful to have received the invitation and to be here amongst so many cricket legends and lovers . So , I stand before the cricketing faithful , a very humble and lucky man . We do live in interesting times and in the middle of an Ashes series as a former umpire and given my role with the ICC , I also stand before you as somewhat of a target ! So , as always , I think I 'm prepared for anything , so take your best shot . <p> I would like to acknowledge the presence of my wife , Helen . Without her love and support , I would not have been able to explore the opportunities afforded by this game and yes , behind a great man is an even greater woman . Helen is no different to all the other " cricketing widows " who are often given a lessor priority when the cricket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but a reflection on how highly we value our game and sport . You can see why it was a hard decision to move away from active umpiring but it was time to redress the balance and put more time and effort into our relationship and family . <p> Just on the topic of family - it must be said that I have two families , my cricket family and my paternal one . At this point , I 'd like to pay my own tribute to last year 's MCC Spirit of Cricket speaker , Tony Greig . He was a commentator and I was an umpire , so I suppose you could say that we did n't see eye to eye on everything . His untimely passing helped reinforce to myself what the true Spirit of Cricket is . Attending his memorial service at the SCG just before the traditional January Test , with both of his families present , it was so right that all present were there to remember , celebrate and pay their respects to such a servant of the game . As sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one is , cricket does have the power to bring different people together for the common good - the love and advancement of the game . I sincerely respect the work of Tony , his passion , his love and commitment to serve the game of cricket . We all come and go , but the legacy of our game carries on - as it should . <p> One of the key qualities an umpire must possess is humility - the ability to know and accept the role that we play within the game and ensure that we create the right environment for the players to perform and express their talents . Yes , we have an important role but it 's not the most important . It is , after all , a player 's game and always should be . <p> My story ( humility ) As with most stories , my umpiring one started with a bit of luck . I was lucky to be given the opportunity to attend the NSWCU&amp;SA training course and exam , lucky to get more than the required 85% pass mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the planet , lucky to have such great teachers and mentors around me through my career . It was a great environment with extraordinary people and as a result NSW and Australia have produced some fine umpires over my time . Simply put , I would not be here today if it was not for the great people surrounding me - family , friends , work mates , employers , cricket administrators , cricket captains and most importantly , fellow umpires . To pinch a quote from one our current ICC Umpire Coaches : " Umpiring is everyone 's business " . Everyone has a part to play in its future and success . <p> I loved playing cricket and I was a child who lived for Saturday mornings . When I woke up and saw raindrops on the window of my bedroom , it was a heavy feeling of disappointment . I was not the best player , not the worst , but like most things , I gave it my best effort and worked very hard to improve all the time . The pinnacle of my playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schoolboys side captained my Michael Slater with fellow team member ( and previous MCC Cowdrey lecturer ) Adam Gilchrist - two fine players and human beings . <p> As they say , when one door closes , another one opens and for me a back injury made me question and reassess my playing future . That 's when a good friend of mine talked me into joining him for the umpiring course . We thought we knew the Laws as players and this was going to be a breeze - the educators up the front had seen our type before and put us through our paces . Was 42 Laws over four nights and intermittent study the basis for being an umpire and having the right to send batsmen on their way ? Apparently it was ! The written exam was passed and so technically I knew the Laws well enough , but what the game has taught me over many years , I can only scratch the surface in this small amount of time . Today , it continues to pay a full time wage and I continue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Club , where the Bradman Museum and International Cricket Hall of Fame is located , and right through to the highest level with the top umpires and players in the world . How lucky am I ? <p> The central theme is respect . From 1744 , when the Laws of Cricket were first codified , through to today and into the future , my desire is for that central value of respect to remain as a constant . <p> So what does the Spirit of Cricket mean to me ? First , the central theme is respect . From 1744 , when the Laws of Cricket were first codified , through to today and into the future , my desire is for that central value of respect to remain as a constant . The game has changed over the past two and a half centuries , and it will continue to change , but it is vital that some things remain constant ; they being the values of respect , the basis of fair play and a balanced contest between bat and ball . We need to learn from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assess the present ( celebrate the moment ) and be visionary for the future . <p> Let 's look at respect for the past Cricket has established some great traditions that make it a unique sport . Many of our common values have been centred on such colloquial expressions like " it 's just not cricket " - relating to fairness - " a gentleman 's game " - relating to honour and respect amongst competitors and doing the right thing when required - " spirit of cricket " - even though something might be technically right , applying a high standard of morals and integrity when playing - not to engage in cheating or taking undue advantage of someone else 's misfortune . <p> Then we have the conventions of the game that have been established over time . Today , we continue to respect those traditional conventions when we start plying our trade . As umpires we are the first to walk on to the field and the last ones to walk off - spare a thought for us at the tea break or innings break in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a break . ( No , I do n't expect any sympathy here ! ) . When only one umpire is present at a game of cricket , we are expected to officiate at both ends with the support of a stand in ( normally a player ) at square leg . We normally collect the bowler 's hat and carry it for the over in progress - some of you may not think this is much of a service , but no doubt many of you have not had to hold the sweaty , soaked and unlaundered hats belonging to players like Greg Matthews , Anil Kumble or Chaminda Vaas . <p> I started umpiring in the early 1990s just when third umpires were brought in for line decisions and recall the huge outcry when batsmen were now being given out run out or stumped by one or two centimeters . It was also an age when there was one home Board-appointed and one ICC-appointed umpire to be in the middle for Tests . My Test career started with being appointed by the ACB as they were called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the MCG - to represent your country and your profession at the highest level is the ultimate . There were no ICC contracts , no ball trackers , no hot spot , no Twenty20 cricket and no international umpire training workshops . The uniform was basic , I supplied my own white business shirt and the Match Referee ( Mr. AC Smith ) gave me some National Grid stickers to apply to my shirt for each day 's play on behalf of our sponsor . My partner for the Test was Venkat and our teamwork was summarized by our chat as we walked out to start the match when I asked him , " which ends shall we go to ? " and he replied , " I do n't care which end you want , but I 'm going to that end ! " <p> Let 's look at Respect for the present In today 's cricket , the use of technology has shown how difficult the job of an umpire is . In most TV broadcasts , there are around 32 cameras to capture the action of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between wickets and fielders catching the ball close to the turf or trying to slide and prevent boundaries up to 80 meters away . Every movement of the player is under the microscope ( on and off the field ) and every movement of the umpire is also under intense scrutiny . <p> There is at least one camera on the umpire all the time , every ball , watching his every move and facial expression , waiting to capture his decision for all to see ( and be replayed as many times as the director sees fit ) . In today 's cricket , the decision of the umpire is scrutinized by all these cameras including slow motion , ultra motion , Hot Spot front on , Hot Spot leg side , Hot Spot off side , ball tracking and prediction , Snicko , stump audio , the mat and then by up to three commentary experts upstairs in the box . After all that public scrutiny and technology , there is often divided opinion about what the correct decision was - was he out or was he not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , high-speed frame rates , computer software programs and military infra-red technology , plus high definition broadcasting has certainly given the spectator and participants a lot more information - there is no doubt we now have a lot more " armchair " experts in cricket ! Today , everyone umpires the game by watching television . <p> The invasive nature of this broadcasting has a double edge to it - it does put more pressure on players and umpires . Not too much now happens on a cricket field that is not captured by a camera , a microphone or piece of technology . This has the ability to bring out the best in the game and also the worst . We can appreciate the skills and high standards on display . A great switch hit in ultra slow motion off a pace bowler by AB De Villiers or Kevin Pietersen , a magnificent mystery ball out of the front of the hand from Narine or Ashwin , a superb diving catch taken millimeters off the ground by Jacques Kallis and the scenes of celebration when the last wicket has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how good the umpiring standards are and how good some of the decisions can be - the small inside edge before the ball hits the pads for a not out lbw , the flick of the glove down the leg side for a catch and confirmation of no edge for a tough bat/pad appeal with lots of dust flying as the batsman hits the ground with his bat . <p> Secondly , the Spirit of Cricket to me means that the values of the game take priority over personal gain or advancement . As you would have seen in that collage of pictures , there are so many facets and stakeholders in the game . When these people or groups interact within the game of cricket , the spirit of cricket to me means that they do the right thing to promote and serve the game . They should add value and contribute . Our game is strong due to the mix of a wide variety of talent and contribution of everyone involved . The collective intelligence of the group is always greater than that of the individual . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group is always greater than that of the individual . No single person has all the answers and solutions to the current challenges , so I 'm not going to stand here and pretend to tell you that I have them . The real strength lies in the processes of associations , cricket committees and governing bodies that operate under the rule of democracy . <p> The Spirit of Cricket to me means that the values of the game take priority over personal gain or advancement . <p> Debating difficult topics in the public domain is perhaps not the best way to solve our current challenges as they can sometimes be limited debates according to only a few people 's viewpoints . It is also difficult to put all the facts on the table and consider all the options and compromises involved . There is rarely a perfect solution to any problem or challenge - inevitably there is always compromise . The fact is , our game is stronger and more vibrant today than it was 30 years ago when I first played cricket . It is stronger today than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The one constant in our world is change . We need to embrace change in our game and be careful about how we shape the game and ensure that every time we change something , we are adding value while balancing the benefits against the costs . Umpires are a unique breed of individual , we think differently - the job demands it as we have to deal with the facts and not the emotions . I 'm not staying that we are strange , some might say so based on standing in the hot sun for over six hours a day , absorbing the pressure , being booed when we come off for bad light and having to concentrate over long periods of time . We do think differently . Whenever we look at a situation like weather , ground conditions , player behaviour , an appeal for example , we have to consider what the Law says and apply it in a fair , unbiased , accurate and consistent way . Remember , umpires do n't care which team wins the game . <p> When Inzaman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incident generated lots of debate at the time ( and probably still does ? ) . We almost had to order in a tow truck to remove Inzi and Bob Woolmer from our dressing room after the day 's play as they would initially not accept the decision or application of the Law . All we did was apply the Law in a fair , unbiased and accurate way . The fact that it was the Pakistan captain at home in an important game , in a tight match had no bearing on the thought process . Our job is to make decisions and provide justice for all . <p> Decision making is tough in today 's game ; in my opinion tougher than when I started umpiring 22 years ago . Why ? Because more people see evidence that we may not get to see on the ground at the time . There is more at stake when teams play - prize money , player contracts , support staff contracts and expectations of supporters and sponsors . Anyone who watches the game at the ground , on the giant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every decision of the umpires ' and also make an overall judgment of their performance on the day ( or even on their capabilities in general - often with only having seen a very small sample of an umpire 's performance ) . I can tell you that ICC has taken the performance assessment of umpires very seriously as our rankings and continued contractual offerings depend on it . Every appeal is logged by the ICC Match Referee , every appeal is reviewed in the office and is assessed into three categories - correct , incorrect or inconclusive . Should the decision be assessed as inconclusive , the umpire is marked with only 50% of a correct decision ( not sure I agree with this but it may surprise you to know that I do n't always get my way with ICC management ! ! ) . There is no benefit of doubt to the umpire here ! <p> 2010/11 - 2745 appeals answered with a CD% average of 93.79% ( umpires ranged from 97.29% to 91.6% ) <p> 2011/12 - 2597 appeals answered with a CD% average of 95.05% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - 2956 appeals were answered with a CD% average of 94% ( umpires ranged from 96.39% to 90.63% ) <p> There is a rider here though ; umpiring is not just about decision making . The danger is that we only assess or make judgments about an umpire or umpiring standards according to their correct decision percentage . Umpiring is much more than that - I would prefer to focus on preparation , match management , field craft ( technique ) , communication , teamwork - an overall ability of an umpire to solve problems before they happen and create an environment of fairness for the players where they can play freely and show their skills . Correct decision making is important but for me it is a given , it should be there as a matter of fact . Only by exception should it be considered as an area to analyse and critique . For me , if you excel in preparation , match management , focus , teamwork and mental strength , the decision making will take care of itself . <p> If you were to ask the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would they be happy with an umpire who got nine out of ten decisions right in a day 's play - I 'm very confident the answer would be " yes " . The reality is , this is not the response when an umpire gets one wrong ( or should I say , not proved right by technology ? ! ) . Remember we are competing with many cameras and technologies and sometimes we are not in the best position to see or hear what actually happened . We have higher standards as umpires and there is always a strong desire and pursuit to get all decisions correct . I have n't met an umpire yet who is comfortable to make an error on the field or who does n't want to get all of his decisions right - we really do care about our role and our decisions and performance . <p> Personally , I would set tour and game goals , just like the players do and strive to achieve them . I take enormous personal pride in every opportunity and performance in front of me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and expectations , it hurts . When I have met or exceeded them , it feels great.As I said , the current environment has shown how difficult the role of an umpire is and perhaps has increased the respect for role and skills of the position . I honestly feel that respect for the role of the umpire has improved as people can now see how good we are and indeed , how tough the job can be . <p> Upon considering my own role in the game , I came to the conclusion that there was more to offer in a coaching , development and support than in active umpiring alone . <p> Today 's umpire has much more to do that just administer justice on decisions of dismissals . We have to police ( and I personally dislike this term and approach ) other vital areas of the modern game such as player behaviour , ball tampering , over rates , logos and clothing , impact of ground , weather and light having to reduce playing times . <p> As I said up front , the spirit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As umpires we need to respect the process from the governing body of how the game is shaped and the role of technology . Remember the collective intelligence of the group is greater than the individual . Our technology system is not perfect and as I said one of the key roles of an umpire is to deliver justice when someone has infringed the agreed Laws . <p> One benefit of the current technology system has been the reduction in player behaviour , dissent charges and improvement in behaviour accordingly on the field . In the majority of cases in the modern game , if an umpire has made an error , there is an ability to correct it . In an Ashes Test , if there is an error off the first ball of the game , it can be corrected at the time rather than have it on the umpire 's conscience for the rest of the day and have the players remind him constantly him of it . If I make an error , it stays with me all day , all game and I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no dressing room to immediately take refuge while another umpire comes out to the middle , no time off the field to regather thoughts and regroup . <p> Players and the game deserve the highest standards of umpiring and they deserve justice ( at all levels ) . We also have to apply our values and spirit of cricket at all levels . Please allow me to illustrate this point with a personal story from a match that happened earlier this year . <p> I do n't normally umpire my children 's cricket matches , in fact when they are looking for an umpire , I normally take a few steps backwards and pretend not to hear the request . I suppose it 's a combination of not wanting to either embarrass myself , or have to deal with a conflict of interest if my son is involved in a decision and also the fact that I would just like to sit and enjoy watching my child in action . Now , I took my eldest son Harry ( who was 13 at the time ) one Saturday morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bowral . You guessed it , I was roped in to umpiring for his team as no one else was there who could do it - or wanted to do it . So , I was thrown the poor excuse for a counter ( yes , I am very particular about my tools ) and off I went . <p> I was doing okay and did not have too many five-ball overs with the poor counter , when I found my son Harry handing me his cap as he came on to bowl . Harry 's not a bad bowler , a bit like Terry Alderman , with natural outswing . Within an over , Harry and the keeper went up for a huge lbw appeal on a rather large kid and I shook my head and said " not out " . ( The fact that I could see all three stumps at the time made me pretty happy the decision was right but what would I know ? ) . Well , Harry did not agree and he proceeded to give me and everyone the big " T @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is this something new at the Under-14 level I thought . It did n't stop there , he then yelled out to his mother on the sideline - " I never want Dad to umpire me again ! " I was more than happy to comply with his latter request but took a serious objection to the former one of his dissent . How was I now going to handle this form of player behaviour I thought - where was the respect for the umpire 's decision ? We ended up having our own internal code of conduct hearing at home later on that day , the penalty was handed out and there was no chance of Harry sending it to further appeal . <p> The story does illustrate though , how our future generations and their values of our game are being shaped by what they see at the highest level . This is unavoidable . I believe the highest form of the game needs to have the highest standards of respect , spirit of cricket , behaviour and integrity - those at the highest level are setting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players , umpires or administrators . We owe the future of our game that much . <p> I do respect how the game is shaped and the role of technology . The technology genie has been let out of the bottle and it 's not going to go back in . I would simply advocate that we look at ways to be as pragmatic as possible so we can get more correct decisions and deliver more justice . I do have an important message on this topic though as it is often asked , " what is your view on the DRS ? " I 'm not sure that this is the right question . Perhaps we should be asking " are we using technology in the best way to serve the players , supporters , umpires and values of our game ? " No matter what system of technology review / referral we implement in our game , it will not be perfect or 100% . The all-human solution is not 100% , neither is the DRS and neither will be an " all appeals " review system . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It all depends how the majority believe our game should be played underpinned with the values we want to promote and preserve ( the spirit of cricket ) . <p> One performance improvement tip I have learned from speaking with Gary Kirsten , who I respect enormously as a person and for his coaching skill , is that we need to ask ourselves every day " are we doing this the best way ? Is there a better way ? " I would advocate applying this question to how we use technology in our sport as there is always room for improvement and we should always self-assess and strive for excellence , not perfection . <p> So , now to Respect for the future The playing control team ( we call it the PCT ) and the third team concept is an important one - not the most important but equally so when we consider the players . Whenever the game deals with issues like security , corruption , technology , hosting standards , Laws , Playing Conditions , scheduling/workloads and spirit of the game - we as umpires have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not seek to be more important than the other two teams , we the " third team " , seek to be treated as equally significant and respected for the role that we have to perform . If we expect our umpires and match officials to perform as professionals , then going forward , we need to set up a professional support structure and environment for them . Hopefully , this is where I can now play a role and serve the game better . <p> Cricket Australia and ICC have shown a lot of leadership here in particular in creating a professional relationship between the business and its umpires . Australian umpires were the first to be offered part time contracts back in 1998 . In the case of ICC , we entered into our first MOU in 2009 . Both Malcolm Speed and David Richardson deserve a lot of credit for their pioneering work and cooperation in this area . Being professional is not about how much money you are paid , but it 's more about creating the right environment of accountability , security and clarity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus on their core function . A contractual relationship is important for representative umpires and the top end of the game to flourish and to secure the best available . The top ICC Elite Panel umpires are travelling and working between 180 and 220 days per year with their own domestic season to participate in . For the top 12 and perhaps the best three or four of the International Panel , the workload is only manageable by having some financial and contractual security . <p> For international umpires , the role is not just one of on-field game management but there are other duties off field such as umpire development with local Boards , media and sponsor requests . The rise of domestic cricket leagues provides another time and work challenge but they also create a development opportunity for domestic umpires . These local umpires now get to work more often with international umpires and referees , which allows more transfer of skills and best practice examples in what essentially is an international environment under the scrutiny of TV and overseas players and coaches . <p> Many people have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I prefer to call it moving on to a different role . I have been umpiring for 22 years and nearly 14 of those at the international level , for me it was time to take on a new challenge . Apart from the " it 's time " argument , there were two fundamental reasons - personal and professional . I would like to focus on the professional reasons . We all are aware that the game of cricket is much larger than any one individual and we should all be reminded of one of Sir Donald Bradman 's key themes , and that is : " Play the game for the game 's sake , enjoy it and leave the game in a better position that when you found it " . <p> Upon considering my own role in the game , I came to the conclusion that there was more to offer in a coaching , development and support than in active umpiring alone . To date , most , if not all of our effective training has been " on the job " . We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prepare our umpires better before they walk into a game situation . That is a much better service to the players , stakeholders and the umpires . There is very little material or training tools to help prepare umpires for the increasing challenges of cricket umpiring ( especially at the representative level ) . Since joining international umpiring in 1999 , it was quickly established that the majority of knowledge and intellectual properties on umpiring still resided in people 's heads . <p> Training and coaching of umpires has primarily revolved around learning the MCC 's 42 Laws and assessment based on passing an exam with an acceptable agreed number of correct answers . Cricket umpiring is much more than that and my continued focus , right when the umpiring career began , was to make it easier and better for the current and future generations of cricket umpires . This is taking shape not only in the area of minimum hosting standards for match officials , contracts , payments and the like but also in training , accreditation and coaching resources . <p> It is vital to reinforce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administrators that there are three teams who participate in the game of cricket - the two teams who play to win and the third team who provide the service and on field management - the umpires ( and now match referees ) . At this time I would also like to acknowledge the importance and contribution of the scorers and ground staff to this third team - their work is equally essential and important . Hopefully one day , we can see a David Kendix or a Mick Hunt delivering a Cowdrey Lecture also ! <p> So , what does this service and contribution look like ? The game is changing all the time and is driven by the players and broadcasters . Umpiring is continually trying to catch up and keep pace with these developments . Laws and Playing Conditions change every year as a result . Many top umpires now officiate under no less than up to seven ( seven ) different types of playing conditions within a year , all with slight variations on interpretations from the relevant governing body . We need to make it easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We need to create a better way to educate , train and coach our umpires . Our work has started this year on developing an ICC Accreditation Process for International Umpires that the Test Playing Nations can also use for their first-class competitions with a target of having this implemented by 2015 . <p> We are seeking to establish and demonstrate best practice across six areas - technique , preparation , match management , decision making , attitude and teamwork and self-management/personal development . We have put in place a new coaching structure for international umpires - focusing on support and performance development and less on assessment . These ICC umpire coaches will need to reach down to the top domestic umpires and support the career path challenges for umpires . It 's a start but we need more quality umpire coaches and more funding for resources . We have recently conducted a " Coach the Coach " training course for the Test-playing nation 's future umpire coaches - this is first . This is a positive news story of leadership from the ICC and its Cricket Operations Department . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are training our future umpires before they get to representative levels - just like the players . We need to continually look for ways to improve performance and get decisions right in the first place . We want each umpire to be the best that they can be . <p> We are developing skill development training programs - trying to tap into the resources that the players have . These programs and tools have to be developed from scratch . Skill development activities have been created like accurate ball-pitching judgment , height judgment from square leg , third umpire communication and decision making and front foot no ball . Simulated based training exercises are the way forward . <p> MCC has a role to play as well . The Laws sub-committee requires resources to create a more modern , user-friendly and accessible support tool for understanding and interpreting the Laws of Cricket . We need to make use of the technological resources such as digital video clips , streaming on the internet and online Laws **28;575;TOOLONG . <p> This Ashes series highlights one significant challenge - that of succession planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elite Panel umpires are not eligible to officiate . That leaves us with only four umpires to control these ten Ashes Test matches - a significant workload and responsibility for these umpires and I 'm confident that they will do a fine job . It is also recognition for the way that Cricket Australia and the ECB recruit , train and develop their match officials . We have a real need to encourage and support the other Test-playing countries to invest more resources in this area . <p> Everyone seems to have an opinion on it but we need to alter the mindset and have all the countries investing more in the future of match officiating . <p> This representation trend by two countries needs more competition from the others . Umpiring is everyone 's business , everyone seems to have an opinion on it but we need to alter the mindset and have all the countries investing more in the future of match officiating . The best way to illustrate this point is through the balanced scorecard approach . We need all major elements of the game moving in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be of a high standard - I 'm referring to quality players , match officials , facilities , administration and financial management . If any of these areas is weak , then the quality of our game is compromised . All five areas need to be strong and of a high standard . <p> The Laws tell us that the " captains are responsible at all times for ensuring that play is conducted within the spirit and traditions of the game as well as within the Laws . " The future of our game shows us that our captains are getting younger and have less playing access to more experienced players , who are retiring earlier from the recreational game faster as life becomes more time challenged . Last year , I participated in a new concept by the Sydney Cricket Association where they held a " leadership " forum for all the Captains in Sydney grade cricket . Business and sports leaders presented their views and lessons learned on leadership , so that captains could self-assess their own leadership styles and abilities . We need to continue to support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry forward the spirit and traditions of our game . <p> Leadership and captaincy is just as important a skill in the game as an " off cutter " or " cover drive " . When cricket academies look at their programs , I 'd like to see modules on the spirit of cricket , mental strength , emotional intelligence , the Laws of the game , leadership skills and history of our sport . Umpiring is everyone 's business - we are the third team in the game . We seek equal consideration , we want to serve wholeheartedly and also have some fun out there . <p> So , in conclusion The spirit of cricket to me is about how best we all , individually , can serve the game - as a player , an umpire , a referee , a scorer , a grounds person , a commentator , a writer , a spectator , an administrator or a parent . We need to uphold the traditions and values of the game and carry forward that spirit by doing " the right thing " and putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future generations can experience what we have . <p> The game today does generate a lot of money , publicity , profile and opportunities for personal benefit . While it is fine to benefit from those opportunities , individuals and bodies need to also be aware of their responsibilities to keep reinvesting their time , profile and energies back into cricket - to reinvest back into the game , and remember where they came from . <p> I 'm sure everyone here today has been a volunteer to the game at some point . Volunteers are vital to any sport and our game is no different - they take the form of umpires and scorers at the grass roots level , helping out at the club ground with the covers or helping out at the clubhouse at the end of the days play . The club strength and game is what we all make it . I encourage everyone to get involved in the game in any way that you can as it has so much to offer . <p> Together , let 's make the game of cricket better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game 's heritage , enjoying and celebrating the present and creating more opportunities for our children - a legacy and future we can all be proud of .

@@411235 <p> The flip-flop on car fuel conservation standards is delaying standards for other vehicle segments like buses . The bus sector is already facing enormous fuel cost burden because of worsening fuel efficiency of buses . While CNG bus fuel efficiency in Delhi isstagnating , diesel bus fuel efficiency in other cities like Bengaluru are worsening . Increased fuel prices are compounding their operational costs <p> New Delhi July 24 , 2013 : While the Indian government is dreaming big on energy security , a nightmare scenario is unfolding which can shatter all its visions of energy independence -- the country 's transport sector is merrily guzzling fuel away . More than 40 per cent of the oil and oil products in the country go into running vehicles . In fact , if this guzzling continues unabated , it can virtually wipe out the gains of fuel savings from all other steps , and undermine all efforts at reducing climate change risks as enshrined in the National Climate Change Plan . <p> This emerged from the first day 's deliberations at an international workshop held here today on Vehicles : Taming emissions , fuel guzzling and warming . This workshop is part of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Centre for Science and Environment ( CSE ) . <p> Speaking at the workshop , Sunita Narain , director general , CSE said : " Even as the country faces the serious challenge of importing 94 per cent of its crude oil by 2030 , there is no serious effort to prepare a fuel saving roadmap for all modes of transport . Our oil import bill is already close to 7 per cent of the GDP . Import dependence has made India vulnerable to oil price shocks . At the same time , the ministry of environment and forests inventory shows that the transportation sector is the 4th largest emitter of heat trapping greenhouse gases in India while it remains the key emitter of toxics . Cities are becoming energy guzzlers and heat trappers -- in Delhi , the transport sector is responsible for close to half of all CO2 emissions . " <p> The CSE review of the current challenges and solutions has exposed the following . <p> * Delayed and lax proposal for fuel saving standards for cars is leading to enormous fuel loss : Even after negotiating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the standards have not been implemented . The approved Corporate Average Fuel Consumption Standards have laid down a target of 18.15 km/litre ( or 129.8 gm of CO2/km ) in 2015 and 20.79 km/litre ( or 113 gm of CO2/km ) in 2020 , after adjusting for increase in the average weight of the car fleet . Even these weak standards are being delayed for implemented in 2022 . India is the only vehicle producing region that has not set fuel economy targets . This has serious implications , given India 's dependence on imported crude oil and vulnerability of India 's economy to oil price vagaries . According to the International Energy Agency , future energy demand in India 's transport sector will be largely driven by cars , after the heavy duty segment . The total car fuel demand in 2030 will be more than the total road transport sector consumption in 2007 . It is not fair to incur enormous energy costs and suffer climate risks because of the use of personal vehicles . <p> * Any further delay will come at enormous energy cost : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2020 , then the country can get cumulative oil savings of only 95.9 metric tonnes of energy between 2010 and 2030 . But if the government insists on protecting the 2.8 per cent annual natural improvement in fuel economy achieved by industry between 2006 and 2010 and set the target at 104 CO2gm/km by 2020 , then cumulative oil savings can be 134 million metric tonnes of energy -- 1.3 times more than 96 million metric tonnes from delayed standards implementation . Delay in implementation will keep compounding fuel losses and increase the difference in cumulative savings between 2010 and 2035 . <p> * India will lose its advantage in the global race : India is starting the race from one of the best baselines in 2010 -- 141 gm of CO2/km . The European CO2 standard for cars for 2012 is 140 gm CO2/km . But Europe will leapfrog to 95 gm/km in 2020 . In fact , Europe has gone ahead and specified a target range of 68-78 g/km for cars in 2025 -- which is what the Indian two-wheelers meet today . It is ironical that both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Europe will have nearly halved the emissions by 2025 , while India would have cut it barely by 25 per cent . <p> * Bus -- poor fuel economy of buses adding to cost burden : Fuel economy standards for other vehicle segments are also getting delayed . Nearly all bus transport corporations are reporting either stagnation or decline in fuel economy of their fleets . In Delhi , the fuel economy of CNG buses is stagnating . Buses are bigger , more powerful with higher torque and there is no fuel economy standard for them . This costs huge money to the bus companies . There is also a need for improved bus operations to cut operational fuel losses . Idling , frequent acceleration and deceleration on congested roads can also affect fuel efficiency . A recent study by CAI Asia shows that by reducing idling by 10 minutes , the Bangalore transport corporation can save 100 litres per bus or Rs 3 crore annually . Also , with the help of improved drivers training and maintenance of the fleet , a saving of Rs 23 crore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carbon emissions from diesel vehicles for warming : The quality of diesel fuel and technology available in India is not a climate winner . So far known for toxic and cancerous particulate emissions , diesel vehicles are now being blamed for increasing global warming impacts -- studies show that diesel black carbon emissions are heat absorbing . Therefore , reducing black carbon from diesel vehicles gives both climate and public health benefits . <p> * Diesel 's CO2 benefits are also negated : Comparatively lower CO2 emissions from diesel vehicles compared to petrol vehicles also gets negated . A litre of diesel fuel has more carbon content than a litre of petrol . If more diesel fuel is burnt , more CO2 will be emitted . India urgently needs near-zero sulphur diesel and particulate traps to eliminate toxic and heat-trapping black carbon . This co-benefit of clean diesel must be accounted for in the technology roadmap . <p> * Dieselisation is increasing the weight of the car fleet and leading to more guzzling : With the explosive increase in car numbers and gradual increase in average weight of the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the weight of average car fleet is increasing , it is undoing fuel saving gains . Average weight and engine size during 2009-10 and 2012-13 has increased by 6 per cent . The weight and size of new vehicles is increasing at a rate of 2 per cent a year . Due to these trends , fuel economy ( km/litre ) has stagnated and even declined by 1 per cent during the same period . This is unacceptable when the country is rapidly motorizing and reeling under energy crisis . <p> * Bigger engines guzzle more fuel . In 2009-10 , diesel cars were 36 per cent of the new car sales . This has increased to more than 50 per cent of the new car sales in 2012-13 . Diesel is pushing the market towards bigger cars and SUVs that guzzle more fuel , and undermines fuel efficiency advantages of small cars . High petrol prices have kept the bulk of the petrol car sales -- as much as 87 per cent -- below the 1200 cc engine . But more than 40 per cent of diesel cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ segment registered a 41 per cent growth rate . This trend will explode . Estimates from other ongoing studies have shown that the current shifts towards bigger cars and SUVs and growing dieselization can lead to a cumulative loss of 6.5 mtoe of energy between 2010 and 2020 . This equals the fuel use of all four-wheeled passenger vehicles in 2006 -- around 6.6 mtoe . Therefore , the new fuel economy standards should have built-in safeguards to attain effective fuel economy improvement by 2015 and 2020 that will offset the impact of increased weight of the fleet . <p> * Railways to roadways -- need a balance : Adding to this complex challenge is the continuous shift of freight traffic from railways to the roadways . Railways ' share in freight traffic in India is close to 30 per cent . In case of passenger transport , the share of rail is as low as 15 per cent . Estimates say that in India , the transportation energy demand could grow even faster than anticipated , if all of the new highway projects currently under consideration are completed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rail on diesel per net tonne kilometer . We need a balance to promote rail-based mobility for long-range travel as it is more efficient than road . <p> * Need roadmap for aviation too : The Indian civil aviation sector has witnessed a growth rate of about 40 per cent annually ( 2008-09 to 2009-10 ) . Consumption of aviation turbine fuel has also increased by about 40 per cent . Greenhouse gas emissions from aviation have more than trebled since 1994 . The IEA ( 2010 ) estimated an exceptional increase in emissions of 165.7 per cent between 1990 and 2008 , compared to the world average of 76.1 per cent . High passenger occupancy and relatively younger fleets of the Indian private airlines assures more efficient operations . But India needs immediate steps for the Aviation Environmental Unit " Initiative of the Director General of Civil Aviation to come up with integrated approach that includes technology and operational practices ; modification in Climb , cruise and descent cycle ; additional aspects of business strategies and models ; demand management ; air transport management , airport management , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routes with a low load factor among others . <p> * Revive inland waterways for climate and pollution benefits : Inland waterways have significant advantages over all other transportation systems . It ensures more efficient carriage : A barge can carry cargo equivalent of 15 rail wagons or 60 truckloads worth of goods . Its cheaper -- the operating cost per tonne kilometre in waterways is Rs 0.53 as against Rs 1.32 in railways and Rs 2.75 in roadways . It is more -- a litre of diesel would carry 105 tonnes over a kilometre through waterways , 85 tonnes through railways and 24 tonnes through roadways . It emits much less -- An IWT vessel emits less than 50% of carbon a lorry emits , The Indian Network on Climate Change Assessment estimates that inland navigation caused one per cent of total transport GHG emissions in 2007 . <p> But poor navigability of rivers -- fewer days of navigability , limits the transportation potential of the rivers . At Allahabad , navigability of the Ganga restricted to 140 days for large vessels with the least available depth of 1.5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a capacity of 750 tonnes due to less navigable depth . This needs urgent revival plan . The proposed plan includes Inland Vessel Building Subsidy Scheme for augmentation of vessel fleet , budget for technological upgradation . Central government is expected to facilitate inland water transport operators to obtain loans ; river training and conservancy , including dredging ; new **25;927;TOOLONG canals like Yamuna canal and delta canals of Mahanadi , Godavari and Krishna . <p> The way forward <p> India needs multi-pronged strategies to fulfill the vision of reducing oil imports , strengthening energy security and cutting down GHG emissions and protecting public health . Areas of specific focus could be : <p> Create niche for advanced vehicle technologies : Government of India has already come up with a proposal to incentives hybrid and electric vehicles .

And just like how the party is struggling to pitch someone against the Gujarat CM in real life , they 're literally out of options in the social media . <p> Rahul Gandhi , given his wobbly social media and PR back-up , has deliberately stayed away from platforms like Twitter , Facebook or blogging . While reformed Tweeters like Shashi Tharoor bring a semblance of sanity to the virtual space , a Manish Tewari or Digvijaya Singh adds precious little to the party 's virtual image .

You should remain polite but not soft . " <p> We are guessing he flaunted his recent exchange with Sushma Swaraj as an example . While not much is known about Khidkee and how it would help bolster Congress ' online dialogue with its target voters , we decided to walk through the site and figure out how it intends to work . <p> Considering the site was launched just yesterday , it 's not right to jump to conclusions about how effective it is as yet .

Amidst heart-stopping excitement , Australia bowled out England for 120 to win the Old Trafford Test by three runs and secure the Ashes . Arunabha Sengupta looks back at the immortal match which saw Victor Trumper score a century before lunch and Fred Tate become immortal for dropping a sitter . But it was Hugh Trumble 's six-wicket haul in the second innings -- and 10 in the Test -- that swung it in Australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wickets in hand.At the wrong place at the wrong time <p> Perhaps it was fate , perhaps a tactical blunder . Perhaps captain Archie MacLaren was at fault , perhaps he was not . Future Australian captain Warwick Armstrong , who had been waiting pensively for his turn to bat when that infamous lapse took place , did remark three decades later that the fault actually lay with the leg-spinner Len Braund . <p> But whatever be the root cause , the effect ended in a tragedy that sunk English hopes and relegated Fred Tate forever into the realms of embarrassment . The stigma would never be removed from this honest toiler with the ball . <p> Had his selection in the team itself been the fundamental mistake ? The cricketing circles were rife with criticism for his being preferred over such a weighty name as George Hirst . Why go for a 35-year-old off-spinner who had never played for England before by leaving out a champion all-rounder of established credentials ? Especially when down 1-2 in the Ashes ? <p> Even Wisden criticised it as " a blunder " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work ? Or did England selector and Yorkshire supremo Lord Hawke prefer to secure his county 's chances in the domestic championship , and hence kept Hirst , and also fast medium bowler Schofield Haigh , out of the side ? There is also the theory that MacLaren left Hirst out and chose Tate because he wanted to demonstrate to the selectors the folly of their choices . <p> Hirst returned in the next Test match at The Oval and took six Australian wickets before guiding England to a one wicket win in the nail-biting last stages of the game . Another man omitted from the team at Old Trafford , Gilbert Jessop , returned to play one of the most murderous match-winning innings of 104 . All this has gone down as stuff of legends . <p> However , to be fair to the selection , Fred Tate had been phenomenal in the domestic season till then , picking up 128 wickets at 12.63 from the first 14 matches . The soft and slow wicket at Old Trafford suited his style . MacLaren might have been lauded for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the reason and rationale , when Syd Gregory took a single and captain Joe Darling came on strike on the second afternoon , MacLaren made his next crucial decision . The score read a little more than nothing for three . Bill Lockwood looked lethal . He had already dismissed Victor Trumper , Clem Hill and Reggie Duff with a mere seven runs between them . The 37-run first innings deficit was already neutralised by quick blows . <p> At the other end , Len Braund was bowling his leg breaks . And Gregory pushed him for a single . It brought Darling on strike , a southpaw and an excellent striker of the ball . On that slow , damp wicket , the deep square leg was a vital fielder for a leg-spinner bowling to an aggressive left-hander . The specialist in that position was Lionel Palairet , a Somerset teammate of Braund , who patrolled the square boundary at Taunton . And he had been stationed deep on the leg field for Gregory . Now , with the last ball of the over coming up , MacLaren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the ground to the other extreme end , Tate , from the infield on that side , was pushed back to the fence . <p> In 1933 , Armstrong claimed that it was Braund who wanted Tate to be placed there . <p> The off-spinner , a kindly fellow who never hurt a soul , had no throwing arm to speak of . Hence , for Sussex , he generally found himself at slip , or in the covers . Now , he waited for the pivotal delivery , in all probability hoping that it would not come to him . <p> The leg-break spun in to Darling . He was on 17 at that time . The Australian captain got down on his knee and played the slog sweep . It soared up , high and hopeless , straight in the direction of Tate . The crowd waited to erupt in ecstasy . The fielder watched it descend , wavering in the breeze . He positioned his hands , hoping that it would somehow find a way to stick . Perhaps then he could go back to slip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretch eternally across time and space into a huge tale of humiliation . <p> Tate never looked like holding the catch . He found himself out of position , a fatal misjudgement , and made a desperate grab with his left hand . The crowd gasped . The ball went down irretrievably , the red blob bouncing on the green , rolling along before coming to a stop . The Manchester crowd witnessed the most famous fielding error in the history of Ashes until Shane Warne dropped Kevin Pietersen 103 years later to balance the equation for England . <p> Tate wondered if the famous Old Trafford turf would be kind enough to open up and swallow him . The shock soon resorted to questions of the most obvious kind . Did anyone in his right mind think George Hirst could have missed it ? Hell , several members of the crowd claimed that they themselves would not have missed such a gift of a catch . What was the man doing on the field anyway ? <p> Darling and Gregory added 54 . It was Tate himself who broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up another wicket to finish with perfectly decent figures of two for seven off five overs . He even caught Bert Hopkins in the slip off Lockwood . <p> But , Darling top-scored with 37 . Ironically , he was caught in the outfield by Palairet off the slow left-arm bowling of Wilfred Rhodes In the context of the match that was a monumental contribution . Australia ended the day at 85 for eight and , after five hours of continuous rain early next day , finished their second essay at only 86 . Even Wisden wrote , " If the catch had been held it is quite likely , as Lockwood was bowling in such wonderful form , that the Australians would have been out for 50 or 60 . " <p> But now , England required 124 . As Justin Parkinson wrote in Maurice Tate 's biography Then came Massacre , " Tate 's drop had turned winning from a formality to a probability . " <p> Well , Tate must have returned to the dressing room and though that the worst was over . The England batsmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brighton , in the familiar fields of county cricket . The ardent desire to be picked for some tours this late in his career had probably died a cruel death . There would be no financial benefit as a professional at this late stage of the career . He had literally muffed his chance . Old Tate was not a character to survive high tragedy under the limelight in the city . <p> But , he was only halfway through his ordeal.The magic of Trumper <p> If MacLaren 's error proved pivotal , it was Darling 's call on the first day which had set the ball rolling Australia 's way . On a rainy morning , Darling won the spin of the coin and decided to bat . The pitch was wet , but not yet the drying out dampness that is associated with a sticky dog . As it turned out , the balls did not leap and shoot and imperil batsmen from all angles . The pitch was slow , absorbing the pace of the ball , sending them at a comfortable clip to the batsmen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would reduce the wicket to vicious . But for now , it could be batted on . As the Manchester Guardian noted , " The winning of the toss ... meant the winning of the game . " <p> And on that wicket Trumper strode out , dashing , debonair and handsome . MacLaren 's directive was precise as England took field , " Keep Victor quiet . The pitch will be sticky as the day goes on , then we 'll bowl them out as fast as they come in to bat . " <p> But , Trumper 's genius could not be subdued with intent or instruction . The bowling was punished with great freedom of willow and spirit . Two lofted drives went straight over the sightscreen into the practice ground , holding up play as the ball was recovered . According to the rules of the day , only four runs resulted from the strokes . But , Trumper reached his 50 in 52 minutes , added 135 with Duff in just 78 minutes . MacLaren confessed , " Victor had half a dozen strokes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australian 150 came up in an hour and a half , for the loss of only one wicket . Clem Hill had come in for Duff and he too did not slacken pace for stability . Seven minutes before lunch , Lockwood began an over with Trumper on 92 . And the batsman 's blade flashed as he pulled twice to the leg boundary , on both occasions off his stumps . The century had come in 105 minutes , and included 14 fours , three threes , and six twos . Old Trafford had been witness to history , the first century before lunch on the first day of a Test match . And it rose as one to congratulate the young master . <p> The Times observed , " His innings was marked by splendid hitting on the leg side , and his placing on the off side was remarkable . He is certainly the finest cricketer on all wickets we have had from Australia . " The feat of a century before lunch has been repeated only three times , by Charlie Macartney , Don Bradman and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been at the ground as a boy , and one of the strokes of Trumper had struck him as he had sat with his friends on the boundary . It is probably a rehashed figment of his fanciful imagination , but this was an innings which had the license of being embellished with romantic fiction . Cardus wrote of the day : " His cricket burns always in my memory with the glow and fiery hazard of the actual occurrence , the wonderful and consuming ignition . He was the most gallant and handsome batsman of them all ... His swift and apparent daring , the audacity of prancing footwork , were governed by a technique of rare accuracy and range . " Jackson responds <p> Trumper was out soon after lunch , for 104 , getting a thin edge off Rhodes . Hill and Darling got half centuries , but Lockwood and Rhodes soon made short work of the rest . The Australian innings ended at 299 . Tate , having spent a fitful night trying to sleep in a rented Manchester attic , sent down 11 overs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that diabolical off-break bowler Hugh Trumble paired up with the slow left-arm spin of Jack Saunders to cast a spell on the batsmen . Three wickets were lost for just 14 , and then a curiously tentative KS Ranjitsinhji was out leg before for a painstaking two . <p> It was 44 for five when that superb trendsetter of batting 's Golden Age , Stanley Jackson , and the light hearted leg-spinning all-rounder Braund , joined hands and willows . With infinite caution the two stretched the innings into the second day . Slim and classy , Jackson was England 's response to Trumper 's audacity in the match . Braund lent him splendid support . The score had reached 185 when Braund departed after a composed 65 . The Yorkshire amateur , sensing the end of batting resources at the other end , threw his bat at the bowling . Seventy seven runs were added with the last four batsmen , with none of the tail-enders scoring more than seven . Jackson was last out for 128 , having added 27 for the last wicket with a resolute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the match , the stubborn knock of an unbeaten five . <p> And then followed the three Lockwood wickets and the soaring catch to deep square-leg that spilled through the hands of Tate.The battle of the last day <p> Trumble and Saunders started the Australian attack yet again as the England batsmen walked out in pursuit of 124 , MacLaren coming out with Palairet to start the innings . At lunch they were still together , the score on 36 . The series looked all set to be squared . The crowd was in the best of spirits , the match almost in the bag , the dropped catch all but forgotten . A smile perhaps touched the lips of Tate as well . <p> And then the sun peeped through , hesitantly at first and blazing down within a few minutes . By the time the batsmen were back after refreshments , the wicket started demonstrating the unnerving signs of a sticky . <p> Palairet was out at 44 , to a huge break from Trumble . But , the Englishmen were still soaring with optimism . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prime form , things looked bright even as the sun shone . <p> At 68 , Tyldesley edged Saunders and the bucket hands of Armstrong closed around the offering . But now there was the prince walking out who could get the runs with a few magical twirls of his oriental blade . <p> However , Ranjitsinhji , that most fluent of players , scratched around , the noble soul of his art reduced to struggle for survival . And MacLaren was worried . If Ranji struggled , the rest would surely succumb . He tried to hit his way out of trouble and tension , lifting Trumble into the deep . At long on Duff held the catch . The skipper had played a priceless innings of 35 . It was 72 for three . <p> On reaching the dressing room , a furious MacLaren flung his bat away , declaring he had " thrown away the match and the bloody rubber . " Not quite the perfect words for a leader to say in front of his side , more than half of whom were yet to bat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> When Ranji continued to pick at balls , apprehension radiating in currents into the stands , it seemed the spirit of the Indian prince had departed totally , the man who stood in his silk shirt rippling in the wind was a crude doppelganger . <p> Bobby Abel lofted one over the head of Hill for a boundary , and followed it up with some gallant strokes . The crowd buzzed excitedly for a while . And then Trumble ended the torture for Ranji , trapping him leg before wicket for the second time in the match , his four runs an eternity of agony for such a noble conjurer . He never played for England again . The score stood at 92 for four . <p> And soon after Jackson had emerged for his second knock , receiving a hero 's welcome from a crowd full of his Roses rivals , Trumble turned one a long way to hit the stumps of Abel . The win was not so certain any more with the score on a precarious 97 for five . <p> But it brought together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the first innings . Wicketkeeper Dick Lilley , Lockwood and Rhodes were all able men with the bat . And supposedly , and here we have to quote the rather suspect chronicle of Cardus , whispers went around saying that Tate had hit a fifty sometime in his career . He indeed had . Six of them , with a highest of 84 . But , none had come against an attack of this quality on a wicket this atrocious . <p> Runs came in ones and an occasional two . Every ball was accompanied by thousands of cracked knuckles , bitten nails and hopes and trepidations . And then Jackson reached out to drive Saunders and the ball held up . The stroke was made and mistimed . The shot went up . At mid-off Gregory held the catch . The sixth wicket down for 107 . A man in the stands was furiously gnawing the handle of his umbrella as Lilley walked to the middle . <p> Two runs later Braund jumped out to Trumble . He missed and James Kelly had the bails off in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to force the players away . Lockwood joined Lilley , given an ovation because of his bowling feats fresh in memory . At the other end of the city , office goers received the afternoon edition of the papers proclaiming ' England 92 for three ' . ' Not worth making the trip all the way to the Old Trafford ' , they agreed . ' Hope they make the runs before it comes pouring down , ' someone else suggested . Those good old days without the curse of communication . <p> Lockwood looked overcome with tension , emotion , the enormity of the situation . Trumble , the wily veteran , flighted one up and the Nottinghamshire bowler played inside the line . His leg stump was hit . It was 109 for eight . <p> Lillee and Rhodes , capable batsmen both , took the score along to 116 . Eight runs were needed . Lillee was throwing his bat , and Rhodes looked poised and cool , with nerves that almost reflected the glint of steel . And now Lilley struck Trumble , high and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground where no fielder could be sighted . The crowd roared . The required runs were about to be halved . A great hit under pressure . <p> And then from the corner of the eyes following the ball , one made out the frenetic form of Clem Hill , running full tilt from the distant post he had been asked to patrol , covering ground like a greyhound . Was it possible to save the boundary ? <p> Hill saved it in the most emphatic possible way , clutching at the ball before it had bounced , the momentum carrying him across another half length of the ground after he had made the catch . Again we return to Cardus and his storehouse of tales on the borderline of history and mythology , delving into his enormous abundance of apocrypha . There supposedly was a parson in the crowd -- one of the favourite professions that popped up everywhere in his chronicles . And the reaction of this man of cloth was : " A sinful catch . " Tate 's last moments of torture <p> Now Tate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a professional with the ball , set to be remembered in history for whatever he now achieved with the bat . And if he failed , his fielding would tag along as an eternal reminder of his crimes . <p> The batsmen had crossed and Rhodes played out the remainder of Trumble 's over . It is highly debatable whether Hirst or Rhodes had really said , " Let 's get it in singles " during their last wicket partnership in the Oval Test that followed . But , Rhodes could have done with a scampered one now . Because , down came pelting rain and the players had to go off the ground . And along with them followed the uneasy feeling that if the rain stopped it would be Tate to take strike and try to win it for England . <p> For an agonising 40 minutes the players waited . In the sadistic recesses of the mind , one can imagine the thoughts fleeting by in poor Fred Tate 's head . If rain stopped it would all boil down to what he could do , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand . And at six minutes to five , the Australians were back in the field . Tate took guard . Did he remember that he had not yet been dismissed in Test cricket ? One can only wonder . <p> The first ball from Saunders was quicker through the air , and down the leg side . Tate played with a straight bat , a sound was heard and Tate looked frantically around . And then there was applause . It had run away down to finest of fine legs . The tall -- then not-so-bulky -- figure of Armstrong raced towards it on the boundary , but the ball beat the outstretched foot . Four of the runs were already collected . Four more to win . Another snick ? <p> The second ball was played with a dead bat . It rolled out quietly in all this furore . And so did the third . Could he survive another three and give Rhodes the next over ? The Yorkshire left-arm spinner would go on to open the batting for England with Jack Hobbs . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable of those four runs . <p> And then Saunders sent down a quicker ball that swung in . Even the best England bat would have been hard pressed to play it . It beat Tate 's bat and broke his wicket , and along with it his heart , and the hearts of the thousands of Englishmen who sat around the ground . Australia won by three runs . <p> In 1903 , in the Sydney Morning Herald , one Australian cricketer in the touring party wrote , " The Australians ran off the field with delight . We got upstairs to the dressing room , and leaped and yelled to get the surplus froth off our wild joy . It was more than we could contain . " <p> Around Fred Tate it was a complete contrast . Apart from that one catch , he had done little wrong in the match . After all , a No 11 batsman can not be expected to score runs on a wicket that had even a Ranji in dilemma . But , he was booed as he walked out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the professionals he cried . Sitting there , Braund tried to cheer him up , " Go on Fred , get upstairs and get your money -- it 's only a game . " It did not work . Even on the way back , he broke down in the waiting room at Manchester . <p> On their journey back though the Midlands , Braund remarked , " Cheer up , Fred , it 'll be all over in a week or so . " The morose Tate had responded prophetically , " It never will . " <p> He was right . The match has gone down as ' Fred Tate 's Test ' . Not Trumper 's , nor Hill 's for all their magic with bat and on the field . It has been remembered for the batting and fielding bloomers of Tate , who made his living as an off-spinner . <p> Braund claimed that at the end of this conversation Tate looked at him and said , " I 've got a kid at home who 'll make it up for me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really spoken . But , this kid did make amends for his father . <p> As Abhishek Mukherjee writes , " Maurice Tate , only a boy of seven then , kept his father 's words : he went on to play 39 Tests for England , picking up 155 wickets at 26.16 ( in addition to being a fairly competitive batsman who scored 1,198 runs at 25.48 with a hundred ) and picked up 38 wickets from five Tests at 23.18 in his first Ashes series . " <p> In the outcry that arose after the match , one Yorkshire newspaperman could not forgive MacLaren and the selectors for the inexplicable error of leaving out Hirst in favour of Tate . The words that were published in the press had almost Biblical wrath : " Ministers of religion publicly prayed that heaven would open the eyes of these misguided men ...

@@435239 <h> Why neither Telangana nor Andhra Pradesh need Hyderabad as capital <p> Who should get Hyderabad , and how soon , will become a major bone of contention between the to-be-created state of Telangana and the rump state of Seemandhra left behind after the carve-up . <p> By suggesting that Hyderabad should be the joint capital of the two states or that it should be given to Telangana after five or 10 years , the centre will only keep the wound festering . If Hyderabad has to go to Telangana , it might as well be given upfront . Seemandhra can then start the process of building its own capital -- assuming it needs one at all . This writer believes Seemandhra does not need either Hyderabad or its own capital to flourish . <p> Consider the case of Chandigarh : it is the joint capital of Punjab and Haryana , but the issue is still to be sorted out even 45 years after the separation of Haryana from united Punjab . Chandigarh was given to Punjab , but Haryana is due to receive two small bits of Hindi-speaking areas from Punjab in return , and so the stalemate continues . <p> However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Regardless of who owns Chandigarh , both Punjab and Haryana are doing very well economically . Haryana is one of the fastest-growing states in the union , and Punjab is also doing quite well , thank you . <p> Did they need a separate capital city to deliver ? Do states actually need something called a capital city to function effectively ? <p> Let 's start by asking ourselves what function a capital city actually serves . <p> First , they house the government and its ministers . Cabinets tend to meet in capital cities . But they can meet elsewhere too . <p> Second , they house legislatures . Big domed structures give our democracy its decorative talk-shop . But J&amp;K and Maharashtra have legislatures working out of two cities -- Srinagar and Jammu in the former case , and Mumbai and Nagpur in the latter case . <p> Third , capital cities house armies of government officials -- the implementation arm of government . From top policemen to bureaucrats to other administrative employees , capital cities are home to the top of the power structure . But does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Chennai ? <p> Ministers may need houses and office rooms for cabinet meetings . That requires a building or two , not a designated capital city . <p> Legislatures also need a building and a secretariat . That again needs a building . It helps if the legislature is situated next to ministerial offices , since ministers have to be in and out of the place often . But it is not essential . Keeping ministries away from legislatures will ensure that ministers actually take legislative discussions seriously . Now they can disappear and appear as they please . <p> Government officers -- the Director General of Police , the chairpersons of various state corporations , etc , - also need places to work from . But there is no need to think that everybody needs to be in the same place . <p> How would a corporation , which has to choose between buying expensive real estate in one place and dispersing its officials all over make a decision ? <p> Barring a small headquarters office , it would let its senior managers work from where they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would connect all offices with a video conferencing capability . <p> Third , it would ensure that critical staff work where they need to : sales and marketing would work close to customers , manufacturing and supply chain personnel close to suppliers , etc . Putting up everyone in one place has its downside too . Salespeople will be hobnobbing with top management for favours instead of serving customers . <p> Corporate boards that think about shareholders do n't work on the assumption that they need huge buildings and edifices to make a style and status statement . <p> So why should governments think they need a capital -- with all the trappings of power -- to be effective ? Should , for example , an agriculture or rural development minister be sitting in Mantralaya or the capital city to do his work ? Or should he be working out of an agriculture university campus ? Should the industry minister be in Mumbai or where the new industries are coming up ? If a businessman in Mumbai wants to talk to someone in Nagpur , why ca n't he do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to sit in the capital city ? If J&amp;K can have legislative sessions in Srinagar and Jammu , and Maharashtra in Mumbai and Nagpur , surely this only shows that legislatures can theoretically be housed in any city of the state ? <p> States need urban development to hitch their growth plans on to , but they do n't necessarily need capital cities . Creating capital cities retards the growth of both cities and state , since money is invested in showpiece projects and creating the paraphernalia of power rather than building the sinews of growth . Mumbai has benefited less from being the capital city of Maharashtra and more from being the centre of commerce and capital . It would be better off if Mantralaya were moved elsewhere -- and the city handed over to a CEO to run . <p> New states ought to set new norms of behaviour where they try to get closer to their people . Focussing on the capital city is a bad place to start thinking about your citizens . <p> Capital cities militate against the idea of bringing government closer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything called a capital city . We need cities , we need capital , we need effective administration . We do n't need capital cities . <p> Hyderabad needs to go to Telangana primarily because it is in the middle of the new state . The city of Hyderabad is also a useful magnet for industry . But that would be the case regardless of whether Hyderabad is the capital of Telangana or an independent city within that state . My bet is that a Hyderabad administered effectively by a sensible city mayor would be more useful to Telangana than as its putative capital .

I have a problem with misogyny . " <p> Yo Yo Honey Singh . <p> Dadlani deserves kudos for using his considerable influence in the film industry to professionally ostracise Yo Yo Honey Singh . Yo Yo Honey Singh 's lyrics ( especially songs like Balatkari , on which there have been conflicting reports whether they were Honey Singh 's or not ) , are undeniably reprehensible . While such righteousness is somewhat ironic in an industry that profits from female objectification , but Honey Singh 's lyrics go far beyond the sexism of songs like Fevicol , and unashamedly express the desire to rape and abuse women who have the audacity to ' tick-tock ' around in their heels .

His popularity is also undeniable , and uncontainable . No matter how many television panels condemn him , Yo Yo Honey Singh is , till the next big thing rolls around , here to stay . This is why even a Bollywood power player like Dadlani has not been able to keep him out of the biggest Bollywood release of the year . Even if he had succeeded , banning him from Bollywood would not diminish his popularity , or prevent his songs from becoming the rape anthems of young men .

" He added later , addressing Poetry , " and you my love are utterly modern . " The meaning is clear . The poet deplored the fate of poetry " banished into the greyness of the tuneless papers " . For the poet , his poetry had to be recited and sung . When Tagore says in Gitanjali " thou are the Sky and thou are the nest as well " or " in the playhouse of infinite forms I have had my play and here have I caught sight of him that is formless , " the reader has to read the poetry over and over again to try and catch the mysticism of Tagore 's philosophy . <p> If cold print for the poet could not reveal the sublime beauty of his lyrics , what about the printed word trying to catch the spirit of Tagore 's approach to dance ? The evening at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian Women in association with Sarbojan Pooja Committee of Gurgaon , saw the book release of " Rabindra Natyam " by Guru Valmiki Banerjee , followed by a presentation of " Bhanu Singher Padabali " in Maithali , the dance directed by the author and rendered by a group of his disciples . <p> A highly committed dancer/guru , Valmiki Banerjee has been involved with Rabindra Natyam for well over half a century . A great lover of classical dances like Manipuri , Kathakali and Bharatanatyam , and folk dances , Tagore 's dance visualisation with mixing and matching of styles was his own , and while he had had no formal training as a dancer , he had his own perspective on dance , which the Santiniketan productions exemplified . He believed that rhythm was a universal phenomenon of Nature and Man , and that every atom in the Universe vibrates to the rhythmic shadow of dance -- " Visva-tanute anute anute kape nrtyera chaya . " <p> Neatly got up , the English translation of Banerjee 's Bengali original is by Dr. Ratri Ray and Nandini Eswer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dance drama , creative dance drama , modern dance drama , lyrical drama and pastoral " . He theorises on technique of body movement and lists out points in consonance with the Natya Shastra , Tagore 's idea of Nayika Bhed , the various emotions dealt with , the use of feet and hands and his use of tala , laya and chhanda . And even goes into details of costume . Banerjee 's own training under Kalachand Singh ( Manipurii ) , Sohan Lal ( Kathak ) , Guru Gopinath and Tahangamani ( Kathakali ) , Prabhat Misra ( Kathak ) , Mukundadas Bhattacharjee ( folk culture of Bengal ) , and a host of others gave him an eclectic dance background . A list of Rabindra Natyam mnemonics makes interesting reading -- for the sounds used are very onomatopoeic , like " Thara thara bhara bhara " , " Jhini jhini kinkini " , " Jharo-jharo guru guru " , " kalakala chala chala " and so on . <p> With all that is said about the ' shastra ' in Rabindra Nritya , the dance , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weight of classical grammar not visibly felt . <p> " Bhanusingher Padavali " is one of the poet 's earlier works and seems highly influenced by the Vaishnava padavalis . <p> Unlike Tagore 's other dance drama compositions where the hero and heroine are human characters -- common man as in " Chandalika " , and princes as in " Chitrangada " -- " Bhanusingher Padavali " is an exception for it deals with the love of Radha and Krishna . Conceived as separate lyrics not arranged in a dramatic mode , these songs have to be selectively strung together to form a dance narrative . The songs are on love , and the classical heroines like basaka-sajjika , utkanthita , abhisarika , khandita are portrayed showing love in separation and in the joy of union . One lyric even compares Death with Lord Krishna " Maran re , tuhu mama syama saman " ( Death , you are like my beloved Krishna ) . <p> The production had the traditional five fold salutation and homage to the Pancha-Bhutas -- Ksiti ( Earth ) , Ap ( Water ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Vyoma ( Ether ) . Valmiki is a very conservative guru it would seem , and his Rabindra Nritya does not depart from the old style he learnt , even for a moment . So , predictably , there were no surprises in the dance drama treatment . The bunch of enthusiastic disciples gave a very involved presentation , with a most ebullient Krishna ( a little too much expression on face though , bordering on exaggeration ) , particularly in the cheerharan scene and sequences with Radha . Tagore 's love for Nature and its moods being responded to by man was all too evident in songs like " Shamana gagane ghor ghana ghata " . <p> Somehow the passages in Maithili providing the connectivity in the narrative with the original Bengali songs of Tagore following , at times did not blend smoothly . And too many ragas , for this critic , gave a restless feel to the music . And what with the loud sitar tones and other instruments , it was more like the Bharatiya Kala Kendra type of music rather than Rabindra Sangeet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's book provides a welcome introduction .

Sambar may not be the most beautiful of deer species , but it certainly is an important one for the fragile ecosystem of a forest . <p> The eyesight of the sambar is weak . However , to recompense for this , it has exceptional powers of smell and hearing , tipping off the approach of a predator . The internal lining of the nose is covered with specialised skin called epithelium , which is covered by mucus membrane . The larger the deer , the greater the epithelium surface area and the more acute its sense of smell . It is believed , therefore , that a larger and older deer is able to detect odours better than younger ones . The major predators of sambar are tigers and leopards . <p> However , we have seen an interesting incident near a waterhole : a pair of jackals attacked a sambar fawn and killed it . This was perhaps astonishing for the sambar too . The sambar on sighting the pair had not made any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceive the jackals as a threat and the pair took advantage of the situation . It was only when the fawn was caught by the jackals that the sambars realised the danger and made a dash for their lives , emitting that famous alarm call . Usually , when the sambar feels the danger , it stamps its leg and makes a ringing call known as poking or belling . <p> The breeding season ( rut ) of the sambar is mainly between October and December ; however , it has also been reported in other months of the year . A single calf is born after a gestation of eight months . Interestingly , the breeding of Sambar is correlated with its annual antler development cycle . In Ranthambhore , the hard antlers of sambar start shedding in May . Spectacular velvety antlers start to emerge in the monsoon months . The male sambar has the most admirable pair of antlers reaching up to 2.5 feet . The new antlers have a vascular skin that feels like velvet , and supplies oxygen and blood to the growing antlers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hard bony antlers are seen . In winter , their antlers are strong and hard , and the males usually engage in antler wrestling and sparring around this time . The winner would usually put dry grass on the antlers , as a display of the triumph . <p> An interesting attribute in the species is that the sambar has special preorbital glands , placed below the eyes . The glands secrete pheromones and other chemicals . Male sambar rubs pheromones on trees to let the female know about its presence during mating season . The glands swell during the rutting phase . <p> Also , the male sambar demonstrates a distinctive behaviour called wallowing : it would cover itself in wet mud and urinate , and the mud acts like a medium to keep the urine scent for longer , allowing the sambar to send mating signals to the females around . It also uses this to mark territory . These wallowing , sparring , scent communications are rituals and behaviour for attracting females for courtship . <p> After eight months , a single calf is born , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

Excerpts : <p> ET Now : Does it seem like a long way the rupee may have bottomed out ? <p> Deven Choksey : The market is in the grip of operators and the actions from the government and the RBI are little and scattered . On one side , the finance minister has talked about swapping the rupee with the other nations and , in turn , bringing down the current account deficit . It is a good move , but the RBI must take corrective actions as well . Before the Fed start tapering off the QE , the RBI should start slashing the rate of interest . The inflow of money then could happen faster as that would signal the growth in the economy . These are the two measures which are required to be done . It would stabilise the equity market . So these are some of the details which need to be understood . <p> ET Now : Do you think some of the NBFCs like PFC , REC or M&amp;M @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That could be possible because the tight monetary policy adopted by the RBI has impacted . The victims are those people who are buying the bulk deposits and some of the NBFCs are into this bracket as well . The new RBI governor may adopt the growth path and he may probably bring the sharp fall in the rate of interest . The monetary policy would start getting reversed sooner than later . Therefore , the kind of dark cloud which is hanging on the head of most of the NBFCs would disappear . So , the perception impact on NBFCs may become positive and most of the NBFCs would return to a proper valuation . Many of the NBFCs have come down to just one time price to book valuation . That could improve by 15-20 per cent . <p> ET Now : These would be the top news makers probably , FT and MCX . What do you do with these two stocks ? <p> Deven Choksey : MCX is better because of the exchange base model and the franchises created therein . There is a prospect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some entity . If they are serious about the exchange ownership given to the distributed players , the re-rating could take place going forward and the revival of business in the exchange could happen sooner . The choice then would be with MCX to buy , but if one wants to buy in an uncertain environment , one would require to stay on with the investment for a longer period of time . That much I must like to put it across . Any investor taking a call here , they must stay on for the longer period of time because the positive aspects of it would get reflected only after some kind of structural changes on the ownership side from the Government of India. ? <p> ET Now : The EGoM on gas allocation just to remind you has decided to maintain status-quo on priority . Your first reaction on this news ? <p> Deven Choksey : Well , I do not know . We are getting too many policy actions coming in from the government side at least on this space . Every second day , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of policy measures are taken with such a frequent speed , one finds it very difficult as to how do you pick up the investment , how do you stay invested in this space . Honestly , we believe that at this point of time , the gas allocation business is not becoming very smooth for anybody to understand rather than to speculate on any aspect , one would stay safely invested with a company like Reliance which is having a larger part of the gas generated outside India than within India . So I would rather stay with Reliance and be happy instead of getting into this kind policy rigmarole which keeps on happening on a day to day basis . <p> ET Now : A bit of an up tick may continue into expiry week as well , but generally is this a good time to advocate stocks , are you doing something like that with your clients ? <p> Deven Choksey : Well , the investment activity continues in a market like this as well and we certainly look around for opportunities in good quality stocks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be generalized , but at the same time a few stocks where we find ourselves comfortable buying into in the market and corrective market , one would be LIC Housing Finance . The stock is pretty much available at price to book value of one . So downside is limited . The growth rate continues in the vicinity of around 29-30% , so it is giving me a larger amount of comfort . I have kept the buying levels somewhere around 154-156 levels as a downside support for this stock . So in market like this if you get an opportunity like this , one could take a call and buy this stock into the portfolio . So of course I am investing for longer time , I am not trading for short term . <p> ET Now : Just wondering , there was some bit of a fight back by IT , in fact Tech Mahindra or a couple of others did very well . Is that a stock that you like in the tech space ? <p> Deven Choksey : Within midcap we like something which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge potential for upside . It is a company called KPIT Cummins . The company is basically more on the embedded technology side and that too their focus vertical is in the automobile and the automation within the automobile . So from a perspective of buying this company from a longer term point of view where a few more patterns which are likely to get rolled out at some point of time in the form a product which is going to drive this company and we find that having got this company at a valuation which is close to 10 times price earning ratio .

Government data shows crimes by juveniles -- specially rape and abduction of women -- has seen an exponential rise in the past decade .

@@475236 <h> 4 places to buy parts for your PC <p> However , each of the big stores does have its own advantages and disadvantages . <p> Lifehacker Aug 24 , 2013 , 05.11 PM IST <p> I built a new computer recently and it was a nightmare . It took months of going back and forth with Newegg to get parts that worked , and their service was horrible . What other vendors do you recommend ? <p> We here at Lifehacker have been debating this for awhile , and a lot of it comes down to personal preference . However , each of the big stores does have its own advantages and disadvantages , so here are some of our favorite places to buy ( and what they 're good at ) . <p> Newegg has a great database and search engine Newegg is an interesting beast . On the one hand , they have a pretty solid selection and an amazing search engine . If you do n't know what product you want but you know what specs you want , their power search will find anything that matches your specifications . They also have a multitude of reviews from experienced builders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've found no better place online to search for parts . <p> Their return policy and customer service is a little more up in the air . One tour of Yelp or Consumer Affairs would confirm their reputation as a company with horrible customer service and returns , but when we asked you guys on Twitter and Google+ , your experiences were pretty positive across the board . We have heard the occasional stories of people being charged restocking fees for defective products and things like that , but overall we have n't heard enough to not recommend them . <p> That said , their return policy is quite complicated , so you should definitely give it a read . It 's very long and each product has its own rules on when and how you can return it , which can make things like that a bit of a pain . If you do n't like Newegg , Tiger Direct is similar in selection , but without the super powerful search . <p> Amazon has great prices , shipping , and service Lately , I 've been buying almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar or cheaper to other stores , and with Amazon Prime ( which is well worth the price ) , shipping is faster and cheaper too . Their return policy is also great and super easy to navigate . <p> Trying to find parts on Amazon , though , is not so easy . I do n't blame them for this since they are n't a PC parts retailer , but it means that if you do n't know exactly what you want , you 'll need to do your searches elsewhere first . For example , if you 're looking for a monitor that 's 24 " , 120Hz , has DVI and HDMI outputs , and has 1080p resolution or above , Amazon does n't have a powerful search engine to help you . <p> NCIX has price matching and a large selection <p> NCIX is a slightly lesser-known store that 's just come to the US . It is n't usually my first stop for PC parts , but it does have a few advantages : first of all , it has a large selection on stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like water cooling parts . Secondly , it has a price matching feature that is fantastic . You just plug in the URL of any site with a lower price on a certain product , and NCIX will ( usually ) automatically match it for you . You may still have to pay shipping , but for some of those more obscure items , it 's great . <p> Micro Center has serious CPU deals <p> Lastly , it 's worth mentioning some of the real-world stores-you know , the ones you actually walk into and buy at the counter . Micro Center in particular is a great store , since they have insanely cheap CPUs compared to other retailers . You ca n't get these deals on their web site ; their whole idea is that the cheap CPUs get you into the store to buy more stuff . If you have some self-control , though , it 's a great way to save some serious cash ( if you have one near you , that is ) . Some other local stores may have tricks like this ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ) , so check around to see what stores are in your area . <p> Our recommendation : Shop around <p> I 've shopped at all the above stores , and personally I like them all . They are n't the only retailers out there , but they 're some of the biggest . <p> No matter which stores you use , I recommend searching for products on a site like Newegg that 's built for it . It 's just easier to search for stuff on Newegg than it is on any other site . From there , plug the model numbers for your parts into PC Part Picker . It 'll tell you where those parts are cheapest , which is a good place to start . From there you can manually tweak your stores ( if , say , you do n't like Newegg or want to buy your CPU at Micro Center ) and you 'll be on your way . Remember , though : try to buy from as few stores as possible to save on shipping . Just because the price is lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you less if you can get free shipping elsewhere . <p> RELATED <h> From around the web <h> More from The Times of India <p> Recommended By Colombia <h> From Around the Web <h> More From The Times of India <p> Recommended By Colombia <h> Comments <p> Characters Remaining : 3000 <h> OR PROCEED WITHOUT REGISTRATION <p> Share on Twitter <h> SIGN IN WITH <p> FacebookGoogleEmail <p> Refrain from posting comments that are obscene , defamatory or inflammatory , and do not indulge in personal attacks , name calling or inciting hatred against any community .

How he must wish that he was fighting the ISI 's evil designs not in Gujarat but in Jammu and Kashmir or Manipur , protected by the blanket cover of the Armed Forces Special Powers Act ( AFSPA ) . In another reality , the trigger happy Vanzara would have had a chest overflowing with medals , sitting in a plush assignment ; certainly not languishing in prison without even the prospect of bail . <p> But Vanzara chose the life of an ' encounter specialist ' . Much like spies , encounter cops operate in the twilight zone between what is legal and what is illegal . Vanzara is probably right when he says that he ( and his men ) was only carrying out the conscious policy of the state . <p> AFP <p> Unfortunately for him , what is conscious policy is not made explicit through written orders . The suspended cop can point a finger at Amit Shah and Narendra Modi , but there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trail leading up to them for the acts that Vanzara finds himself behind bars .

The men and women he is accused of ' murdering ' extra-judicially were hardly innocent citizens . By the account of the Intelligence Bureau ( under the Union Government ) and David Coleman Headley , Ishrat Jahan and her accomplices ( killed by Vanzara and his team ) were linked with the Lashkar-e-Taiba . <p> Sohrabuddin Sheikh ( for whose murder Vanzara was arrested ) was a notorious criminal , a gangster and extortionist who operated with impunity in Gujarat and Rajasthan .

Even Amit Shah , the then Home Minister of the state was n't spared a chargesheet . It may have been easier for Shah to get bail , not simply because he had a top lawyer like Ram Jethmalani ( as Vanzara insinuates in his letter ) , but because he , unlike Vanzara , did n't actually pull the trigger . It 's tough to find a paper trail that leads to Shah . <p> Once upon a time , in the early 2000s , DG Vanzara was a high flyer .

The 1973 outfit featured several batting greats : Garry Sobers , Rohan Kanhai , Clive Lloyd , Roy Fredericks and Alvin Kallicharran ; amazingly Sobers batted at seven . They scored heavily throughout - 652 in the third Test , at Lord 's - and won comfortably despite a bowling attack that , to eyes accustomed to seeing four genuine quicks in a West Indian line-up , might seem a little underpowered - Keith Boyce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sobers - but which boasted plenty of variety and not a little pace . To round things off nicely , Boyce and Julien were sparkling all-round talents capable of lighting up a ground with their displays of hitting .

@@517238 <h> A project that questions concepts of masculinity is more than welcome . <p> We write and talk about women 's rights , about violence against women , about stronger laws to " protect " women and about punishing the men violating these laws . But there is little discussion on what it means to be a man in today 's India . An on-going project titled " Let 's Talk Men " ( www.letstalkmen.org ) has come up with some interesting perspectives on this subject . <p> Has the understanding of being " masculine " changed even as women have begun to think of themselves differently from their mothers ? Or are boys and men , barring a handful of exceptions , no different from their fathers and grandfathers ? Has their view of women changed ? Or do they continue to believe that women , whether they are mothers and sisters , or wives , are basically there to serve them ? <p> Under the Let 's Talk Men project , launched in 1998 , five filmmakers from South Asia -- India , Nepal , Sri Lanka and Pakistan -- were encouraged to explore concepts of masculinity in their own countries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with another set of films . <p> I have seen Delhi-based filmmaker Rahul Roy 's film , Till We Meet Again . It returns to the four young men -- Bunty , Sanjay , Sanju and Kamal from Jehangirpuri on the outskirts of Delhi -- who featured in his first film . In 1999 , when Roy made When Four Friends Meet , these four men were single . In the new film , all of them are married . The film explores how these men see their own lives , what they think of their wives , why they justify hitting their wives ( something they did not support when they were single ) , and what they feel about the expectations of their families and society from them . <p> Such an exploration is particularly relevant at the present moment when there are so many questions being asked about the growing violence against women in the public space -- although the greater violence women continue to experience in their homes has never resulted in such great outrage . What is it that makes men , who seem perfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it is acceptable that they should hit their wives because , as one of them says , that is the only way to make them understand ? <p> Roy 's film raises questions around masculinity through the lives of these four men , all from the same class , living in a lower middle-class neighbourhood . Two of them have work and bring home an income while the other two are unemployed . Yet , the latter would never consider helping their wives with housework . <p> These men 's lives reflect the reality in many of our cities . In a milieu where the value of a man is measured by his ability to take care of his family , men who fail must fear that their " maleness " will be questioned . Yet , there is little in our educational system , or in the media , that seriously addresses these concepts . On the contrary , entrenched views of masculinity are being reinforced every day . <p> Discussions on " gender " tend to leave out men . We do not , for instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family on the roles men are pushed to play . We do not know what is going on in the minds of men as more women get educated . Or why , despite education , the sexual division of labour persists within homes . <p> There is also a serious gap between what women want , and what men expect from them . In response to my last column , a young woman articulated this well : " What I experience as a college student is that there is a growing sense of unease among those who are comforted by the blanket of patriarchy , by the liberation of women . They feel that their space is being invaded and they feel threatened . What they do n't seem to realise is we are only taking back what was ours in the first place -- the freedom to be oneself and chase one 's dreams .

@@555238 <h> RBI begins move to core CPI <p> RBI has done well in recent years to steer clear of the discredited global consensus that central banks should focus on just inflation control through the manipulation of short-term interest rates . Photo : Pradeep Gaur/Mint <p> Updated : Tue , Oct 01 2013. 07 01 PM IST <p> The latest volume of the official history of the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) was released by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on 17 August . He said in his speech that Raghuram Rajan should take a fresh look at how monetary policy in India operates . One of the issues that the prime minister said was worth revisiting was the problem of what variables the Indian central bank should target . <p> Rajan has since then appointed a committee of experts to think about a new operating framework for monetary policy in India . The committee headed by deputy governor Urjit Patel has already begun work . It is expected to submit its report within three months . <p> RBI has done well in recent years to steer clear of the discredited global consensus that central banks should focus on just inflation control through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been more eclectic for good reason , focusing on other issues such as growth , financial stability and the exchange rate as well . But there have been times when this eclecticism has been overdone . Some of the more bitter critics of the Indian central bank also claim that it has essentially kept shifting the goal posts so as to evade responsibility for the failure to control inflation . <p> There is ample reason to argue that both extremes are unwarranted , so RBI may have to identify an optimal mix of instruments and targets . The key question right now is to see how important a role inflation control should play within a diverse set of monetary policy targets . There are already signs that RBI under Rajan will shift to a flexible inflation targeting approach , with price stability becoming the most important of a small set of monetary policy targets . <p> It also appears that consumer price inflation could replace wholesale price inflation as the key operating variable . Here are three advance indications . <p> 1 . In his very first public statement after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Indian households want to be protected against high consumer price inflation . He then said that the central bank would introduce new inflation-indexed savings certificates whose returns would be pegged to the new consumer price index ( CPI ) . <p> The earlier variants of this financial product had been linked to movements in wholesale prices . Rajan was perhaps indicating that he would be looking more closely at consumer prices . <p> 2 . Two weeks later , Rajan made his first monetary policy statement . He took markets by surprise by increasing the repo rate by 25 basis points . He offered two explanations : " ... inflation is high and household financial saving is lower than desirable . " Much public attention was focused on the first reason . The second one also deserves a closer look . Households base their savings decisions on consumer price inflation , and the negative returns they have been getting on financial assets in recent years could be one reason why they have shifted money into physical assets such as gold . <p> 3 . Rajan was in Germany at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told reporters , according to a Reuters report : " CPI core ( inflation ) is about 8.2% , that is certainly high , but I think we are looking at all aspects of inflation at this point . " Once again , he chose to speak on consumer price trends . In fact , I have been unable to find a single reference by him on wholesale prices since he became RBI governor . <p> The tea leaves suggest that the Indian central bank will be shifting to a regime of flexible inflation targeting -- with core consumer inflation ( which excludes volatile food and fuel prices ) as the most important number to watch . <p> In an online column for Mint in August , economist Renu Kohli had pointed out that the RBI policy rate -- the repo -- has been tracking core CPI for over a year now . The Rajan years may see this getting a formal stamp of approval . <p> The Bank of Thailand moved to a core consumer price target in the year 2000 . The Thai central bank has explained the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of year-on-year percentage change of the consumer price index ( CPI ) that excludes fresh food and energy prices . The rationale for the exclusion of these prices -- i.e. , rice , flour , cereal products , vegetables , fruits , electricity charges , cooking gas , and gasoline -- is that they are highly volatile in the short run as a result of factors beyond the control of monetary policy . The exclusion of fresh food and energy prices thus not only helps decrease the volatility of core inflation but also makes it a better measure of the underlying trend of inflation that stems from demand pressures " . <p> Indian monetary policy has seen two important shifts in recent decades . C. Rangarajan was an inflation hawk who used money supply targets to control price pressures . Bimal Jalan and his successor opted for multiple targets . Is a third momentous change around the corner , with greater focus on core CPI ? <p> Niranjan Rajadhyaksha is executive editor of Mint .

@@572232 <h> Since most molecules are too large to directly pass through membranes , a mechanism is required to deliver the cargo <p> The 2013 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine is awarded to Dr. James E. Rothman , Dr. Randy W. Schekman and Dr. Thomas C. S ? dhof for their discoveries of machinery regulating vesicle traffic , a major transport system in our cells . This represents a paradigm shift in our understanding of how the eukaryotic cell , with its complex internal compartmentalisation , organises the routing of molecules packaged in vesicles to various intracellular destinations , as well as to the outside of the cell . <p> Specificity in the delivery of molecular cargo is essential for cell function and survival . This specificity is required for the release of neurotransmitters into the presynaptic region of a nerve cell to transmit a signal to a neighbouring nerve cell . Likewise , specificity is required for the export of hormones such as insulin to the cell surface . <p> While vesicles within the cell were long known to be critical components of this transportation scheme , the precise mechanism by which these vesicles found their correct destination and how they fused with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mysterious . The work of the three 2013 Laureates radically altered our understanding of this aspect of cell physiology . <p> Eukaryotic cells differ from prokaryotic cells by their more complex intracellular organisation . Distinct cellular processes are compartmentalised . This improves efficiency but a problem emerges . Different compartments need to exchange specific molecules and certain molecules need to be exported to the cell exterior . Since most molecules are too large to directly pass through membranes , a mechanism is required to deliver the cargo . <p> Randy W. Schekman used yeast genetics to dissect the mechanism involved in membrane and vesicle trafficking . He used baker 's yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) as it secretes glycoproteins . Also , the genetically amenable organism was ideal to study vesicle transport and fusion . Schekman devised a genetic screen to identify genes regulating intracellular transport . <p> Initially , he identified two genes -- sec1 and sec2 -- and then went to further identify 23 genes that belonged to three different classes . The sequence of posttranslational events in the export of yeast glycoproteins was then determined with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study of these mutants , Schekman discovered vesicle intermediates in the traffic between the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) and Golgi apparatus . Importantly , the sec17 and sec18 mutants accumulated small vesicles implicating a role in vesicle fusion . <p> James E. Rothman embarked upon a novel approach to dissect events involved in intracellular vesicle transport using an in vitro reconstitution assay . By using this approach , he purified essential components of the vesicle fusion process . Since it was difficult to express genes in animal cells in the 1970s , Rothman took advantage of a system based on vesicular stomatitis virus ( VSV ) . <p> In this system , large amounts of a particular viral protein , the VSV-G protein , are produced in infected cells . A unique feature of this system is that the VSV-G protein is marked by a particular sugar modification when it reaches the Golgi compartment , which makes it possible to identify when it reaches its destination . <p> He then studied both vesicle budding and fusion , and purified proteins from the cytoplasm that were required for transport . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( NSF ) . The next important protein was SNAP ( soluble NSF-attachment protein ) . SNAPs bind to membranes and assist in the recruitment of NSF . An important point of convergence between Schekman 's and Rothman 's work was the discovery that one of the yeast mutants , sec18 , corresponded to NSF , thus revealing that the vesicle fusion machinery was evolutionarily ancient . <p> Using the NSF and SNAP proteins as bait , Rothman next turned to brain tissue , from which he purified proteins that he later named SNAREs ( soluble NSF-attachment protein receptors ) . The three SNARE proteins -- VAMP/Synaptobrevin , SNAP-25 and syntaxin -- functioned together in the vesicle and target membranes . These SNARE proteins were discovered earlier but their functions were unknown . <p> VAMP/Synaptobrevin was found on the vesicle , and SNAP-25 and syntaxin were found at the plasma membrane . This prompted Rothman to propose the SNARE hypothesis . According to the hypothesis , the different SNAREs found on the vesicles ( v-SNARE ) and the targets ( t-SHARE ) played a critical role in vesicle fusion -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activation and fusion . <p> Aside from testing his hypothesis in vitro , he provided evidence that the system has a high degree of specificity , such that a particular target SNARE only interacted with one or a few of the large number of potential vesicle -- SNAREs . <p> In essence , Rothman dissected the mechanism for vesicle transport and membrane fusion , and through biochemical studies proposed a model to explain how vesicle fusion occurs with the required specificity . <p> Thomas C. S ? dhof who was a junior group leader at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School in Dallas set out to study how synaptic vesicle fusion was controlled . While Rothman and Schekman provided the fundamental machinery for vesicle fusion , how the vesicle fusion was temporally controlled still remained enigmatic . This is important as vesicular fusions in the body need to be kept carefully in check , and in some cases vesicle fusion has to be executed with high precision in response to specific stimuli . This is the case for example for neurotransmitter release in the brain and for insulin secretion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how calcium regulates neurotransmitter release in neurons and discovered that complexin and synaptotagmin are two critical proteins in calcium-mediated vesicle fusion . <p> Complexin competes with alpha-SNAP , but not synaptotagmin , for SNAP receptor binding . Neurons from complexin knock-out mice showed dramatically reduced transmitter release efficiency due to decreased calcium sensitivity of the synaptic secretion process . This revealed that complexin acts at a late step in synaptic fusion as a clamping mechanism that prevents constitutive fusion and allows regulated exocytosis to occur . <p> S ? dhof also discovered synaptotagmin-1 ( 21 ) , which coupled calcium to neurotransmitter release . The role for synaptotagmin-1 as a calcium sensor for rapid synaptic fusion was established by elegantly demonstrating that calcium binding to synaptotagmin-1 participates in triggering neurotransmitter release at the synapse . He also characterized Munc18-1 , which corresponds to Schekman 's sec-1 and is therefore also called an SM protein . <p> SM proteins are now known to be an integral part of the vesicle fusion protein complex , along with the SNARE proteins . S ? dhof showed that deletion of Munc18-1 in mice leads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In effect , S ? dhof made critical discoveries that advanced the understanding of how vesicle fusion is temporally controlled and he elucidated the ways that calcium levels regulate neurotransmitter release at the synapse . <h> Importance for medicine <p> The work of Rothman , Schekman and S ? dhof has unravelled machinery that is essential for routing of cargo in cells in organisms as distantly related as yeast and man . These discoveries have had a major impact on our understanding of how molecules are correctly sorted to precise locations in cell . In the light of this , it comes as no surprise that defects at any number of steps in the machinery controlling vesicle transport and fusion are associated with disease . <p> Vesicle transport and fusion are essential for physiological processes ranging from control of nerve cell communication in the brain to immunological responses and hormone section . <p> Deregulation of the transport system is associated with disease in these areas .

A lot of the most painful things I 've ever been through have led to some of the most beautiful things that have ever happened .

Modi who happens to be a compulsive tweeter often takes to Twitter to vent his grievances against the world ( read BCCI ) , which he believes is full of people who 've wronged him . It was on Twitter that he revealed that Boria has been a regular and often unreasonable beneficiary of the BCCI 's largesse . He claimed , with documentaryevidence , that Boria was commissioned by the BCCI for a whopping Rs. 52 lakhs to write a book -- a charge the BCCI calmly refuted by claiming that it was only 33 lakhs .

We tried contacting him through all possible modes , but he chose to not respond . Meanwhile , Sachin Tendulkar announced his retirement and no channel had Boria commenting on it .

@@584233 <h> The theory that caused the financial crisis , gets a Nobel prize <p> Do financial markets have bubbles ? Like most things in economics , the answer to what seems like a rather straightforward question , is yes and no . It depends on which economist you are talking to . <p> Eugene Fama and Robert Shiller are two of the three economists ( the third being Peter Hansen ) who have won the Nobel Prize in Economics this year . <p> When it comes to the bubble question Fama feels there are no bubbles . Shiller , on the other hand , has done some of his best work in economics around financial market bubbles . In fact , he was one of the few economists , who predicted both the dotcom bubble as well as the real estate bubble . Ironically enough , both of them have won the Nobel Prize in the same year . <p> Eugene Fama , who teaches at the University of Chicago , came up with the efficient market hypothesis(EMH) , sometime in the 1960s . A lot of financial theory that followed was built around EMH . Benoit Mandelbrot , a mathematician who did some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As Mandelbrot ( along with Richard Hudson ) writes in The ( Mis ) Behavior of Markets - A Fractal View of Risk , Ruin and Reward " It ( i.e. EMH ) became the intellectual bedrock on which orthodox financial theory sits . " <p> Eugene Fama ( L ) , who teaches at the University of Chicago , came up with the efficient market hypothesis(EMH) , sometime in the 1960s . Reuters <p> So what is the EMH ? As Mandelbrot and Hudson write " At its heart : In an ideal market , security prices fully reflect all relevant information ... Given that , the price at any particular moment must be the " right " one . " <p> And how is that possible ? How can the price of a financial security ( lets say a stock or a bond ) at any point of time incorporate all the information ? <p> Mark Buchanan explains this through a small thought experiment in his book Forecast - What Physics , Meteorology and Natural Sciences Can Teach Us About Economics " Let 's do a thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Suppose that on Tuesday morning everyone knew for sure that the markets would recover , stocks gaining 5 percent ( on average ) in a big rally in the final half hour at the end of the day . Everyone in the market would expect this rise , and lots of people on that morning would be eager to pay up to 5 percent more than current values to buy stock , as they would profit by selling at the day 's very end . Knowledge of the coming afternoon rise would make the market rise immediately in the morning , violating the assumption we made to start this thought experiment ; the prediction of a late rally would be totally wrong . " Hence , information about the market rising by 5% towards its close , would be incorporated into the price of the stocks immediately . <p> Mandelbrot and Hudson give another similar example to explain EMH . " Suppose a clever chart-reader thinks he has spotted a pattern in old price records - say , every January , stocks prices tend to rise . Can he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling in January ? Answer : No . If the market is big and efficient then others will spot the trend , too , or at least spot his trading on it . Soon , as more traders anticipate the January rally , more people are buying in December - and then , to beat the trend for a December rally , in November . Eventually , the whole phenomenon is spread out over so many months that it ceases to be noticeable . The trend has vanished , killed by its very discovery , " write Mandelbrot and Hudson . <p> And this happens primarily because the market is made up of many investors , who are all working towards spotting a trend and trading on it . As Buchanan explains in Forecast " In this view , a market is a vast crowd of investors with diverse interests and skills all working hard to gather information on every kind of manufacturing company , bank , nation , technology , raw material , and so on . They use that information to make best investments they can , jumping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes along , and using that information to profit . They sell currently valued stocks , bonds , or other instruments , and buy undervalued ones . These very actions act to drive the prices back toward their proper , realistic , or " intrinsic " values . " <p> Given this financial markets are correctly priced all the time . Robert Shiller summarizes this argument best in Irrational Exuberance . As he writes " The efficient markets theory asserts that all financial prices accurately reflect all public information at all times . In other words , financial assets are always priced correctly , given what is publicly known , at all times . " <p> And if financial assets are correctly priced , there is no question of any speculative bubbles occurring . As John Cassidy writes in How Markets Fail - The Logic of Economic Calamities " During the 1960s and ' 70s , a group of economists , many of them associated with the University of Chicago , promoted the counter-intuitive idea ... that speculative bubbles do n't exist . The efficient market hypothesis ... states that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account all of the available information ... In short financial prices are tied to economic fundamentals : they do n't reflect any undue pessimism .. If markets rise above the levels justified by fundamentals , well informed speculators step in and sell until prices return to their correct levels . If prices fall below their true values , speculators step in buy . " <p> This ensures that all the available information is priced in . Hence , at any point of time , the market price is the correct price . And given that where is the question of any bubbles popping up ? As Fama put it in a 2010 interview , " I do n't even know what a bubble means . These words have become popular . I do n't think they have any meaning . " <p> Robert Lucas , another University of Chicago economist who won the Nobel prize in 1995 , reflected Fama 's sentiment when he said " The main lesson we should take away from the EMH for policy-making purposes is the futility of trying to deal with crises and recessions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puncture bubbles . If these people exist , we will not be able to afford them . " <p> And this is the view that came to dominate much of the prevailing economic establishment since the 1960s . It is surprising that economists have had so much confidence in a theory for which the evidence is at best sketchy . Raj Patel makes this point in The Value of Nothing " The problem with efficient market hypothesis is that it does n't work . If it were true , there 'd be no incentive to invest in research because the market would , by magic , have beaten you to it . <p> Economists Sanford Grossman and Joseph Stiglitz demonstrated this in 1980 , and hundreds of subsequent studies have pointed out quite how unrealistic the hypothesis is , some of the most influential were written by Eugene Fama himself . " <p> Also , if EMH were true , prices of financial assets would be right all the time , which is clearly not the case . <p> As Buchanan writes " In November 2010 , the New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which individual stocks plunged in value over a few seconds recovering shortly thereafter . In one episode , for example , stock of Progress Energy - a company with eleven thousand employees - dropped 90 percent in few seconds . There was no news released about the business prospects of Progress Energy either before or after the event ... On May 13(2011) , Enstar , an insurer , fell from roughly $100 a share to $0 a share , then zoomed back to $100 in just a few seconds . " <p> Shiller gives the example of eToys and Toys " R " Us , two companies which were into selling toys . As he writes " Consider , for example , eToys a firm established in 1997 to sell toys over the Internet . Shortly after its initial public offering in 1999 , eToys ' stock value was $8 billion , exceeding the $6 billion value of the long established " brick and mortar " retailer Toys " R " Us . And yet in fiscal 1999 eToys ' sales were $30 million , while the sales of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 400 times larger . And eToys ' profits were a negative $28.6 billion , while the profits of Toys " R " Us were a positive $376 billion . " <p> So a company with no profits had a greater market capitalization in comparison to a company making substantial profits . Now as per the EMH this should have never happened . Investors would have sold the eToys ' stock and driven down its price . But that did not happen , at least for a few years . And the stock price of eToys went from strength to strength . But despite the weak evidence in support of EMH , the prevailing economic thinking since the 1960s has been that market prices of financial assets reflect the fundamentals , and hence , there was no chance of bubbles popping up . And even if bubbles did pop up , now and then , there was no chance of identifying them in advance . Alan Greenspan , the Chairman of the Federal Reserve of United States between 1987 and 2006 , believed that a central bank could not spot a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once it burst . <p> This led to him letting the dotcom bubble run . A few years later he let the real estate bubble run as well . He was just following the economic theory that has dominated over the last few decades . As Patel writes " Despite ample economic evidence to suggest it was false , the idea of efficient markets ran riot through governments . Alan Greenspan was not the only person to find the hypothesis a convenient untruth . By pushing regulators to behave as if the hypothesis were true , traders could make their titanic bets ... Governments enabled the finance sector 's binge by promising to be there to pick up the pieces , and they were as good as their word . " <p> In the end , Greenspan did find out that the model did not work and that bubbles did occur , now and then . As he admitted to before a committee of the House of Representatives in October 2008 , " I found a flaw in the model that I perceived is the critical functioning structure that defines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been going for 40 years or more with very considerable evidence that it was working exceptionally well . " <p> So Eugene Fama 's EMH does n't really work and has caused the world a lot of harm . <p> Now compare this to Robert Shiller who in the first edition of Irrational Exuberance , which released some time before the dotcom bubble burst , compared the stock market to a Ponzi scheme . As he wrote " Ponzi schemes do arise from time to time without the contrivance of a fraudulent manager . Even if there is no manipulator fabricating false stories and deliberately deceiving investors in the aggregate stock market , tales about the market are everywhere . When prices go up a number of times , investors are rewarded sequentially by price movements in these markets just as they are in Ponzi schemes . There are still many people ( indeed , the stock brokerage and mutual fund industries as a whole ) who benefit from telling stories that suggest that the markets will go up further . There is no reason for these stories to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news and give less emphasis to the negative .

@@589238 <p> The NRIs are poised to take advantage of the swap window which will fetch them handsome returns on deposits <p> Even before the commencement of festival season , the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) has showered a bonanza on non-resident Indians ( NRIs ) and it appears to be a " festival sale offer " , in the form of abnormally high interest rates on foreign currency non-resident deposits ( FCNR ) , offered by commercial banks that will last till 30 November 2013 . <p> The RBI has been trying to attract foreign exchange into the country with a view of bringing down the current account deficit ( CAD ) , one of the main reasons for the recent depreciation of the rupee which had fallen by almost 20% against US dollar during the year . <p> When India attained independence , the value of the rupee was on par with the US dollar . However , due to a variety of reasons , the Indian rupee depreciated year after year , touching a record low of Rs68.85 to a US dollar . In other words , it has depreciated at an average of one rupee every year since Independence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on 28 August 2013 on rising concerns of flight of capital invested in India by foreign institutional investors ( FIIs ) due to the imminent tapering of quantitative easing ( QE ) by the Federal Reserve Bank of US ( US Fed ) . Though this fall has stopped temporarily and rupee has stabilised around Rs62 per dollar , the government has been frantically trying to boost inward remittances from NRIs with a view to shore up the forex reserves . <p> Inward remittances from NRIs <p> The inward remittances from NRIs form a good part of the forex reserves and these remittances have been growing at a good pace as show in the following graph . <p> Attracting NRI deposits through FCNR deposits <p> Though the foreign exchange position of our country is not that precarious even as remittances from NRIs are growing year after year , RBI appears to be keen to ensure that the forex reserves are not depleted further even when the anticipated outflow of foreign exchange from the country takes place when the US Fed tapers down the pumping of money into the market under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the RBI has provided additional incentives to NRIs to invest in India under the FCNR deposit scheme by raising interest rates . However , to protect the banks in India from possible exchange rate loss , the RBI offered banks the facility of swapping the US dollar funds received from NRIs at a fixed swap rate of 3.50 % , permitting the banks at the same time to accept these deposits up to a tenure of five years at a rate linked to LIBOR ( London Inter-Bank Offered Rate ) as under : <p> Maturity Period <p> Interest rate <p> &gt;1 and &lt;3 years <p> LIBOR*/Swap plus 200 basis points <p> &gt;3 and &lt;5 years <p> LIBOR*/Swap plus 400 basis points <p> FCNR deposit rates currently offered by commercial banks in India <p> Based on the ceiling imposed by RBI , banks are offering higher interest rates to the NRIs on FCNR deposits and are fixed on the first working day of every month valid till the end of the month . The current rates of interest offered on FCNR deposits in India in six foreign currencies with effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Note : These are the rates of deposits offered at present by most of the commercial banks in India , though there are minor variation in these rates from bank to bank which can be ascertained by visiting their websites and they are subject to change from time to time without notice . <p> If you compare these rates with what is offered on US dollar deposits by banks in the US , it is certainly a bonanza for NRIs , as currently U.S banks offer very low interest rates ranging from 0.25% to 0.50 % per annum on Certificate of Deposits of one to five years ( one year Libor is around 0.62 % per annum during last week ) . <p> Obviously , these high rates of interest offered to NRIs can not last long and the RBI has already indicated that the swap facility offered to banks will be available only till 30 November 2013 , and could be closed earlier with prior notice . Also , Dr SS Tarapore , former deputy governor of the RBI , has written in a local media that the swap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposes RBI to losses of an estimated Rs60,000 crore which would be self-immolation " . If this estimate is right , RBI may not continue with this facility for long and may even reduce the interest rates permitted on FCNR deposits if and when the intended purpose of attracting forex inflows into the country is achieved . <p> What are the pros and cons of investing in FCNR deposits with banks in India ? <p> Apart from the higher interest rates offered on these deposits , the NRIs enjoy the following benefits from investing in FCNR deposits with authorized banks in India . <p> 1 . The interest earned on these deposits in India is totally exempt from Indian Income-tax . The tax free status of these deposits is the most important reason for NRIs to invest here . <p> 2 . The deposit amount and the interest earned on these deposits are freely repatriable to the country of residence of the depositor without any restrictions . <p> 3 . There is no exchange risk to the depositor in these FCNR deposits . The principal and the interest are transferred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without any exchange loss . <p> 4 . These deposits can be held in joint names with the close relation of the depositor living abroad . With a view to facilitate smooth banking operations for NRIs in India , RBI has since allowed the NRIs to open FCNR accounts jointly with their resident close relative ( close relative as defined in Companies Act ) on former or survivor basis . The resident close relative shall be eligible to operate the account as a Power of Attorney holder in accordance with the extant instructions during the life time of the NRI/PIO account holder <p> But following precautions must be taken by NRIs while investing in FCNR deposits in India : <p> 1 . Though the interest earned on FCNR deposits at present is tax-free in India , it may be taxable in the country where the NRIs live and they should , therefore , consult their tax advisor in the country of their residence to be clear about the tax implications of investing in India . There are certain double taxation avoidance treaties between India and many countries of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but this can best be ascertained from the tax advisor before investing in India <p> 2 . NRIs/Persons of Indian Origin ( PIOs ) residing in the US should be aware of the implications of the new law recently enacted called the Foreign Accounts Tax Compliance Act ( FATCA ) . From 1 July 2014 , this law will require all financial institutions around the world to report directly to the US Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) all the assets and incomes of any US citizen with $50,000 on their books . The law applies to banks and financial institutions , even if their home countries have secrecy laws . Those that do not comply could face significant fines or be locked out of doing business with American clients . Unlike many other countries , Americans are taxed not only as residents of the US but also as citizens , wherever they live . It appears to be an attempt by US government to recover an estimated $100 billion a year in unpaid taxes on US citizens ' assets invested overseas . <p> 3 . These FCNR deposits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years and any withdrawal before their maturity date will result in penalties for early withdrawal which may vary from bank to bank . It is , therefore , advisable to ascertain from the bank concerned the full details of such penalties before making the deposit . <p> 4 . The rules of investment in India by NRIs are framed by the RBI under the Foreign Exchange Management Act and with regard to tax by Government of India under Indian Income Tax Act and they are , therefore , subject to change from time to time . NRIs are advised to consult their financial advisor for clarity in these matters . <p> 5 . The chances of commercial banks in India going bust are remote , if past experience is any indication . However , there is no guarantee that banks will not fail . Whenever any commercial bank is teetering on the brink , the RBI normally arranges to merge such a weak bank with a strong one , so that the depositors generally do not lose money . However , shareholders may not get back their full investment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 6 . Besides , in India each depositor in a bank , which is authorised and approved by RBI , is insured up to a maximum of one lakh rupees , for both principal and interest amount . This amount at the present exchange rate is equivalent of approximately $1,600 , which is so low it is best to consider deposit insurance as non-existent while investing in banks in India . <p> ( The author is a banking analyst and is a regular contributor on banking and finance .

VOLVO buses are beasts and need to be handled only after receiving proper training . It is a frightening fact these buses are mostly driven at breakneck speed by the drivers on the highways .

In order to get the batsmen to commit an error , Wellington 's captain had asked Vance to hurl no-balls on purpose , and the bowler obliged with a plethora of them .

Songs of Blood and Sword : A Daughter 's Memoir ( 2010 ) was a straightforward account of the brutal killing of her father , Mir Murtaza , allegedly by a conspiracy hatched by her aunt , Benazir . Narrated in a style charged with the dramatic energy of the title , the book was set mostly in Karachi 's Old Clifton area , the seat of Pakistan 's most prominent as well as most blighted political family . <p> In spite of the mixed responses it received , Songs of Blood and Sword ushered in a distinctive voice , one that could be crisp , like a seasoned investigative journalist 's , but also break out into purple prose .

Although it may have been a blessing for Bhutto to get the personal stuff out of the way , it did not necessarily make the task of writing of the novel any easier . <p> The Shadow of the Crescent Moon : Penguin , Viking , 232 pages , Rs 499 " All my codes had to be reset , " she tells me when we meet at her publisher 's office in New Delhi , " because I had written non-fiction for a long time .

The diurnal cycle follows its own chaotic logic here , dictated by exigencies that people in the West , used to a more well-oiled routine , would never be able to anticipate . For instance , in Mir Ali , a perfectly amicable family breakfast may be followed by death in an explosion at the neighbourhood mosque . <p> But thankfully , Bhutto does n't try to be James Joyce . <p> " I 've always had an eye on this region , " she says . " As a child , I had frequent opportunities to travel outside urban Pakistan , and I continue to do so as a journalist .

The middle one , Sikandar , is a mild-mannered doctor , trying to get through each day without courting trouble . And Hayat , the youngest , is a member of a clandestine separatist group fighting for the liberation of Mir Ali from Pakistan . <p> The novel opens on the morning of Eid , and braids the past and the present , with the disparate aspirations of the three brothers , and works its way up to a finale that feels emotionally depleting . <p> " I started writing The Shadow of the Crescent Moon before Songs of Blood and Sword , though I was supposed to be working on a book about Karachi at the time , " Bhutto giggles in mock guilt . She had been reading several city books in preparation for this project that never took off . V.S.

Mina 's grief is the still centre of a world in flux ; her determination to commiserate with strangers for their loss remains unshaken in spite of society 's disapproval . Mina 's trials , together with her chilling confrontation with a group of Taliban soldiers in the middle of a forest , leap out of the novel with a force that renders whatever else is left of the plot dull and lifeless . <p> " I did not like Mina when I started writing her , " says Bhutto , when I tell her how moved I was by her story .

He is " tired of sacrificing and living among the ghosts of history " , has predictably fallen in love with Samarra , Aman Erum 's childhood sweetheart , after his own brother decided to shift his allegiances to the enemy camp , and deplores the " lazy generation " to which people like Aman Erum belonged ( " Freedom meant nothing to this generation .

The system will also allow government officials to immediately detect an irregular sale or disbursal of subsidy . <p> The new system will address a problem that India has grappled with little success for a long time .

" <p> The fertilizer department had to release subsidies in the absence of a way to confirm if the claims were fake or the states were just lethargic in verifying that the fertilizers have indeed reached the districts , said the official .

On an average , 4% of the claims failed to get approval from the states during those five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not be more than 1-2% but even those minuscule percentages translate into huge losses in absolute terms , said Ajay Vir Jakhar , chairman of the Bhartiya Krishak Samaj , a non-political farmers association . <p> Currently , the two systems are managed by different organizations .

The second , the Mobile Fertilizer Management System ( mFMS ) , has been designed and managed by the National Informatics Centre ( NIC ) -- an entity under the ministry of communications and information technology . <p> The end-to-end tracking system was developed to provide subsidy straight to the farmer instead of channeling it through fertilizer manufacturers as part of the direct benefit transfer ( DBT ) programme . <p> The move to implement the merger comes despite finance minister P.

@@2020239 <p> In a world where what we consume is getting increasingly full of polite , socially-approved and rather safe flavours , Zimbabwe 's home to both the complex and the unusual . If you 're on the tourist trail , around a national park especially , the first thing you learn is to be adventurous with your taste buds . Most buffets feature an assortment of acquired tastes . Think marinated crocodile , impala , kudu , wildebeest , buffalo and warthog fillet steaks , offered with baguette-seed rolls and garnished with lettuce and chips . On several occasions , I encounter a head chef haloed by wood-smoke and the sweet fragrance of roasting , beaming over his succulent preparations with as much pride as a child showing off his latest toys . <p> Every meat has its endemic seasoning . Impala , I 'm told , goes best with gravy or pepper sauce . Warthog , with barbeque sauce . As vital a presence as the range of meats to the meal , is the ubiquitous Mopane worm .

Sadza -- a thickened porridge made from maize -- is the staple . My chef tells me , ladling a huge portion onto my plate , " In my village , sadza , like all the other food , was served on a communal plate .

The Lutyens ' bungalows which insulate the ruling class from the people , the beacon bearing cars or the MP and MLA funds ?

Worse , it has to work under the burden of too many expectations . <p> The party also has too many inherent contradictions ; its vote base for one includes a sizeable section of have-nots clamouring for a better life . The party seems to be thinking that this hungry , impatient class will stand and wait for its turn . <p> Not to speak of the rapacious and not so scrupulous middle class which does n't think much of arrogating a major chunk of subsidies and salaries , while complaining about inflation and corruption and what have you . <p> It 's a delicious irony of sorts for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India through the ballot box and a chimera for chaotic India looking for salvation outside its old party system . <p> The country at best will only get another political party , not a socio-cultural transformation befitting modern India .

@@2029234 <h> The truth of India 's position at Bali <p> All that India achieved at Bali was to delay the day of judgment on our food support programme . <p> The outcome of the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) summit at Bali has been projected as a great victory for the Indian government by its spokespersons . Nothing could be farther from the truth . <p> In exchange for a temporary reprieve on its food support programme , India has bartered away the bargaining chip of trade facilitation , which Western negotiators demanded . The wide divergence between the initial stance of trade minister Anand Sharma and his final position at Bali underlines how far India was pushed to the wall by Western negotiators . India 's readiness to give up on its initial stance will only expose it to greater pressure from its trade partners during talks on a final settlement on agricultural subsidies . <p> All that India achieved at Bali was to delay the day of judgment on our food support programme . But even that victory seems to be a clumsy one . The interim agreement on food subsidies is problematic on a number of counts . For one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being dragged to the dispute settlement body if the subsidies are considered to impact global trade . For another , the agreement holds only for food support programmes that exist currently , limiting the scope of expansion in such programmes till a final settlement on the issue is reached . <p> India 's assent to the trade agreement is at odds with the current government 's policy of using the public procurement and distribution system to provide adequate food to two-thirds of citizens . It exposes once again the incoherent approach of the ruling United Progressive Alliance ( UPA ) government towards food security . For a government that has touted the so-called right to food as its key achievement , the climbdown at Bali in the face of external opposition suggests that it is not serious about its own stated objectives . The UPA 's hurried passage of the food law without considering its sustainability or its ramifications on India 's trade commitments can only be explained as political opportunism ahead of parliamentary elections . <p> The trade deal does offer a silver lining . It raises the hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provisions of the food security law to meet the constraints imposed by global trading rules , and still meet India 's welfare and strategic goals through innovative reforms . It is indeed possible to make a virtue out of a necessity in this case , and use this opportunity provided by the temporary reprieve at WTO to reform our food and welfare programmes . <p> India 's food policy has been lopsided for long , focusing on a handful of foodgrains at the expense of more nutritious food items and , in turn , driving malnutrition . The various subsidies the government offers to support agriculture are distortionary and regressive , benefiting richer farmers more than others , and harming soil diversity . The overall policy thrust of keeping food prices low while keeping farm gate prices high is itself self-defeating as it involves a complex subsidy regime that burdens the fisc and stokes inflation . <p> There is a case for an alternative way to protect the interest of both farming and non-farming poor alike , without creating as many distortions as the current system generates . The key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cash transfers , for both consumers and producers . Direct income support to farmers in lieu of the package of input subsidies and procurement support will not only help us build a non-distortionary farming system ; it will also be a more egalitarian and cost-effective alternative to help small farmers . Similarly , cash transfers to non-farming families in lieu of foodgrains will be far more efficient than a leaky distribution system . It is also more likely to encourage diet diversity . To start with , the government might consider providing a mix of cash and in-kind transfers before doing away with leaky food management infrastructure itself . <p> The powerful big farmers ' lobby will of course oppose any such move . But the stick of binding trade commitments can be deployed by a smart government to make them fall in line .

Men are much more highly valued than women . That has hardly budged : In the immediate aftermath of the Delhi rape , lawmakers declined to criminalize marital rape .

@@2049236 <h> Thorium and the dream of clean nuclear power <p> HONG KONG By David Lague <p> HONG KONG China is n't alone in turning to thorium as a potential source of power . Enthusiasm for exploiting this alternative to uranium is on the rise across the world , even as the cleanup continues from the Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan . <p> A new generation of scientists and nuclear engineers argue that thorium could be the key to realizing a dream of safe , cheap and plentiful nuclear power for an energy hungry world . <p> Thorium deposits , estimated to be about four times more abundant than uranium , are widely distributed : Substantial reserves have been found in China , Australia , the United States , Turkey , India , and Norway . About 6,600 metric tons ( 7.75.3 tons ) of thorium used to power the most efficient proposed reactors would provide enough energy to replace all of the fossil fuels and nuclear energy consumed globally each year , proponents say . <p> Uranium-poor India has a long-term research effort under way and has decided thorium will become the mainstay of its nuclear energy industry later this century . The French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , Australia , Norway and the Czech Republic are working on reactor designs or thorium fuel technology . <p> Energy from thorium is not just scientific theory . On April 25 , Thor Energy , a private Norwegian company , began producing power from thorium - named after the Norse god of thunder - at the Halden test reactor in Norway . <p> " It is the fundamental first step in the thorium evolution , " says company CEO Oystein Asphjell . The tests are aimed at showing the fuel could be a valuable alternative to uranium for existing reactor operators . Nuclear giant Westinghouse , a unit of Toshiba Corp , is part of an international consortium that Thor Energy established to fund and manage the experiments . <p> A Westinghouse spokesman said the company was " providing viewpoints " on the research . <p> Asphjell says burning thorium in current pressurized water reactors could boost safety and provide greater fuel security , especially for countries with limited access to uranium . Eventually , proponents want to pair thorium with a new kind of reactor , cooled not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , would realize thorium 's full potential as a fuel . <p> Thorium is a shiny , slightly radioactive metal . In its natural form , thorium is n't fissile - meaning that , in contrast to uranium , it ca n't split to sustain a nuclear chain reaction . <p> But if thorium is bombarded with neutrons from a small amount of fissile nuclear fuel acting as a starter , either uranium-235 or plutonium-239 , it is converted to uranium-233 - a form of uranium that is a first-rate nuclear fuel . Once started in a reactor , the process is self-sustaining , with subsequent fissions of uranium-233 in turn converting more thorium to nuclear fuel . <p> In the kind of molten-salt cooled reactor favored by many thorium proponents , the uranium-233 fuel would be dissolved in a coolant of liquid fluoride salts contained in a graphite core . Surrounding the core would be a blanket of thorium , also dissolved in liquid fluoride salts . <p> When the fuel in the core fissions , it produces heat and a barrage of neutrons that pass through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to uranium-233 . This is then removed from the blanket and fed into the core , while fresh thorium is supplied to the blanket . The coolant and fuel mixture from the reactor core is circulated through a heat exchanger , so that the energy can be extracted to power a turbine and generate electricity . <p> One advantage of this system is that the fluoride salt coolant has an extremely high boiling point of 1,400 degrees Celsius , far higher than the reactor 's operating temperature of about 750 degrees Celsius . That means the whole system can operate at close to normal atmospheric pressure . <p> In a conventional water-cooled reactor , the cooling system must be designed to withstand high pressure . That means reactors also must have massive , heavily engineered and expensive containment structures to minimize the danger from leaks or pressure explosions . <p> Because the core in a thorium molten-salt reactor is already liquid , it ca n't melt down . The design calls for a plug of frozen salt at the bottom of the system . If the reactor overheats , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a containment vessel below , where it would rapidly solidify and could be recovered for future use , proponents say . <p> These reactors could be much more efficient than most current nuclear plants , which extract between three and five percent of the energy in uranium fuel rods . In a molten salt reactor , almost all the fuel is consumed . <p> One metric ton of thorium fuel would deliver the same amount of energy as 250 metric tons of uranium in a pressurized water reactor , according to a briefing paper published by the United Kingdom All Party Parliamentary Group on Thorium , a group of UK lawmakers who advocate adoption of the alternative fuel . <p> Also , because most of the fuel is consumed , thorium yields little waste and is much less radioactive , proponents say . Most of the residue will become inert within 30 years , with about 17 per cent needing secure storage for about 300 years . <p> The most dangerous waste from current generation reactors requires storage for 10,000 years . <p> The molten-salt reactor may have one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to burn off existing nuclear waste . <p> A privately owned U.S. start-up , Transatomic Power of Cambridge , Massachusetts , says it plans to build molten salt cooled reactors to burn some of the 270,000 metric tons of nuclear waste accumulated worldwide .

@@2049240 <h> Rating : <p> With its appealing spread of animated " foodimals " , animals made entirely of food , in an array of contrasting colours , Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2 is an entertaining tale of recognition , adventure and commitment that would appeal to kids . <p> The film takes off from where its first edition , released in 2009 , left . Nevertheless , it is not a must to view the earlier edition , since the trail of events are explained and the film is clear on its own . <p> The narration trails an inspired and ambitious inventor , Flint Lockwood ( Bill Hader ) , who is in awe of a celebrated scientist , Chester V ( Will Forte ) . <p> Flint is keen to join Chester V 's company Live Corp as a ' Think-o-nought ' scientist . But the scheming scientist has other ideas . He plans to steal Flint 's previous invention , a machine that converts water into food , which was thought to be destroyed but is now actually creating havoc in the ecosystem by churning out , " living food " creatures . <p> Chester V does this by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and friends - the brave meteorologist sort-of girlfriend Sam Sparkwood ( Anna Faris ) ; the gruff , by-the-book town cop ( Terry Crews ) ; and the comical Steve ( Neil Patrick Harris ) , the talking monkey . <p> He tells Flint : " Your friends are distracting you from the mission . Be focused to be a hero . " And Flint ponders . <p> These animations are unique and extraordinarily dramatic , making it a visual delight . Unfortunately , the 3D effects really do not elevate the viewing experience . <p> The aptly matched voices rendered by the cast add a bounce to the characters . The speech is cleverly written . Pun-filled dialogues like , " My word is a hologram " , and " There is a leek ( leak ) in the boat " cheekily caters to kids . <p> Though the film is based on an interesting concept of " foodimals " , the storyline with its twist and turns is devoid of intelligence and emotion . The scheme of events is very familiar and there is hardly any incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The narration meanders from a clever sophisticatedly created sci-fi setting to a frivolously inconsequential Jurassic Park caricature which further converges into an exciting " Avatar " style nature versus machines battle . <p> Overall , with a generic villain and robot henchmen and world domination goals , Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2 is a children-centric film that lacks the punch .
