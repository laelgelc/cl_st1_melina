The excuse of saying you do n't know what type of supplements you are taking is sketchy . <p> I have a question to ask those of you reading this now- Would you take something having no idea what it is if someone offered it to you ? ...... I believe many of you if not all would say " No I would n't take it are you crazy ? it could be poison or harmful to my health . " <p> So now do you believe Manny Pacquiao a grown man is naive enough to take supplements that he has no idea what they are or what they do and could be harmful to his health ? <p> If a man does n't even take aspirin and is cautious of what type of medications , foods or drinks he eats , how believable is it that he would take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditioning trainer Alex Ariza without even knowing what they were ? <p> IT JUST DOESN " T MAKE SENSE ! <p> How could a man who is very particular on what he puts into his body all of a sudden take a supplement that his conditioning coach Alex Ariza gives him and Ariza claims Pacquiao has no idea on what he is giving him . <p> Something here just does n't make any sense at all and I would advise Freddie Roach and Manny Pacquiao to know what type of supplements they are using because many supplements are not regulated by the FDA and may contain steroids or PEDS ( performance enhancing drugs ) . <p> Roy Jones Jr . who tested positive for Steroids ( androstenedione ) in the past said he never took steroids knowingly and only took a muscle building supplement from GNC or some health store called Ripped Fuel which contained some type of pro-hormones at the time . <p> I have been thinking about the Floyd Mayweather Jr . and Manny Pacquiao drug testing dispute for a couple of days since the news broke . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplements from the FDA , many of these supplements were being sold at reputable vitamin and supplement shops and were pulled off of the shelves because of having steroids or illegal ingredients in them . <p> So I decided to go to the local supplement store in the mall that sells bodybuilding and muscle building supplements to check out what type of supplements Manny Pacquiao could be taking without knowing the ingredients inside them . <p> I looked around and I came across this supplement called DARK RAGE what stood out to me was the advertising on the container it said EPO BLOOD DOPING TECHNOLOGY . Pro Bodybuilders have secretly been using the powerful hormone erythropoietin ( EPO ) to increase muscle pumps , size , strength and endurance . MHP 's new next generation pre-workout formula blows the cover on this closely guarded secret with a patent pending EPO technology . <p> EPO is what Victor Conte of BALCO gave Sugar Shane Mosley before his boxing match with Oscar De La Hoya . EPO is tested only through the blood and is very difficult to track . Seeing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question what type of products are Pacquiao and Ariza using . <p> The state athletic commissions need to tighten their restriction on the usage of muscle building and performance enhancing supplements . Many of these supplements taken a few hours before a fight can give a fighter an extra boost he needs to beat his opponent . <p> The majority of these supplements are not FDA approved or regulated and many of these over the counter supplements have been recalled for having tested positive in lab studies for steroids and illegal substances . <p> I have to side with Mayweather on this issue , you are dealing with the fight game , a game where people die yearly or suffer life changing injuries . <p> It is a violent sport and if another fighter is taking some type of enhancers they could literally murder their opponent in the ring or do some permanent damage with the extra help from such supplements . <p>

@@1701236 <h> Focus <p> Posted on 06:51 PM , November 04 , 2010 <p> BY JEFFREY O. VALISNO , Sub-Editor <h> The ratings game <p> From all indications , being in the local television industry is like being in a battlefield . The competition is fierce , with each of the top three commercial , free-to-air TV networks claiming to be winning the battle for ratings supremacy in one form or another . <p> The network war between Lopez-led ABS-CBN Corp . and listed GMA Network Inc. , escalated over the past six years , as the " Kapuso " channel effectively managed to catch up to -- and eventually overtake -- the " Kapamilya " channel 's long-standing foothold in the viewer-rich Metro Manila and nearby provinces ( called Mega Manila ) starting in 2004 . <p> Still , ABS-CBN was able to keep its lead as the most-watched TV network nationwide , despite successful efforts of GMA Network in recent years to infiltrate the Visayas and Mindanao in order to attract more loyal supporters outside Mega Manila . <p> Just when things seemed like they could not get any more intense , TV5 made its presence felt aggressively over the past 12 months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a revitalized TV5 triumphantly maneuvered a three-cornered siege for ratings domination . <p> Suddenly , all the gloves are off , and an all-out , full-scale battle for ratings superiority has erupted amid growing pressure to keep Filipinos glued to their TV sets instead of wandering on the Internet . <p> Size matters <p> More than a measure of popularity , TV ratings are a measure of audience size . If a program gets a rating of 15 , that means that 15% of households in the survey area were watching it , averaged across all the minutes when it was being broadcast . <p> Ratings can be either for a particular time , or averaged across programming blocs -- such as an average primetime rating from 6 p.m. to 12 a.m . Ratings can also be measured through households -- which yields information on who watches which TV programs based on socioeconomic class , age , sex , and so on . <p> Ratings are valuable tools that advertisers use as a guide for their decisions on where to air their commercials , which in turn , generates income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to decide which shows to keep and which to cancel . <p> " TV ratings indicate whether or not the TV programs aired are being watched and by how many viewers . GMA Network , like the other stations , bases the performance of their programs on the ratings generated by the shows vis- ? -vis competition , " GMA Network said in a statement furnished BusinessWorld . " Advertisers monitor the ratings of TV programs , apart from the format , etc. , and they base their decisions on where to place the volume of their TV ads on the ratings performance of the programs . " <p> Because of this , it became imperative for TV networks to assert their claims of being the #1 channel as part of their strategy to attract more advertisers , and generate more advertising revenues -- the single biggest source of income for TV networks . <p> " We use TV ratings to understand what viewers prefer to watch . We use the data to determine what programs to produce and what time or channel to slot them in , " Vivian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ABS-CBN , told BusinessWorld in an e-mail . <p> AGB Nielsen Media Research is a joint venture formed by the AGB Group and the TV audience measurement ( TAM ) business of the Nielsen Company in March 2005 . The company has been providing TAM data for Philippine broadcasters and advertisers since 1992 as Nielsen Media Research , and from 1999 as AGB Philippines . It then provided a panel of viewers that covered Metro Manila and all urban areas of Rizal , Laguna , Cavite , and Bulacan , and some parts of Pampanga . <p> In 2006 , AGB Nielsen Media Research established the first national TAM panel , which covers 95% of all urban areas of the country , with a population of more than 34 million individuals . <p> Meanwhile , Kantar Media set up its TAM panel in the Philippines thru TNS at the start of 2007 . It officially started releasing its national TV audience measurement data in February last year . <p> ABS-CBN currently subscribes to the data provided by Kantar Media , while GMA Network and TV5 are both subscribers to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to subscribe to both Nielsen and Kantar Media . It was GMA chairman and chief executive Atty . Felipe L. Gozon who personally invited TNS to provide TV ratings services to the Network . However , because of unresolved issues raised by GMA against Kantar Media , both companies mutually agreed to end the contract for Kantar Media 's services in 2009 , " GMA Network said . <p> " GMA Network subscribes to Nielsen because it has a bigger panel of TV households nationwide compared with Kantar Media , " GMA Network said . " It is also the more widely recognized TV ratings data supplier in the country and provides TV ratings data to at least 24 local companies including GMA Network and another TV channel ( not ABS-CBN ) . Top media agencies plus six regional clients likewise subscribe to AGB Nielsen . On the other hand , according to sources , ABS-CBN is the sole subscriber to TNS . " <p> Perci Intalan , TV5 head of creative and entertainment production said they decided to rely on AGB Nielsen ratings reports because " it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have to know what most advertisers want , so we chose AGB Nielsen , " Mr. Intalan told BusinessWorld in an interview . <p> ABS-CBN used to subscribe to AGB Nielsen , but it transferred to Kantar Media after the network charged the media research company of allegedly tampering with ratings data in favor of GMA Network during the last quarter of 2007 . <p> ABS-CBN accused GMA Network of allegedly funding bribery operations in Bacolod City . The Lopez-led company even presented two former GMA Network employees who claimed that GMA Network head for radio operations and news anchor Mike Enriquez allegedly gave the order to cheat . <p> Mr. Enriquez immediately denied the charges in news reports , saying that the statements were " shameless , malicious fiction delivered by tainted informers with an axe to grind . " For its part , GMA Network filed a P15-million civil libel suit against ABS-CBN in January 2008 . <p> " ABS-CBN shifted to Kantar Media/TNS after filing a case versus AGB Nielsen Media Research for failing to comply with its request to investigate alleged cheating and data tampering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court , " ABS-CBN head for corporate communications Bong R. Osorio told BusinessWorld in an e-mail . <p> " We currently subscribe to Kantar Media , which is a global market research group that offers audience research measurement systems in 32 countries , " he added . <p> To quell suggestions that it dropped the survey company because its data was unfavorable to the network , Ms. Tin pointed out that ABS-CBN had stayed with AGB Nielsen even when it reported that the network lost in Mega Manila in 2004 . " We do n't care if we win or lose . What we care is about getting the correct data in order to make the right decisions for the viewers and the advertisers , " she said . <p> " If a panel becomes unrepresentative and stops reflecting the viewing of people in general , it will be a big disservice to the people because an unrepresentative panel will give wrong information and will lead TV networks to produce programs that people will not really want to see . This will hurt the viewers . It will also lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertising . This can be damaging to the business of advertisers , " she added . <p> Disparate ratings <p> Not surprisingly , each network emphasizes the data that make them look better . Thus the Kapamilya channel of the Lopezes crows that it tops the national ratings as reported by Kantar Media , while the Kapuso Channel points out that leads in the Mega-Manila ratings being released by AGB Nielsen . <p> Recently GMA Network said it has pulled away from the competition in Mega Manila and Urban Luzon TV ratings with its TV programs dominating the list of top shows for the week of Oct. 11 to 17 . <p> It posted an average audience share of 39% in Mega Manila for the said period , a huge 10.5 percentage points higher than its main rival 's 28.5% . Mega Manila comprises 55% of the total urban household population nationwide . <p> " Nineteen out of the top 30 overall TV programs in Mega Manila for the said week were from GMA with the top four programs all GMA Telebabad ( primetime ) offerings . The Rhian Ramos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top spot with 14.9 people rating points , while the fantaserye Grazilda led by Glaiza de Castro followed at number two with 13.6 points , " GMA Network said . <p> It said the same story goes for the " Total Urban Luzon " segment of the AGB Nielsen TAM data , which comprises 77% of the total urban TV households in the country . GMA Network said it has increased its lead in the area with an average total day audience share of 37% , up by 6.4 percentage points over competition 's 30.6% based on partial October data ( Oct. 1-17 ) . <p> Meanwhile , according to the overnight TAM report among national households by Kantar Media , on Oct. 12-14 , ABS-CBN primetime programs dominated the list , with the fantasy-drama series Noah leading the pack with 36.4% , followed by the early evening newscast TV Patrol with 33.5% , and the drama series Immortal with 32.9% . <p> " ABS-CBN is leading nationally in the Philippines because our programs are able to address the needs and wants of most Filipinos . Our shows are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's everyday lives , " Ms. Tin said . <p> But GMA Network said ABS-CBN is highlighting its national ratings results in its press releases because it is always behind in the ratings in Mega Manila . <p> " GMA 's competitor has stopped releasing data in Mega Manila and focused on releasing the nationwide survey results because they have been consistently losing in TV ratings in Mega Manila since 2004 , " GMA Network said . <p> ABS-CBN 's Ms. Tin argued that they are lagging behind GMA Network in Mega Manila because of signal problems . " ABS-CBN has reception problems in Mega Manila . We have been addressing this problem and we believe that reception will improve as we shift to digital TV , " she said . <p> Still , Ms. Tin pointed out that ABS-CBN continues to dominate nationwide ratings reports . " Data show ABS-CBN is the number one TV station in the country . Other networks would highlight their leadership in select areas , while others will drumbeat their leadership in select timeslots . Bottom line , they ca n't claim national leadership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . <p> Ms. Tin said leading the national ratings race is more important , since most advertisers need to appeal to everybody because they sell their products nationwide , not just in Metro Manila and nearby provinces . " Brands of most advertisers are sold nationally and not just in Mega Manila . And we are called the Philippines , not Mega Manila , " she emphasized . <p> Because of this Ms. Tin said more advertisers prefer to place their commercials on ABS-CBN shows . " More advertisers prefer ABS-CBN as 43% of viewers under classes ABCD , which comprise 75% of the total population with purchasing power , watch ABS-CBN as compared to GMA with only 34% , " Ms. Tin said . <p> GMA Network admits that it is behind ABS-CBN in the national ratings race , but it says that it is slowly catching up to its rival . " While GMA leads in Mega Manila and Urban Luzon , it is still behind in Visayas and Mindanao , which affects its overall nationwide ratings performance . Nonetheless , competition has been seeing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by just 0.5 points in people ratings based on the Oct. 1 to 17 National Urban Households survey of Nielsen , " the network said . <p> " GMA 's competitor has been in the provinces for so many years , whereas GMA only began to improve its signal and reach as well as pour in aggressive promos in the key regional areas a few years ago . The Network understands that it would take time and effort to break the loyalty of the viewers to ABS-CBN in the south . Now that GMA enjoys superior signal and reach in key areas nationwide , the Network hopes that the viewers will be able to appreciate its programming better . " <p> GMA Network credits its success in attracting TV audiences to the great attention that it gives in making sure that programs appeal to their market . <p> " When the new management , led by Atty . Felipe Gozon took over in late 2000 , the goals of the Network changed as Atty . Gozon believed that GMA can beat its rival in TV ratings and profits . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GMA began to compete head-on with its rival 's TV shows . Towards the end of 2003 , GMA led in total day Mega Manila TV ratings and has consistently led its rival thereafter , " the network said . <p> " GMA Network maintains a programming committee which analyzes the programming landscape , discusses and approves program concepts , tackles potential threats , monitors program ratings , etc ... The Network likewise has designated one whole department to analyze the content of produced programs vis- ? -vis competition . " <p> " We have been providing media research information for more than 10 years . I think we have already established our credibility in providing the right information , " Mr. Bautista told BusinessWorld in a telephone interview . <p> Mr. Bautista said Nielsen 's TAM report serves as a benchmark for the industry . " Our reports are a currency service . Our data is being used in buying and selling media , " he said . <p> Gabriel V. Buluran , Kantar Media general manager , told BusinessWorld in a telephone interview that they also guarantee that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Filipinos . " <p> " But what I can say is that we at Kantar Media do not limit our reports just to protect our subscribers . We release Mega Manila ratings results with ABS-CBN losing out against GMA . It is fine with ABS-CBN , unlike other stations . " <p> Three 's company <p> While ABS-CBN and GMA Network were at each other 's throats , TV5 slipped into the skirmish . Its talent search Talentadong Pinoy , hosted by Ryan Agoncillio , crawled into the list of top-rating weekend programs during the first quarter of last year . The show , which airs Saturday and Sunday evenings , soon became the highest-rated show of TV5 . <p> Then , last September , for two consecutive Saturdays , TV5 managed to snag the No. 2 ratings slot . <p> According to Ray C. Espinosa , TV5 president and chief executive , AGB Nielsen said that on Sept. 18 , among Mega Manila households , TV5 received an audience share of 24.6% from 6 p.m. to 2 a.m . That same day , GMA Network remained the dominant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished third with 21.3% . Mr. Espinosa said the same scenario happened the following Saturday , Sept. 25 , when TV5 again finished second in the ratings game . <p> Roberto " Bobby " V. Barreiro , TV5 's executive vice-president and chief operating officer , said network executives were " pleasantly surprised " by the developments . " We aimed to be number one in five years ( 2014 ) , but we all knew it will be a very tough climb knowing very well that our competitors are very well entrenched , " Mr. Barreiro told reporters . " But we did not expect that we will be number two within our first year in handling TV5 . We thought we 'll be number two in three years . " <p> Mssrs . Espinosa and Barreiro are part of the new management team led by Mr. Pangilinan which took over TV5 late last year .

" But in terms of monthly average , GMA Network 's shows beat Talentadong Pinoy which only managed to secure the fifth slot , behind four top-rating GMA weekend programs including Imbestigador , Kapuso Mo Jessica Soho , Pepito Manaloto , and Kap 's Amazing Stories . " <p> GMA Network added that the Pangilinan-led TV station " remains a far third in TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it will prove very difficult for TV-5 to climb up in ratings significantly in the near future .

But we know the secret is looking at the audience . "

Many candidates for punong barangay ( barangay captain ) are the children or relatives of the local mayor or councilors . It is also a stepping stone for future municipal and congressional leaders . Many members of Congress started their political career in the barangay . Candidates for barangay posts -- totaling 336,200 -- also receive backing from congressmen and other local politicians who seek to maintain their power base particularly during elections . <p> These practices make the barangays ' **25;328;TOOLONG " non-partisanship " and " independence " a farce and infuse their elections with the highly-partisan , personality-oriented , and fraud- and violence-ridden elements seen in the national and local polls .

Clan politics in the barangay where elections are dominated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and these serve either as appendage or extension by kinship of bigger political dynasties . <p> Ineffective tools <p> Reduced to playing the role as political mechanisms of traditional politicians , barangays in the main have not become effective tools for community government in a manner that makes governance accessible to the people . If at all convened , the barangay assembly which serves as the interactive consultative forum between the local government on the one hand and the residents and NGOs , on the other , is just pro forma with decision making on major plans largely made by the barangay executives . The local government code mandates the barangay to institute people empowerment mechanisms through the boards of health , women , and human rights but hardly is this followed . <p> Aside from supplying votes for influential politicians during national and local elections , the barangay through its peace council is used as a tool for counter-insurgency .

In this program , barangays bear the brunt of militarization and human rights violations that have enraged both local and international human rights groups . <p> Economic development , not a priority <p> The barangay is touted as the frontline unit for combating poverty and addressing basic social services like health and education . However , in general economic development such as livelihood programs receives no priority in barangay development funds ( BDFs ) . Programs , activities , and projects ( PAPs ) are often equated with barangay hall improvement , new basketball courts , " beautification , " and other infrastructures that have superficial impact on the community 's economy or to " conferences " and " seminars " that are actually a front for junkets . Corruption in the form of kickbacks laces these PAPs including those funded by pork barrel funds given to favored barangays . <p> In the end , community residents are left in the dark on how funds are spent since many barangay units do not publish any report as the local government code demands . Many residents are unaware that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of total government revenues ; 20 percent of the internal revenue allotment ( IRA ) ; 30 percent of community tax collections ; 25-35 percent of real property tax ; and other revenues derived from barangay clearances and business permits .

Opportunities for making governance participatory are lost and so are favorable conditions for human growth and strengthening public trust in government .

This was dictated by the rise in confidence for the DMCI Homes brand , " Civil adds . <p> He also emphasized that the company 's philosophy of focusing on the needs of their end users paid off well , since on-time delivery is critical to this segment . <p> " We do n't over-promise .
