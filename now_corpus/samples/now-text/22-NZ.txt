I may in fact be wrong at everything I do . This , if true , however , does not make me a bad person . At this moment I am quite sure in my own mind that if the RV 's go up in an area , which they do when prices rise , like they have , then the council uses this new set of increased RV 's to raise the rates . If I am wrong then please educate me ? <p> Your comment " the council uses this new set of increased RV 's to raise the rates " is wrong . <p> Increase in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - rather increases come from rises in budgeted costs . RVs are just used to apportion some of costs to individual properties - other costs are fixed charges per property . Increases in RVs do not influence total council rate take - RVs are not considered until after any rise in total rate take has been determined . <p> Correct . Any increase in total rate take comes from the budgeting process ( ie planned expenditure ) and once that process is complete rates for individual properties are based on fixed charges plus apportioned on the RV . It is quite possible that an individual property RV can increase but that actual rates for that property to decrease as has happened to me - such a situation can arise when total council rate increase is low and one 's % increase in RV is below the average . <p> If you have any knowledge or experience of local body politics and elections you will know that rate increases are the most commonly contentious and usually the most common issue . Out of self interest rate payers do not like rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to limit increases . Goff needing to promise limits to rate increases is a good illustration of that . <p> An increase ( or decrease ) will depend on whether your RV goes up more proportionally than the average increase . Word is many of the lower houses in our area jumped proportionally more than the high end ... that could sting . <p> Sitting on the budgeting side is the general trend of councils to do more , the wave of renewals costs that come up as aging infrastructure needs replacing and propensity of central government/people to expect higher and higher standards . Two examples at the moment being earthquake strenthening and Asia deciding they do nt want our recycling . <p> Councils are subject to all the usual inflations and particularly vulnerable to constructure inflation . The way construction inflation went in last 2 years I 'd expect some tough times at the decision making table when the next budgets are set . <p> Whatever it is , all of those stats &amp; headlines currently in Australia , will give cause to NZ 's government to continue with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no weaponry in the fight against omicron beyond that of Australia 's . The government here will not entertain for a moment the prospect of the same outcomes . <p> They either are just in a panic without a plan or are hoping it slips though MIQ and they can avoid some responsibility . We just started the last mandateable mRNA vaccine round ( it will will last for 2-3 months tops ) . They can maybe offer one or two more Pfizers ( regardless of omicron rework ) . The time is now or very soon if they want to secure RAT tests first . Continuing to down the boarders after the omicron wave in Aus is over will not poll well . <p> No , think they accept omicron will get into the community but keeping the border closed will somewhat restrict the intensity &amp; speed of that . They are terrified of the lesson Delta handed out when they were pressured to open up with Australia last year &amp; Auckland had to bear again , a protracted lockdown . Yes vaccination is now largely achieved here but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of approved academics here , laying the publicity , the groundwork in the media , that omicron will roar through here with the same devastating affect that is being highly publicised . Think that they would see politically , continuing with border closure as the lesser evil . Therefore the delaying action will continue . Be that as it may , Omicron will inevitably arrive nationwide en force , and the real danger now is this will coincide with NZ 's winter . <p> The wave will be mostly over six weeks after its starts unless it spreads poorly in NZ , which I think there is evidence for and would be good . Then , about a month after that there will be no need for any restrictions . The electorate will rebel against continued lock-downs for a cold . We are talking a 1 to 5% mortality risk of delta . <p> You have my vote , I think the border should be open now . But the pre-signalling from the usual approved academics ( Baker , Davis for instance ) &amp; now ED clinicians too boot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the border will be disastrous and accordingly the government is not indicating any retreat from its long-standing " canutish " policy . As well , opening up and then having to slam things shut once again at short or any notice , would be a train wreck politically and they know it . There will simply be repetition of " you can all see what 's happening in Australia and we need to protect you all from that etc etc . Appreciate poor old Canute 's actual purpose is readily misquoted , but unlike him , the government will not give up the ship they have been on for nigh on two years , ie hold covid back at all costs . But it would be highly pleasing to be proven wrong . <p> Arithmetic is not my friend . Taking that to mean the vaccine is not effectively decreasing hospitalisations then ? If so that does not bode well here then , where the ratio per person for ICUs is below that of Australia . <p> High-profile boss of JPMorgan Chase , Jamie Dimon , said overnight he expects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , based on the resilience of the US economy and American household balance sheets <p> I am sure Dimon is not in possession of a comprehensive understanding of the intricacies of financial market fundamentals , just as my former bosses at Chemical Bank London were not . Nonetheless , they undertook the takeover of Chase Manhattan Bank and then JP Morgan by purchasing shares ( securities ) in the market place and crediting the sellers ' bank accounts with nothing more than a record of what Chemical Bank owed them . <p> Whenever the interest rate are raised or fed does tapering , market is going to react adversely , so early the better they realize to remove ventilator , which as it is should be in emergency only and that too for short term unlike fed who became comfortable for two years as was easy thing to do and had support from their political master , who too were thinking short term . <p> Now what ? ? ? ? This situation is doing of reserve bank and politicians as anything in extreme is fatal be it medecine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to middle-earners who are propertyless and shut out from owning their own golden goose . I am not surprised they are furious . They could have seriously tightened credit in other areas instead - e.g. second homes , rentals etc .. <p> Jfoe how was the ladder not already pulled up from low to middle class earners ? Average house price $1,000,000 ? The actions from the RBNZ ( QE , removal of LVR etc ) and the inaction from Govt destroyed housing affordability . The market is so distorted it needs to come back ... <p> I think the banks are deliberately being ridiculous to prove that needless regulation can cause adverse reactions . It 's not a good look for the government when your bank noses through your day to day life so much . I 'm surprised so many commentators here think this is a good thing , they probably want the government to wipe their bum too . <p> If this does happen , and I think it is a quite likely scenario , the repercussions to fixed international rates and ultimately to the cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see interest rates in NZ going up more than predicted , with significant risks to the NZ housing Ponzi . It will be a rude awakening for many mortgage holders , especially the more delusional ones who , against all evidence and contrary to what current swap rates are strongly indicating , still hope that interest rates will go down in the future . <p> It 's not about whether RBNZ / government allowing it happens or not . They simply do n't have choice on this . Same as other banks . Even our OCR stays , the cost of borrowing will still go up as US tightening up their monetary policy . Housing Market or the reputation of our currency ? I think RBNZ and government will always choose the second one . I respect your different view . But I think your wish of OCR coming down blinds you from seeing the reality of what 's happening around the world right now . I 'm not saying it will never come down , but it will likely stay high for quite a bit time before it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved into one part of the cycle , it will take a while to move out of it . <p> What is the minimum floor area for a room to be advertised as a bedroom ? <p> For example , does a room that is 2.2m wide by 3.2m long , plus a small wardrobe over and above that , count as a bedroom ? Assuming it has a window . This can fairly easily fit a single bed plus a few small bits of furniture , I recall this being about the size of my younger brother 's bedroom when I was growing up . <p> The Housing Improvement Regulations say a bedroom must have at least 6 sq . m of floor area and be at least 1.8m wide . <p> Our 3 bedroom townhouse is 104 square metres - 52 each level ( 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms upstairs ) . One option is to wall off part of the L shaped living room area on the ground floor , into a small bedroom / study . <p> The ground floor living would then go from about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ m . Which is pretty compact , but not at all terrible . <p> I guess the question is how much value we would gain by going from 3 to 4 bedrooms , on the downside the living room size decreases which I imagine would have some counteracting effect in terms of valuation . <p> But one of the larger upstairs bedrooms could be used as a TV room , or study / home office for someone who only needed 3 bedrooms . With more remote working there must be value in having more rooms ? <p> We would n't do it now , but looking ahead a couple of years if we potentially look at selling . <p> Despite the living room shrinking , my gut feel would be there would be significant up-valuation . Possibly from a valuation of circa 950K to 1,050,000 . <p> Thanks . I guess whether it 's more or less appealing as an owner- occupier would depend on your needs . Although I would miss the living room space , I would conversely appreciate a 4th bedroom which I could use as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local agent on the pretext you 're considering selling post-reno .

I 've actually warmed to TA lately , his opinions seem way more balanced and i actually have learnt a couple of things from his most recent articles . This guy on the other hand ... bottom of the barrel stuff with a smirk that makes you want to vomit . <p> Many FHBs are bitter about investors , I know I was .

" <p> The conference was split into four sessions , with " Applying the science " first up . Professor Hilary Clayton presented the keynote lecture on how the rider affects the welfare and performance of the ridden horse . She explained how rider asymmetry or a rider who is too large can compromise performance , how the synchronisation of movement with the horse is often lacking especially among less skilled riders , and how better performance is associated with minimal disruption by the rider . <p> Professor Heikki Handroos then showed how engineering science has been applied to develop a new generation of riding simulators that are able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those currently available on the market , to benefit riders at every level . <p> In the second session of the day , " Through the lens " , leading veterinary authority on gait analysis , Dr Filipe Serra Bragan ? a discussed the significant advances in technology for sophisticated objective analysis of gait for research purposes and clinical use . <p> Dr Russell MacKechnie-Guire presented on the topic of saddle fitting and whether an objective approach is useful or misleading . He pointed out that thermography is not a reliable tool for the assessment of saddle fit for the horse . His take-home advice was to keep it simple , for example by using markers placed on the horse , saddle and rider and using a smartphone to take videos . <p> Dr Marie Dittmann went on to look at the high prevalence of ill-fitting saddles in Swiss riding horses and the subsequent potential for compromised performance .

This demonstrates that competitors are likely to have greater competition success with comfortable/sound horses and that we have a moral responsibility to improve welfare and performance by recognising a problem , identifying the cause and treating it . <p> Dr Rachel Murray went on to look at the importance of bridle fit , noting that there is little research on bridle fit for optimal welfare and performance .

Like if you were n't at a show , you did n't hear so it did n't happen for you . <p> S : It was all raw energy , the madness was encouraged and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> S : You had to turn up . <p> T : And if you did n't go to the shows , it was really important to read the reviews because it was n't like everyone had a camera phone so you could just look at the photos on Instagram . So , you made an effort to go out . It was more active in that you really had to be there for stuff to happen . <p> And that makes the live context so much more important . I remember coming up from Dunedin one time and seeing you guys play at I guess Edens Bar , and you were stomping on each other 's pedals , and that 's only going to happen live . <p> T : And we used to do that a lot . <p> It 's the freedom to fuck around . <p> T : And the thing that I like about that is that it is amazing to see how people handle things that are n't planned . Bands practice like crazy . <p> S : But we are n't scared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unpredictable space . Yeah bo bands practice to get everything perfecto but we do n't know what is going to happen . There 's honesty and excitement in having that type of freedom . <p> Is that also because you 've been playing together for ages , and you have absolute trust ? <p> S : Yeah ages , we are on the same page , riding the same wave . <p> T : And it 's about ourselves . It 's fun for us . That is where the fun part is playing with each other in a sense of we do n't know what is going to happen . Instead of we are playing with the crowd , and we will play very good . It 's like we are fucking with each other , and we are having a laugh . This shit 's comedy . <p> S : Stand-up . <p> T : It has to be ' cause if you 're gon na be serious you 're gon na be like , what is this ? <p> S : you 're gon na be disappointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're not having a laugh , there 's not much point . What are you going to do ? Go home and give yourself a pat on the back " wow great show tonight " ? We usually just say , oh that was funny af when you did that " you 're a funny beep " . That 's what we talk about after we play . <p> You do n't want be watching and band and know someone 's going to be told off ' cause they messed up a bit . <p> The last question is , what do you find motivating about your community ? <p> T : We have one . <p> I was thinking how if it 's a Coolies show , that you know it 's going to be a big catch-up . <p> T : Yeah , I feel like after all this time we have a certain crowd . <p> S : Our mates , that 's our community . <p> T : And we definitely choose the shows we play . We are n't out there looking to book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does feel like a coming together of people that you have n't seen in ages . <p> Your last show felt like that . I was looking at some of the photos of the European tour and it was the same as that Krd show where you were playing in the middle of the room and the audience is around you and that 's immediate . <p> T : And that just keeps us going . <p> S : It 's sustaining , close to home , get involved , keep in touch , to die for ... kinda thing . <p> T : The band keeps going with the community that supports us , I mean they 're our friends pretty much .

@@33662232 <h> Weebit Nano demonstrates its first crossbar ReRAM arrays <p> Weebit Nano Limited ( ASX:WBT ) , a leading developer of next-generation memory technologies for the global semiconductor industry , has together with its development partner CEA-Leti , demonstrated its first operational crossbar arrays that combine its ReRAM technology with a selector . This is a key milestone on the company 's path to creating discrete ( stand-alone ) non-volatile memory ( NVM ) chips . <p> Discrete memory chips consist of large arrays of memory cells , from Megabit ( Mb or one million bits ) to multi-Gigabit ( Gb , or one billion bits ) in size . They therefore require very high densities to contain as much memory as possible on the same piece of silicon . <p> The 1T1R ( one transistor one resistor ) architecture used in embedded ReRAM arrays is not sufficient to support the large arrays of memory cells needed in discrete ( stand-alone ) memory chips since transistors are too big . For this reason , Weebit 's crossbar arrays were developed using a 1S1R ( one selector one resistor ) architecture that enables the high density needed for discrete chips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be stacked in 3D layers so they can deliver even higher densities . <p> Weebit 's 1S1R crossbar ReRAM architecture has potential applications in storage class memory , persistent memory and as a NOR flash replacement .

As part of this work , we recently filed several new patents together with CEA-Leti , designed to further protect Weebit 's ReRAM intellectual property , with a focus on 1S1R architectures and selector cell programming .

@@33668230 <p> Welcome to our first of these daily summaries in 2022 . Here are the key things you need to know before you leave work today . <p> MORTGAGE RATE CHANGES No changes to report today . <p> TERM DEPOSIT RATE CHANGES None here either . <p> SERVICE SECTOR STRUGGLES TO AVOID ZOMBIE STATUS The New Zealand services sector is now neither expanding nor contracting - and that is an improvement from November where is was definitely contracting . New order levels are still growing but the pace is slowing and quite quickly . Although the PSI tracks the NZIER 's QSBO , that latter confidence survey is far more negative than the PSI . In comparison , the local factory sector is still expanding at a reasonably healthy pace , just not services . The Red traffic light setting should n't affect too many actual businesses outside tourism and hospo , and they are turning into zombie sectors anyway ( kept alive only by taxpayers ) . <p> MAINTAINING A SUBSTANTIAL DISCOUNTThe carbon price has now risen to $75/NZU , a rise of about +$5 since the start of the year or +7% within 25 days , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is 1 tonne of CO2 equivalent . ) The EU Carbon Permit price is now at ? 84/tonne and is shifted also by the exchange rate , so it is now equivalent to NZ$142/NZU . A year ago the EU price was ? 33 or NZ$56/tonne . So since then the NZ$ price has risen from 44% of the EU price , to now where it is 53% of the EU price . <p> WHEN A -1.1% FALL IS ' GOOD ' We noted the awful -3.5% performance of the NZX50 last week in yesterday 's review . But we should note that the eight-company property sector in the NZX50 was down much less last week ( -1.1% ) and for the year is still up +1.9% . Last week 's worst listed property companies were Investore ( IPL , #37 ) down -2.1% and Stride ( SPG , #31 ) down -1.9% . <p> A LID ON ? Australian December CPI came in higher than anticipated , but not hugely higher . They say their consumer prices rose 3.5% in 2021 , above the expected 3.2% and higher than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transport costs kept the pressure on . Clothing and tech kept it restrained there . Given how much CPI increases have beaten forecasts in other countries , this Aussie report is n't extreme . But it is above their RBA target level , and rising . And it is the highest rate there since 2014 . <p> A SHARP RETREATAustralian business confidence fell sharply in December , according to the widely-watched NAB business sentiment report , as the spread of the Omicron variant threatened to dampen their economy 's post-lockdown momentum . The fall in business conditions was driven by the employment component , which fell despite strong jobs growth reported in official data , reflecting the complexity of their labour market situation as businesses faced growing worker shortages and the prospect of a ' shadow lockdown ' through the summer . <p> EYES ON THE RBA Keep an eye out for the RBA policy review at 4:30pm today . We will update this item if there is something substantial . Also we should note that there is significant event risk ahead in New Zealand on Thursday with our CPI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September ) . <p> A SOLID EXPANSION South Korea reported its Q4 GDP result today and it was impressive , up +4.1% and its fastest annual pace in 11 years . <p> SUSTAINABLE ? But some key commodity prices are just getting excessively frothy . Tin is at a new all-time high with another huge jump today . Nickel is even more frothy . Dr Copper is doing nothing however , although aluminium is making another run at it . Iron ore is beholden to China 's slowdown ( a bit like copper ) so is n't faring in all this froth . <p> LOCAL PANDEMIC UPDATE In NSW , there were 18,512 new community cases reported yesterday , a big increase from the prior day , now with 209,326 active locally-acquired cases , and 29 daily deaths . There are now 2,943 in hospital there and a record high . In Victoria they reported 14,836 more new infections yesterday , also a big rise . There are now 183,154 active cases in that state - and there were also 29 more deaths there too . Queensland is reporting 9,546 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , new cases have slipped to 1869 yesterday with 5 more deaths . The ACT has 904 new cases and one death , and Tasmania 643 new cases . Overall in Australia , 46,310 new cases have been reported so far although not all counts are in yet . In New Zealand , there were 37 cases stopped at the border , plus 25 new cases in the community . Testing shows 8 had Omicron . There are 467 active cases in isolation , a fall . More than 1 mln booster shots have now been given , 57% of those eligible . <p> GOLD FIRM In early Asian trading , gold is at US$1840 and up +US$7 from this time yesterday . <p> EQUITIES MOSTLY LOWER AGAIN Wall Street sank hard earlier today - and then it staged a rather remarkable recovery , with the S&amp;P500 ending up +0.3% . The recovery was even more pronounced on the NASDAQ , enough to draw out the cynics in full voice . But that has n't helped Tokyo which is down -2.1% in morning trade . Hong Kong is down -1.3% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early trade . The ASX200 has shed -2.4% in early afternoon trade , while the NZX50 's drop is a more restrained -0.3% near our close . <p> SWAPS STABLE We do n't have today 's closing swap rates yet . They are likely to be slightly softer . The 90 day bank bill rate is up +1 bp at 1.08% . The Australian Govt ten year benchmark bond rate is up +4 bps at 1.96% . The China Govt 10yr is down -1 bp at 2.70% . The New Zealand Govt 10 year bond rate is now at 2.55% and back above the earlier RBNZ fix for that 10yr rate at 2.54% ( down -1 bp ) . The US Govt ten year is now at 1.77% having fallen overnight and risen back to yesterday 's level now . <p> NZ DOLLAR STILL SOFT The Kiwi dollar has stayed down and is now lower at 66.9 USc . Against the Aussie we are still at 93.5 AUc giving up the overnight gains when the restrained CPI was released . Another jolt could come with the RBA announcement . Against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That means the TWI-5 is now just under 71.4 and marginally lower . <p> BITCOIN IN MINOR BUT VOLATILE RECOVERY Bitcoin has tried to stage a recovery of sorts today . It is now at US$36,062 and up +0.5% from this time yesterday . But it did slip to US$32,984 in between , so the recovery is larger from there . Volatility over the past 24 hours has been extreme at just over +/- 6.8% . <p> Remember we welcome robust , respectful and insightful debate . We do n't welcome abusive or defamatory comments and will de-register those repeatedly making such comments . Our current comment policy is here . <h> 2 Comments <p> Given how much CPI increases have beaten forecasts in other countries , this Aussie report is n't extreme . <p> Yes , but remember that these forecasts and reported metrics are almost impossible to compare across countries . They 're only directional at best . The RBA is a addicted to monetary inflation and the associated bubbles as any other . <p> Expect the next CPI result to be north of 6% .

@@33668232 <h> New Zealand is the happiest place in the world outside northern Europe , three places higher than Australia , five higher than the US . But we are less happy than three years ago . Brian Easton reviews the data to find why we are this happy <p> Public Policy / opinion <p> New Zealand is the happiest place in the world outside northern Europe , three places higher than Australia , five higher than the US . But we are less happy than three years ago . Brian Easton reviews the data to find why we are this happy <p> For nine years an international consortium of economists and statisticians have gathered together data from many countries on how individuals rate their life satisfaction , reporting their findings in a World Happiness Report . Each year they focus on a particular issue ; the 2021 report is on the impact of Covid . That is another column -- this one is more about some general issues of the determinants of happiness . <p> People self-rating their happiness/life satisfaction may seem a bit arbitrary . However , there is a lot of evidence that this subjective score can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ score may be a bit volatile . <p> A YouGov poll of people from 22 countries asked almost 10,000 individuals to self-rate their life satisfaction on a 0 to 10 scale . They averaged about 6.5 . ( Had it been in the survey , New Zealand would have been about 7.5 ; there would have been a couple of countries above us . ) <p> The econometricians then evaluated some of the factors which determined individual scores . Some were personal factors such as age . The older you were , the happier you were . The difference between an 18-24 year-old and someone over 65 was 0.6 points on the scale so the elderly were about 10 percent happier on a 6.5 score . When I first worked with such surveys , they showed young adults were happier that those in the middle of their lives -- say 40-year-olds . That curvature effect seems to be disappearing . Does that mean our young are increasingly more miserable ? Why ? <p> The gender factor once more showed males saying they were about 0.1 points less happy than females @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be surprised that people living alone scored 0.4 points lower . This is found in other surveys which ask about marital status ; as a rule , married people are happier than unmarried ones . Remember , these are averages and some people living alone will have communities of families and friends and be quite happy . For others it will be a greater trial . The same averaging applies to the married . <p> Allow a wry smile that parents are happier than non-parents with reported scores sitting 0.25 points above non-parents . There are times when it may not seem that way but on average ... <p> The research I am reporting was part of a review on the effects of work on wellbeing , so it was particularly interested in unemployment , finding the unemployed scored themselves a whopping 1.3 points -- say 20 percent -- lower . Those who ceased to look for jobs and were described as ' inactive ' were only half that . <p> We might ponder about a couple of possible conclusions . The first is that if unemployment rises , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Second , perhaps we could reduce the trauma by making unemployment less stressful . That is one of the purposes of the proposed social unemployment scheme . There are people who are unlikely ever to be unemployed and are vociferously antagonistic towards such a scheme . Not everyone of course , and the objectors also have to ignore that by making the worker move more easily between jobs and upgrading their skills , the scheme will benefit the labour market mobility and productivity . Perhaps those opposed to it have neoliberal attitudes . <p> Such results depend on what is asked and the quality of the responses . Unfortunately the survey did not ask about income . So I just mention here that when it is asked for , it seems that those with higher incomes are happier . But the effect is not as great as the effects from other factors which I reported above : a higher income does not seem to add as much to happiness as , say , being ' married ' . <p> The one exception to this income effect is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- are markedly unhappier and a state income transfer would improve their wellbeing much more that it would reduce the happiness of those who would pay the extra taxation . ( Since public policy is not to raise taxes , this option for raising the nation 's happiness is not being contemplated . ) <p> The reason I have focused on this quantitative study is not only because it is the only one in the report -- there is plenty of descriptive data -- but because it was able to incorporate two other effects which are less commonly investigated . <p> The first was trust in the health system . Trust it and one is 0.35 points ( say 5 percent ) happier on average . That is not quite as good as being married , but near enough . ( You can have both . ) <p> The second was trust in the government . That scores an extra 0.25 points . <p> What struck me was that in America -- which is in the sample of 22 countries -- there are strong political pressures to distrust the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distrust medical advice . On the standard happiness rankings America is only 19th -- ten places behind New Zealand in the Gallup survey of 149 countries . ( Those above us are Finland , Iceland , Denmark , Switzerland , Netherlands , Sweden , Germany and Norway -- all countries to which we pay little attention when developing public policy . ) We could get down to the US level by doubling the unemployment rate and the divorce rate and then some . <p> The constant redisorganisations of the health system must be reducing our trust in it , for the rhetoric rarely tries to reinforce it . Ironically , at the moment National 's health spokesperson , Shane Reti , expresses more trust in our health system than the Minister of Health , Andrew Little . Perhaps everyone , or their friends , needs a bout in hospital which would enhance their trust in the health system . Certainly that is the feedback I get from those who have engaged with my local one . <p> There is a stream in our public political rhetoric which discourages trust in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the current government , it is a fine balance between providing a critique of it and undermining the New Zealand government in general . To go down the latter path is the way to an unhappier nation . <p> Brian Easton , an independent scholar , is an economist , social statistician , public policy analyst and historian . He was the Listener economic columnist from 1978 to 2014 . This is a re-post of an article originally published on pundit.co.nz .

Our current comment policy is here . <h> 71 Comments <p> It is frustrating to see increasing levels of partisanship developing in NZ along the lines of US rhetoric , hopefully this gets kept to the fringes . <p> It certainly does seem more and more apparent that your happiness is strongly influenced by your relationships with others , about the only upside over the last 2 years is re-assessing priorities and spending more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most people happiness depends having friends and good relationships . How much of that has been destroyed by JA ? <p> Consider the new 24 day isolation rules for contacts ( and contacts of contacts ... ) , which will do wonders for relationships than require 1st person presence . It is a lockdown by another name . A rolling lockdown as well . A lockdown fuelled by it 's own participants . Imagine how many people will be at home , instead of at work or at school . Even supermarkets will not be uneffected by virtue of the number of people who use them and the workers who come into cantact with them . Think of elderly people in retirement villages where a social life depends on their weekly gatherings ? <p> Is it possible you could be just out of one 24 day isolation-lockdown and immediately become a contact of someone else , and have to repeat all over again . Is it possible ? <p> This is what I understand . If I am wrong about anything , please let me know . <p> I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intent . Boomers as people are n't different from many others , most of the problem lies in how they 're a demographic anomaly in terms of size - 3 boomers for every gen z . <p> All the partisan stuff gen xploited keeps hammering is n't conducive to reasoned discussion and considered conclusions . <p> Hmmmmm - We have known about the Limits to Growth for 50 years . It 's not rocket science ; every litre you or I burn , can NEVER be burned by any future anyone . Ever . Worse , we do n't mitigate the burn , leaving that to them , but not leaving them the energy to do it . <p> I suggest that ignorance is no excuse - that applies to Easton too ....... <p> The young have every right to be p-ss-d - our generation dropped the ball . <p> Every generation blames the one before . The hippies thought they were starting a movement , turned out they mostly ended up becoming self interested in the 80s . <p> The young have inherited the best set of circumstances of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past their individual self interests and harness what they have for the benefit of all future humans ? <p> " ... finding the unemployed scored themselves a whopping 1.3 points -- say 20 percent -- lower . Those who ceased to look for jobs and were described as ' inactive ' were only half that . " <p> For tens of thousands of years humans lived in collaborative small settlements or nomadic tribes , and everyone had a role - something they did that contributed to their wellbeing and that of the collective . Roles included childcare , hunting , building , farming , entertaining people with music , or combinations of lots of different things . This gave individuals a sense of purpose . <p> It is only in relatively recent times that we have started to tolerate involuntary unemployment and all of it 's pernicious impacts on our individual and collective wellbeing . Involuntary unemployment is not an unfortunate accident , it is a design feature of modern economies .

Last month Adrian Orr gave a speech in which he basically said that unemployment was too low and we needed more people out of work to prevent inflation . <p> Is economic the only " inhumane " thing ? is the ability to build and fly gigantic airplanes , submarines , bullet trains etc " human " ? we are living in a time that we ( collectively ) , have an insane impact on our environment , we have insane abilities . We are on the journey of becoming something other than what we have been for sure ! when I was a kid ( about 30 years ago ) i was so amazed by Sifi movies where people talked to each other over phone while seeing each other on screens . I thought that surely is impossible . <p> I 've always enjoyed New Zealand for its rural roads , spectacular wild scenery , low population density and gentle climate . Just unfortunate that the human development and a growing population are doing so much damage . Still we absolutely must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ... some reason ? <p> Plenty of Auckland sprawl has been over prime horticultural landscape that is also important to the future of our food security . We 've replaced it with financially and environmentally costly sprawl , roading , and personal car travel . <p> The sprawl has been the result of a set of local policies that favoured expensive single family dwellings on large plots of land . Where in Continental Europe they would favour five or six story building with low cost apartments . <p> There is nothing natural or inevitable about suburban sprawl , it 's a consequence of not doing any actual urban planning . <p> We could have kept horticultural land while allowing people to build what they wanted on their own land further in . Just need to stop authoritarian NIMBYs from denying others the freedom to build on their own land . <p> Rob Adams , City Architect of the City of Melbourne , notes that for every 1 million population you can enable to live around the existing infrastructure routes in Melbourne - instead of expanding at the fringe - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saving of $550 billion in accommodating their projected population increase to 2050 . That is a drain on the wealth of taxpayers too . <p> There is a high cost to sprawl and the authoritarian NIMBYism that prevents intensification . <p> Cities are nothing more than heat engines ; they need inputs and need to output - both energy , and materials . They are a linear ( and therefore temporary ) arrangement . Draw-down applies , as does entropy . <p> Cities have a footprint much , much bigger than themselves , indeed there is only human demand and more than half of all humans are city-domiciled . Who TF do you think eats all that farm produce ? Consumes all that mined material ? Exhudes all that waste ? <p> Sorry , but you are SO far behind the discussion you could be a politician . Or a journalist ....... <p> Mutually exclusive items . Technology can only be applied to efficiencies , and they run up against hard thermodynamic limits . Carrying-capacity is always depleted ( read Catton 's Overshoot , rather than reciting self-justifying mantra - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The last was a joke ; reasoned and rebuttal of Limits to Growth are mutually exclusive . <p> Most technology applies only to efficiencies , yes . But some is Schumpeterian ; it changes or eliminates the material inputs . The thermodynamic limits of solar PV or nuclear fission are n't even with talking about . <p> The older you were , the happier you were .

When I first worked with such surveys , they showed young adults were happier that those in the middle of their lives -- say 40-year-olds . That curvature effect seems to be disappearing . Does that mean our young are increasingly more miserable ? Why ? <p> Intuitively , because we have set up our economic policy in a way that serves to make young people 's wages and savings worth less and older folks ' assets worth more . We 've used housing and education to saddle our younger folk with ever greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . Debt-driven wealth where others pay our cost . <p> It 's served to make building a viable and stable family life that much harder than it used to be too . <p> Added to that , our default response to pollution and climate change has been " Yes , it 's important , but any response should not be allowed to inconvenience me " . <p> There 's a massive amount of creating and achievement going on - including in areas that are practice related ( e.g. see young musicians on YouTube out-achieving earlier generations because of their greater access to learning resources ) . Likewise , chess masters and grand masters at a younger age have been growing in number . <p> The people who own multiple houses are very happy because they have been made uber wealthy for doing nothing . The people who own one house are happy because they have been given a few hundred thousand for doing nothing . The people who were poorest in society have been punished for not being able to afford an asset .

Happiness is easier to achieve when you both own your own house . <p> I ca n't speak for others but my love for my wife grows deeper every day , We did n't rush into marriage , and were firm friends for years beforehand . We complement each other , and whatever skills one lacks the other either possesses or steps up to learn . We continually grow for the sake of the relationship , never settling into a rut . We share burdens and give the best of ourselves for each other every day . When we exchanged our wedding vows , we made sure we meant it . <p> It was n't always like this , of course - having young children is a massive strain on what is a previously selfish relationship between two people .

@@33668236 <h> ' Accelerate easing of travel restrictions ' <p> The International Air Transport Association ( IATA ) urged governments to accelerate relaxation of travel restrictions as COVID-19 continues to evolve from the pandemic to endemic stage . IATA called for : <p> Removing all travel barriers ( including quarantine and testing ) for those fully vaccinated with a WHO-approved vaccine . Enabling quarantine-free travel for non-vaccinated travelers with a negative pre-departure antigen test result . Removing travel bans , and Accelerating the easing of travel restrictions in recognition that travelers pose no greater risk for COVID-19 spread than already exists in the general population . <p> " With the experience of the Omicron variant , there is mounting scientific evidence and opinion opposing the targeting of travelers with restrictions and country bans to control the spread of COVID-19 . The measures have not worked . Today Omicron is present in all parts of the world . That 's why travel , with very few exceptions , does not increase the risk to general populations . The billions spent testing travelers would be far more effective if allocated to vaccine distribution or strengthening health care systems , " said Willie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A recently published study by Oxera and Edge Health i demonstrated the extremely limited impact of travel restrictions on controlling the spread of Omicron . The study found that : <p> If the UK 's extra measures ii with respect to Omicron had been in place from the beginning of November ( prior to the identification of the variant ) , the peak of the Omicron wave would have been delayed by just five days with 3% fewer cases . The absence of any testing measures for travelers would have seen the Omicron wave peak seven days earlier with an overall 8% increase in cases . Now that Omicron is highly prevalent in the UK , if all travel testing requirements were removed there would be no impact on Omicron case numbers or hospitalizations in the UK . <p> " While the study is specific to the UK , it is clear that travel restrictions in any part of the world have had little impact on the spread of COVID-19 , including the Omicron variant . The UK , France and Switzerland have recognized this and are among the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow their lead . Accelerating the removal of travel restrictions will be a major step towards living with the virus , " said Walsh . <p> With respect to travel bans , last week , the WHO Emergency Committee confirmed their recommendation to " Lift or ease international traffic bans as they do not provide added value and continue to contribute to the economic and social stress experienced by States . The failure of travel restrictions introduced after the detection and reporting of Omicron variant to limit international spread of Omicron demonstrates the ineffectiveness of such measures over time . " <p> What happens when COVID-19 is confirmed as endemic ? <p> All indications point to COVID-19 becoming an endemic condition-one that humankind now has the tools ( including vaccination and therapeutics ) to live and travel with , bolstered by growing population immunity . <p> This aligns with the advice from public health experts to shift the policy focus from an individual 's health status towards policies focusing on population-wide protection .

There is one problem-COVID-19 . But there seem to be more unique solutions to managing travel and COVID-19 than there are countries to travel to .

We have two years of experience to guide us on a simplified and coordinated path to normal travel when COVID-19 is endemic . That normality must recognize that travelers , with very few exceptions , will present no greater risk than exists in the general population . And that 's why travelers should not be subject to any greater restrictions than are applied to the general community , " said Walsh . <p> Vaccination Priorities <p> Mutually recognized policies on vaccination will be critical as we approach the endemic phase .

Unduly short validity periods that effectively require air passengers to get regular booster jabs to travel internationally will consume resources that could support primary vaccination in the developing world and booster doses for the most vulnerable . It is reported that the WHO 's Chief Scientist called for booster doses to be used " to protect the most vulnerable , to protect those at highest risk of severe disease and dying .

As the first quarter of the year is key to bookings for the peak-northern summer travel season , it is important to provide certainty to potential travelers as early as possible . Governments have declared intentions to support a travel recovery . Addressing questions on vaccination validity is a key element , " said Walsh . <p> Industry and Governments Finding Solutions Together <p> In October , the Ministerial Declaration of the ICAO High-level Conference on COVID-19 called for " one vision for aviation recovery .

@@33674235 <h> BooksJanuary 27 , 2022 <h> Reading Imagining Decolonisation , the slim book that invites us to dream big <p> Imagining Decolonisation came out two years ago and is still one of the bestselling books in the country -- it topped the charts at Unity Books Wellington last year . Anahera Gildea responds . <p> When we first moved in , the house across the road was being renovated . We met the father-son builders who were on the job from seven every morning until about seven at night , most days a week . We watched as the small 1950s bungalow was stripped down to a shell , its innards gutted , the foundations repiled , new interior walls erected , a second storey constructed , and so on , accompanied by diggers and weatherboards and skill saws and sanders , painters with sunhats on sturdy ladders , and the inaudible babble of the national programme on the radio all day . The father-son were helping each other out and though they called it renovation it was really a total rebuild . The house that arose on the land where the old one used to be bore absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished , they built a deck , a new set of stairs , and had the grounds landscaped -- the hyacinths uprooted and the native flax , phormium Dark Delight , splayed liberally around its collar . An aluminium shed was delivered , and then a second one for around the back . New concrete was poured for their cars to park on , a dispute settled about the boundaries and the rates with the neighbours up the hill , and a strip of " council " land left to demarcate the space between them . <p> On re-reading Imagining Decolonisation , by Bianca Elkington , Moana Jackson , Rebecca Kiddle , Ocean Ripeka Mercier , Mike Ross , Jennie Smeaton , and Amanda Thomas , I was struck again by Jackson 's analogy of two houses that do the same job of providing shelter for people but have each been constructed on different foundations . The pou of the settler-style whare may not have been retrieved from Huiteananui , their kowhaiwhai patterns can be unrecognisable if not illegible , and their kawa does not set the eye of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses of the coloniser have often been theorised as predatory , consumerist , and based on irredeemable beliefs that all things belong to them . <p> The title of this book implies the possibility of an Indigenous utopian future , but does not presuppose a dystopian settler one . There are no suggestions of " privilege " calculators that tax descendents of colonisers who continue to benefit from the unlawful , historical , acquisition of land . There are no expectations for home owners to bequeath their land back to iwi and hapu on their deathbeds , no fantastical narratives of the settler population storming the Beehive in protest over lack of diversity , and there are no assimilationist policies to pepperpot Pakeha into Maori communities across the motu in order to redistribute wealth and re-socialise them . There was none of that kind of imagining . That would be sedition . Instead , the seven contributors have been generous with their own stories , their knowledge , and their goodwill . They have written a collaborative text that takes as common ground an agreed upon history of the process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts to transform our society are laid down as the groundwork for a broad readership to understand the structures of the colonial context in which we live . <p> The word " decolonisation " has been around since the 1930s and , as Ocean Mercier explains , " In the Aotearoa context ... decolonising does not mean the removal or withdrawal of colonial occupiers so much as a fundamental shift in the ideas , knowledges and value sets that underpin the systems which shape our country . " <p> Decolonisation seeks to address and reverse the effects of colonisation , and though it is a slippery concept and unlikely to furnish us with a handy to-do list , the authors do a staggeringly good job at unpacking it for us so that we , the marea , can have a go at the imagining part . <p> One little book to benevolently rule them all ( Photo : Unity Wellington ) <p> Mike Ross 's essay opens the book and invites us to experience the mid-ocean maelstrom that is the Throat of Parata , the chaos and unmanageability of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrought at the time of encounter . But in order to de-construct anything , we must first understand what it is . <p> The reader is then guided through an overview of colonisation that is restrained but does not equivocate . Moana Jackson 's useful analogy of two houses is engaged , each developed according to its own systems and traditions , and the rakau is passed smoothly to Ocean Mercier , who maintains the analogy and invites us to observe ourselves critically as we try to fathom the two structures : their foundations , their norms , their kawa . The juxtaposition of these two houses alone may deliver revelations for some readers but for many of us , the continual process of colonisation and the seeming unfeasibility of being able to resist it , undermine it , decentre it , will still be the takeaway . Audre Lorde 's provocative and much quoted dictum , " the master 's tools will never dismantle the master 's house , " feels crucial to this conversation . <p> Most days I write in my She 'd . This is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) resurrected enough to store things in and keep them mostly dry . It 's 3x2m , has neither glass in the windows nor a functional door but for all intents and purposes , is a shed . There is only one corner that is sufficiently dry for me to sit in and type but the view is lush , the birds are noisy , and there is no wifi . <p> We have been on this street for years now and I have watched as the renovation frenzy has , one by one , overtaken in upgrades , subdivisions , and remodeling . We stumbled into home ownership before the current crisis , before the average house price in Aotearoa was around the $1 million mark , when it still felt possible for first home buyers to save for a deposit and live . In 2018 the Maori home ownership rate was 31% compared to 52% across the population and now with Covid exacerbating almost every economic and power imbalance , it seems the boundaries of our " properties " continue to be clearly demarcated by fence and road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those who are paid to maintain them . <p> It is true , the word decolonisation is problematic . It continues to address colonisation as the central issue , keeps the structures and scaffolding of our asylum in plain view , and therefore is in danger of obscuring our true desire for recovery , rangatiratanga , and as Moana Jackson puts it , " an ethic of restoration " . That is not the only difficulty with the word . In familiar colonising fashion , language that might have once been a productive call to arms , or a snag in the mind of the settler , has been absorbed into the rhetoric of the woke revolution ( which I am undoubtedly part of ) , and risks losing its ability to transform , to create real social change rather than paying passionate lip service . The authors of Imagining Decolonisation do not shy away from these challenges but nor do they belabour the semantics . Each essay addresses the term " decolonisation " and its varied usefulness without getting stuck in lexical bunkers , preferring to keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word itself . <p> Rebecca Kiddle and Amanda Thomas interrogate the identity of Pakeha as descendants of settler-colonisers , as recipients of white privilege , and as co-victims of the effects of colonisation . The discussion of intergenerational trauma was challenging to read and left me musing on the barely perceptible line between keeping the reader on the page and circling fragility . <p> Nevertheless , one of the persistent drivers of the book is that colonisation is here to stay and that any rebuild we engage in , whether it be of our minds or the colonial machinery , should be done in concert with each other . We can not disaggregate life , we are interdependent -- our stories tell us that . Of how " our ancestors crossed Te Moana-nui-a-Kiwa " , how they survived the Throat of Parata , and how we might too . Jackson 's discussion of restoring justice , and values , and balance , goes far beyond decolonisation .

Body condition and weight should be assessed monthly to help track horse health and to note purposeful or unwanted changes . Bodyweight can be tracked using weight tapes , the Healthy Horse mobile device application , or mathematical equations that use various body measurements . <p> Blanketing a horse is necessary . It will reduce the effects of cold or inclement weather when shelter is not available during turnout periods ; temperatures or wind chill drop below 5 ?

Researchers found that in mild winter weather , horses housed outdoors tended to use very little shelter .

Horse hooves are prone to " ice or snowballs " during the winter . These balls of packed ice or snow make it hard for a horse to walk , increase the chance of slipping and falling , and put stress on tendons and joints . Make sure to pick your horse 's hooves daily , especially after heavy snow and consider fitting snow grips . <p> Keep paddocks in working order .

Avoid shavings , hay , and straw as they tend to slide over ice and provide little traction . <p> Martinson says owners who pay attention to these eight areas can provide a safe environment for their horses throughout the cold months .

@@33695231 <p> The island 's delicacies are arguably the best in the world and this trip will prove it , writes Michael Lamb <p> The party buses make it as far as Passage Rock vineyard at the far eastern end of Waiheke . Orapiu Wharf is a few clicks further on , where disappointed self-drive visitors find gates slammed shut to the private Orapiu Lodge and a small jetty with barely anywhere to park . <p> At first blush , with no village , no shops and a deluge of " no access " signs , this is the non-business end of Waiheke . But greed drives many a mortal obsession and my enthusiasm for the sea-salt goodness of Te Matuku oysters has led me here , so I 'm determined to start my own Waiheke Island Oyster Festival at bivalve ground zero . <p> With no village , no shops and a deluge of ' no access ' signs , this is the non-business end of Waiheke Island . Photo / Michael Lamb <p> Before long I 've sourced the phone number of John , the farm manager at Te Matuku Bay , property of the Fenwick family who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fenwick , rebuilt the oyster farm back in the 1990s . <h> Advertisement <p> We soon find ourselves perched on John 's side-by-side farm truck , climbing steep tracks above Te Matuku Bay . ( Matuku , I later learn , is the Maori name for the Australasian bittern , a critically endangered heron-like coastal bird , of which there are less than 1000 left . ) <p> The scale of the oyster farm unfolds , rows and rows of the growing frames , idling in the cooling blue waters of the bay . And this place , producer of arguably the best oysters in New Zealand ( after those Bluffies ) , is no ordinary place . It is , remarkably , the only oyster farm in the world in a marine reserve . In that spirit , the Fenwicks are heroic guardians here , dedicated to the ecological restoration of land and sea , with their land now covenanted to stay protected from development forever . <p> Rows and rows of the oyster growing frames , idling in the cooling blue waters of the bay . Photo / @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself is n't open to visitors , the Fenwicks understand that access to the public is an important part of keeping the project alive , so they 've created a short hiking track for anyone to traverse , called the Te Matuku Walk ( about 1.5 hours each way , and forms part of the full Te Ara Hura Waiheke Walk , a sturdy 100km itinerary ) . <p> Back on the side-by-side , John guns the engine and takes us up to Jennie Fenwick 's house , where we linger admiring the vast Gulf views , cutting a wide arc from the Clevedon coast all the way back to the city . <p> With an intensive stoat and rat trapping operation in full flow , the wildlife here is returning . John says they now have good numbers of pateke ( brown teal ) , banded rails , dotterel and kaka . The sea is bringing back her wealth too : a secret spot on the farm is brimming with rare longfin eels and kokopu ( giant whitebait ) . <p> As a visitor , you can get close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Circular Bay on the other side of the headland - or try the new budget " Cabin in the valley " vineyard stay . From those locales , explore the 690-hectare Te Matuku Marine Reserve by kayak , taking in views of the oyster farm . Or go bird-spotting , swimming , diving , snorkelling . <p> It turns out this end of Waiheke is n't just for tourists who 've bought their cars over - you can catch the ferry direct to Orapiu from downtown Auckland . For day access , walking the track from Orapiu to Pearl Bay is another great way to get to the marine reserve on foot . Or bring a bike ( or e-bike ) and all manner of possibilities open up : the sculpture park around the corner at Connells Bay and Poderi Crisci winery and restaurant at Awaawaroa . <p> There 's rich history here too : Orapiu was the main settlement for Ma ? ori and Pakeha back in the day .

As the site of Waiheke 's earliest European settlement , there are remnants to check out , like the first school and the pioneer cemetery . <h> Advertisement <p> We seek out the cemetery , nestled just off the main Orapiu road . Under the gorgeous dappled light , filtering through the tall trees , rest the early European residents of this area . It 's atmospheric and beautiful , and you ca n't help but wonder what life was like for these people way back when this end of Waiheke was considered the gateway to the island . <p> Waiheke Island 's Settlers Cemetery is nestled just off the main Orapiu road . Photo / Michael Lamb <p> We 'd love to linger but the oyster trail has only just begun , and we have shellfish to pursue .

No , the man himself is masked up and happily shucking Te Matuku oysters . <p> We order up a dozen , which arrive on a bed of chipped ice , and we scoff them like hungry convicts , taking in the dreamy evening views out over Oneroa Bay . The Oyster Inn is a mandatory stop on any oyster-based Waiheke itinerary . The service is excellent and the oysters are perfection , served with a simple yet on point chardonnay vinegar-based vinaigrette . Oh , and insist on a balcony table . <p> Next day , we continue the oyster quest with a lunch at the Spanish-inspired Casita Miro ( or " Miro 's Small House " ) , high above Onetangi . <p> Here you can order your oysters in singles , served with finely diced shallots and wondrous Ximenez Spinola sherry vinegar . Bliss . <p> Island Chef Anthony McNamara , who runs catered events , is another true believer : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are some of the finest in the world and it is because of the terroir of the water they 're grown in . " <p> Now , if you just want a big old oyster feasting session at your Waiheke accomm , without all the restaurant fuss , head to the Te Matuku Seafood Market in Ostend , where the oysters are available unshucked , on the half shell , as oyster meat and even frozen . Top tip : if you want ' em fresh , get in early ( before 11am ) or the day 's supply might be sold out . <p> We plan to hit Ki Maha restaurant on the beach at Onetangi , which temptingly offers the local oysters freshly shucked accompanied by a champagne mignonette , or battered with a watercress mayonnaise ... but our time has run out and our wallets are empty . <p> Oneroa and Onetangi , Palm Beach and Ostend , and of course all the scattered wineries : these are the big-ticket drawcards for a Waiheke stay .

This indicates that the pandemic has made daters rethink what they 're really looking for , with singletons now exploring new horizons and considering potential matches that previously would 've been swiped left . <p> " The trends we 've identified show how the pandemic and 18-months of lockdowns have made daters significantly reassess what they want and how they feel about themselves , " McCart tells Newshub . <p> " The experiences of the last two years have afforded us a lot of time and space to reflect on past relationships and what we desire in new relationships . With this in mind , a lot of single people are recognising the fact that if they want to achieve different results romantically - whether that be finding a serious partner or simply having better dates - they probably need to try something new .

Photo credit : Getty Images <h> Fast-forwarding <p> In 2022 , daters will be looking for new sets of qualities in their potential partner . The pandemic has defined the last two years and many people feel differently to how they did at the start , McCart says , with almost a third of Bumble users ( 29 percent ) saying the pandemic has drastically changed what they are looking for in a partner . <p> According to the research , three in five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quarter ( 24 percent ) said they now care less about a partners ' physical appearance compared to the beginning of the pandemic . <p> " A third of Bumble users say the pandemic has drastically changed what they are looking for in a partner , so heading into 2022 , we are going to see a shift in the way people approach dating , " McCart says . <p> " Moving forward , it 's important to acknowledge that we 've all changed since the start of the pandemic . Many of us feel different to how we did at the start , and our priorities have shifted . <p> " The last two years have given us time to really sit with our own thoughts and reflect on what we 're looking for in a partner . What we may have settled for in the past is no longer going to cut it , so singles are feeling empowered to throw out the rule book and date in a way that works for them . " <h> Consciously single <p> The term " conscious uncoupling " has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paltrow and Chris Martin split in 2014 - in a nutshell , the decision to amicably separate while consciously resolving difficult feelings in order to fully end a chapter in one 's life . But McCart says 2022 is the year of being ' consciously single ' - in other words , not settling for anyone less than the elusive ' One ' . <p> Despite the research indicating that almost half of the Kiwis on Bumble are now looking for a relationship , the study also found the pandemic has made 47 percent of users understand that it 's perfectly okay to be alone for a while . People are now consciously making the decision to stay single , with many attempting to be more mindful and intentional in how and when they date . <p> " Throughout the pandemic , we have seen the rise of slow-dating where people are drawing out the courting process and taking more time to get to know each other , indicating that they are looking for more meaningful relationships rather than being desperate to settle . This in turn reduces the stress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in control of your dating journey . It 's about looking for the right person , not just any person , " McCart explains . <p> " On the flipside , there are those who are choosing to be single post-pandemic , knowing that finding a partner is n't their top priority right now . People with this mindset are content in their single life for the time being and choose to be more intentional about how they date in the future . Words like ' mindfulness ' and ' intentional ' have also been a big part of the pop culture lexicon in the last few years , so it is not surprising that this is coming through in dating trends as well . <p> " However , deciding that it 's okay to be alone does n't mean totally hitting the brakes on your dating life . It 's about being content in your single life and knowing that finding a partner does n't have to be your number one priority . Having that insight and control makes dating a more fun and empowering experience when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Power PDA <p> Bumble also predicts that 2022 will be the Year of Public Displays of Affection ( PDA ) . With vaccination rates increasing , restrictions easing and a sense of newfound freedom , PDA will be back in a big way , McCart says , with more than two in three Bumble users ( 65 percent ) saying they are more open to public displays of affection post-pandemic . <p> " Singles are excited to jump back into in-real-life dates and are feeling more comfortable with public displays of affection , " McCart says . <p> Not only are we vaxxed , waxed and ready for sax ( I 'm sorry , I had to ) , dating trends also tend to reflect the latest developments in pop culture - and boy , oh boy , have popular power couples been packing on the PDA ( ? la Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker or Machine Gun Kelly and Megan Fox ) . <p> Celebrities and their significant others have popularised the celebration of sexuality on social media , where both partners are proud of their sexual connection and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more conservative social norms of yesteryear , where acts of affection were reserved for the privacy of your own home - and will undoubtedly influence mere mortals and their approach to dating , McCart says . <p> " Dating trends reflect social trends back at us - so if we are seeing the rise of power couple PDA on social media and hearing terms like ' conscious uncoupling ' , this will trickle down and is going to be reflected in how we approach our dating life , which is ultimately part of our social life , " McCart explains . <p> " That said , I believe that all of these trends have the potential to have a positive impact on how we date , with more of an emphasis on being open-minded and trying new things .

This increase ensures that Minimum Wage workers do fall further behind other workers and means that their incomes are protected in real terms , said CTU President Richard Wagstaff . <p> " For a full time Minimum Wage worker this means an extra $48 a week in income , or $2,496 annually .

Unemployment is at record low levels . Employers primary concern in surveys is their inability to access labour . There has never been a better time to increase the minimum wage .

But their legacy for those caught up in them remains <h> For the first time in almost two years -- 704 days -- Australia 's borders will open to all fully-vaccinated travellers next week . But for many the ordeal is far from over . <p> 20 February 2022 <p> For the first time in almost two years -- 704 days -- Australia 's borders will reopen to all fully-vaccinated travellers tomorrow . But for many the ordeal is far from over . <p> When Prime Minister Scott Morrison stood in front of the nation , flanked by two Australian flags , and announced a complete travel ban on non-citizens and residents entering the country the following day , many knew exactly what was coming . <p> A day earlier , Morrison had announced a worldwide " do not travel " warning for Australians as COVID-19 cases multiplied . Days later , this was strengthened to a " ban " on Australians travelling overseas without an exemption . <p> It was the first time in history Australians had been barred from leaving the country . <p> A map @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the situation home . <p> At the time , in March 2020 , Morrison justified the travel ban on the basis that 80 per cent of coronavirus cases detected in Australia stemmed from overseas transmission . <p> " We are looking at a situation of at least six months for how we deal with this . It could be much longer than that . It could be shorter , " Morrison said as he warned Australians against leaving the country . <p> Much has changed : babies have been born , had birthdays , and started walking , without their grandparents , or even parents , there with them . People have died , without family by their side . Couples have lived and cried apart , brought together only by screens , and many others have been forced to make drastic life changes due to policies outside their control . <p> While the travel ban helped keep Australia free from the pandemic-induced calamity elsewhere in the world , at least for a while , they also attracted sharp criticism -- not least of all from thousands of Australian citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their country of birth due to travel caps and unreliable flights . <p> Many citizens have now come home and more have reunited with their families overseas . Others are waiting for the final restrictions to lift on Monday , and some still do n't know when their circumstances will allow them to return . <p> For West Australians , the uncertainty has lasted even longer . After years cut off from the rest of the country , on Friday Premier Mark McGowan announced the state 's hard borders would lift on March 3 -- a week and a half after the rest of the country . <p> But as Australia 's " hermit kingdom " chapter closes , the pain of the past two years is still very fresh . There are many thousands of stories of people impacted by the travel ban -- here are five of them . <h> Those still stuck overseas <p> Childcare worker Visha Sunyasi is among those still waiting to come home . <p> For the past two years , her home in Western Australia , full of belongings , has sat untouched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced forced an unexpected trip to Mauritius . <p> When the news of the travel ban spread , Visha , her husband and her son , immediately tried to return to Australia -- but because they were not citizens or permanent residents , it was too late . <p> " We were only supposed to come for a week , " the 36-year-old , who had lived in Australia for five years , says . <p> " We came with nothing , everything is over there . We did n't even bring our clothes . " <p> Visha says her new , unexpected , life in Mauritius has been difficult . She 's had to find foster carers for her dog , who she left in Australia . Her 11-year-old son only speaks English and ca n't attend public school because he does n't have a Mauritian birth certificate . <p> Instead , the family has been forced to pay for expensive private school so he does n't fall behind . When he left Australia , he was in year 4 -- he 's now starting high school . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he still has n't been able to learn the language here properly , " she says . <p> For her , finding work has also been impossible with all her qualifications and diplomas in a box in Australia . <p> " We came with nothing , we 've had to start from zero here , " she says . <p> " It kills me , I ca n't be there for my dog , I ca n't use my own computer , I ca n't have my stuff , our life is still there . " <p> Visha 's bridging visa expired months after becoming stranded , adding another hurdle to returning . She 's since applied for a skilled work visa , which allows invited applicants to live in Australia for five years . <p> " It 's been two years now and they have n't even processed it , " she says . McGowan 's shock announcement on Friday offers some hope however , opening up the possibility the family can soon return home as tourists . <h> Those who could n't leave <p> Over in Australia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country that stays with Sydney resident Harry Karandikar . <p> In May last year , as Delta tore across India , the 38-year-old risk consultant got a call he had been dreading : both his parents in New Dehli had tested positive for the virus . <p> People around the world had watched terrifying scenes playing out on Indian streets ; hospitals were over-stuffed and turning people away and family members were barred from attending the cremation of their loved ones . <p> As a result , the Australian government pushed its travel ban for India even further : for the first time , citizens and permanent residents were temporarily threatened with jail time and heavy fines if they tried to return to Australia . Likewise , Australian civilians were unable to get an exemption to travel to India . <p> Over three weeks , as his father 's condition deteriorated , Harry -- who is an Australian citizen and has lived here for 20 years -- kept applying for exemptions to leave the country so he could see him . Each time , he was knocked back . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you continue to sink money into something when you know the returns are highly stacked against you but you still do it , " he says . <p> " Except , in this case , I was gambling my emotions instead of cash . " <p> When flights resumed , it was too late : his father , due to a combination of a blood clot and COVID-19 infection , died on June 13 . The funeral happened without Harry the next day . He had n't seen his father in two years . <p> " Video calls over WhatsApp are not the same thing , " he says . <p> An only child , he was then desperate to be with his mother ( who was also rejected from coming to Australia ) . <p> " She was in her 60s , managing a lot of things alone , and needed to see her only child , " he says . " Even that was knocked back . " <p> Now , more than half a year later , Harry 's mother is planning to travel to Sydney in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they will hold a small ceremony to mark his life -- this time , together . <p> " The past two years are going to remain with us for the rest of our lives , " he says . " As a group of people , with connections across multiple continents and countries , we feel that we 've been let down by the system . " <h> The new mum left to go it alone <p> Nurse Rheanon Ronquillo is similarly still working to unpack the trauma of being separated from her partner during her pregnancy and first year as a new mum . <p> In November last year , Rheanon 's husband met their daughter for the first time in the Philippines -- a year and a half after she was born in Mildura , in regional Victoria -- when permanent residents were once again allowed to travel overseas . <p> The family is overjoyed to be together and will finally arrive in Australia together this week , but the road to this moment did n't come easily . <p> Rheanon , a permanent resident , discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in late 2019 . <p> When months later the borders closed , panic set in : " I was crying , thinking ' I will be alone in the delivery room , it will just be me ' . " <p> When her colleagues threw her a gender reveal party at work back in Australia , Rheanon 's then-fiance was forced to watch through a video screen . <p> But the real challenges began after the birth . A first-time mum in a foreign land , without family nearby for support , Rheanon relied on friends and the local Filipino community to juggle looking after her daughter and continuing her work on the pandemic frontlines . For extra support , she moved in with a friend 's family . <p> " I was just crying every night , but I did n't want to show my colleagues and friends . You try to show them that you are ok , " she says . <p> " But deep in myself , I knew it was n't going to be OK , asking myself : ' How will I take care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take care of a baby . It 's my first time ' . <p> " The baby 's growing , it 's not slowing down . One day she was really small , and then you blink , and she 's walking and running . It 's really sad when you 've been witnessing these milestones alone when your husband is on the other side of the world . " <p> It was with this mindset , in November , that she made the decision to go back to the Philippines for three months . " Our daughter did n't want to go to her dad at first , it was like warming up : ' who 's this guy that looks like me ' , " she says . " Now she 's got the hang of it ... they 're inseparable . " <p> Once they 're settled in Australia , the couple plan to start the process of applying for a partner visa that will allow her husband to stay permanently . <p> But even now , Rheanon does n't feel completely secure . " The rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " I just hope they do n't lock the borders anymore . Whatever happened to me , I do n't want it to happen to my worst enemy . " <h> The couple who took a leap of faith <p> Courtney Courier and Cameron McDougall credit the pandemic as the reason they met -- but it 's also forced them to take extreme action to stay together . <p> In early 2021 , both working from home -- Courtney , 28 , in Portland in the United States and Cameron , 33 , in Hamilton near Brisbane -- they turned to a new social media platform called Clubhouse to meet new people and stay connected to the outside world . <p> Quips in group chats quickly became long , one-on-one conversations that would continue late into the evening . Soon they were " on FaceTime 24/7 " . <p> " We 'd be falling asleep on it , I 'd be waking up to it , I 'd set my kitchen on fire and she 'd tell me before I knew about it , " Cameron says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I realised I could n't live like this . " <p> But in the middle of a pandemic , being together physically was n't going to be easy . Ideally , Courtney wanted to relocate to Australia because of Cameron 's career -- but the travel ban meant that was n't possible . <p> Instead , they decided to take a " leap of faith " : In October , Cameron quit his job at an electric vehicle start-up , sold his belongings , and applied for a six month US visa . The final step was providing their call logs and entire WhatsApp history as evidence to support Cameron 's exemption to travel . <p> " It 's COVID , we did n't know where the world was going , and the most important thing was to figure out a way to be together , " Courtney says . " During this time , if you 're going to be in a relationship that crosses borders , you have to make sure you 're committed to this . " <p> Now , with Cameron 's visa coming to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple are facing the prospect of packing up and doing it all over again . <p> The hope is Courtney will now be able to travel to Australia as a tourist and transition to a partner visa , but there 's still the fear that backed up visa processing times could mean another separation . <p> " Essentially , it could be upwards of two years until either of us get any sort of legal right to work in either country , " Cameron says . " It 's going to be a long , long battle . " <p> " The main thing we do n't want is to be apart for any length of time , " he continues . " Because with COVID , there could be a new strain or variant and they could lock borders -- we 're at the point where we are going to do our absolute best not to be separated . " <h> Those who want to make every year count <p> Like many Australians , Valerie Preston is eager to get back into the world . <p> Not only is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New Zealand , who she has n't seen in more than two years , she 's also keen to make the most of what she calls " the pointy end " of her life . <p> This involves a long bucket list , from long-distance walks in South America , to a trip to the Galapagos Islands and a tour around Iceland . But at 69 years old , she 's realistic . " The years to do these things are running out . Every year really counts in what 's available , my capacity , and whether I could actually manage to do these things , " she says . <p> " I know people who are in their mid and late 70s who are fit and able , but there 's no guarantee that I 'll be right up there with them . " <p> From her home in Picton , just outside Perth , she 'll watch tourists arrive on Monday . Until Friday , she had no idea when she would be able to do the same . <p> Western Australia was originally scheduled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Omicron wave prompted McGowan to delay the decision by almost a month . <p> Valerie is conflicted when she reflects on Western Australia 's approach to borders during the pandemic : on one hand , she recognises that the strict rules allowed her life to continue in relative safety while the pandemic raged elsewhere . <p> Because of her age , she also does n't know " how she would fare " if she was to catch COVID-19 , even with her relatively good health . " I 'm a reasonably fit person , but sometimes that 's not a guarantee , " she says . Travelling overseas , she acknowledges , will come with a degree of risk . <p> But on the other hand , she adds : " Every day your life is getting shorter ... I just hope I 'm up for it . "

@@33803230 <p> ACT Party leader David Seymour is defending himself after facing criticism for meeting with anti-mandate protesters in Wellington . <p> Seymour said he decided to meet with the protesters after Alistair Boyce , the owner of the Backbencher pub asked him to . Boyce was forced to close his pub near Parliament due to protesters hurling abuse at his staff last week . But Seymour said Boyce now believed the more " odious " protesters have left and he wanted to meet with them to ensure he could reopen without issue . <p> Seymour , who was joined by ACT MP Nicole McKee , said the conditions he delivered to the protesters included removing vehicles blocking the roads around Parliament and Victoria University , and a guarantee that no more people passing by would be harassed . <p> Speaking with AM on Thursday , Seymour said he met with the protesters to help a small business owner . <p> " I was asked by somebody who runs a business in the area who has been terribly affected , not just in the last week but actually by two years , and what I said to these folks was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the streets because you ca n't complain about restrictions when you 're stopping businesses from operating , same thing goes for Victoria University , you 've got to ensure that those more odious elements are not part of the protest because no one can support threats and so on , you ca n't be talking about civil liberties while you 're making threats of violence ' . <p> " Then having dealt with that I think it 's time for dialogue because these people are human , they are part of New Zealand and at the end of this we need to glue this country back together , " Seymour told AM . <p> The ACT leader also hit out at the Government 's handling of the protesters , slamming Speaker of the House Trevor Mallard 's response . <p> " Some people say you should n't have any kind of contact .

Some people there , I believe , are actually protesting against the Government 's response to the protest . " <p> Seymour said the protest is a " concentrated form of the frustrations " many Kiwis have over the Government 's COVID-19 response . <p> " I think it would be fair to say that it 's possible to disagree with the nature of the protest , and especially some of the incidents that occurred earlier on . But the wider question is when does New Zealand get its way of life and its freedoms back and that is something that I think a lot of people would like an answer to . <p> " The protest is just the more concentrated form of the frustrations people have with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in that sense , I think a lot of people have some sympathy . " <p> Seymour 's response is world 's apart from Ardern who has so far refused to engage with the protesters . <p> On Wednesday the Prime Minister criticised the ACT Leader 's meeting . <p> " I do n't think it was a responsible thing to do for a party that purports to be the champion of law and order or indeed businesses , to meet with those who are obstructing Wellingtonians from going about their everyday lives , bullying and harassing people who are trying to go to school or work , " she told reporters on Wednesday . <p> " I do think meeting with them was irresponsible .

@@33852233 <h> Pines a ' fundamental mistake ' <p> If ever there was doubt New Zealand had gone up a blind climate alley by moving towards large plantings of pine trees , the latest international scientists ' report has firmly laid that to rest . <p> It is now beyond doubt that New Zealand 's primary strategy for tackling climate change -- offsetting through the Emissions Trading Scheme , with the financial incentives it gives to the large-scale planting of monocultures of exotic pine trees -- runs in the opposite direction to international scientific advice . <p> In the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) report , for instance , released last week , the practice of " planting large-scale non-native monocultures , which would lead to loss of biodiversity and poor climate change resilience " was placed among the Worst Practices and Negative Adaptation Trade-offs for temperate forests . <p> By way of contrast , to " maintain or restore natural species and structural diversity , leading to more diverse and resilient systems " was placed among the Best Practices and Adaptation Benefits , with very high impacts . <p> Last year in the report Biodiversity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Royal Society ( UK ) also advised against establishing large monoculture tree plantations as long-term carbon sinks . <p> " Policy measures to discourage : Planting trees , either for bioenergy or as long-term carbon sinks , should focus on restoring and expanding native woodlands and avoid creating large monoculture plantations that do not support high levels of biodiversity . <p> " Simple targets such as ' numbers of trees planted ' ignore biodiversity considerations , such as long-term survival of trees or stewardship , and can be misleading , potentially contributing to policy failure and misuse of carbon offsets . " <p> Likewise , the report from the joint workshop COP Panels on Biodiversity and Climate Change 2021 recommended discouraging ecosystem-based approaches to climate mitigation that have negative outcomes for biodiversity , such as tree planting in inappropriate ecosystems , and monocultures , for the following reasons : <p> ? Large-scale tree planting can be harmful to biodiversity and food production due to competition for land . <p> ? Afforestation may reduce existing ecosystem carbon storage , cause further biodiversity loss and displace people or curtail their access to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> ? Plantations of exotic species often have negative impacts on biodiversity , on adaptive capacity and on many of nature 's contributions to people not related to timber production or carbon sequestration , especially if the planted species becomes invasive . <p> Further , their climate benefits may be offset by local warming , especially in boreal and temperate regions , which is induced by exchanges of water and energy compared with the land cover which it replaces . <p> The concept of " offsets " using natural climate solutions has been proposed to achieve early emissions reductions ( particularly at lower cost ) or to compensate for continued emissions from hard-to-decarbonise sectors . Such offsets are increasingly part of net-zero emissions pledges . <p> However , the use of carbon offsets has come under increasing scrutiny because of the challenges of additionality , problems with overstated emissions reductions and double counting , difficulty in monitoring and verification , and the unclear permanence of such actions , as well as potential social equity impacts of actions like large-scale tree planting . <p> These reports are based on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It is frustrating to watch our country trying to tackle climate change with a strategy that is overwhelmingly condemned by the global scientific community . <p> We would n't dream of doing this with the Covid-19 pandemic , yet climate change is even more dangerous , as another UN report , Extraordinary Landscape Fire , released recently , spells out . <p> Silo thinking , vested interests in forestry and carbon farming , a focus on short-term profit , " green-washing " , and a failure to think about the complex interactions between ecosystems , communities , prosperity and wellbeing have led New Zealand up a blind alley in tackling climate change . <p> The uncontrolled conversion of sheep and beef farmland to monoculture plantations is happening at pace , exemplifying Worst Practices and Negative Adaptation Trade-offs , according to the IPCC . <p> As temperatures rise , bringing droughts and the risk of wildfires , conifer plantations make this effect worse through the absorption of solar radiation ( the albedo effect ) and impacts on the water cycle . <p> As the IPCC observes , " projected increases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind places forests at risk , and affects their ongoing role in meeting New Zealand 's emissions reduction goals " . <p> The risk is that all the carbon gains made will be lost at a stroke and become debts instead . <p> While David Parker , Minister for the Environment , has announced a law change to reinstate the national interest test for international investors in forestry under the Overseas Investment Act , this is just a first , tentative step . Other steps , including reserving the incoming Permanent Forest category in the Emissions Trading Scheme for native forests , and requiring Forest Environment Plans in parallel with Farm Environment Plans , are urgently needed . <p> Above all , New Zealanders -- politicians , officials , investors and Kiwis at large -- need to be aware that global scientific advice recommends strongly against New Zealand 's primary strategy for tackling climate change -- large-scale industrial tree plantations , both at home and abroad . <p> New Zealand 's overwhelming reliance on offsetting by planting large swathes of pine trees across its landscapes is itself blind to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake .

A set play from the back of the scrum in Chiefs territory saw the Crusaders work the blindside and kick into space ; the bounce getting the better of Chiefs No 8 Pita Gus Sowakula , and sitting up for David Havili to plant over the line . <p> There were several almost-tries , but strong defensive efforts stifled them -- most notably when Sowakula knocked the ball from Ethan Blackadder 's grasp as he was about to dot down .

With plenty of time in possession , the visitors went at their hosts -- and they kept coming . <p> But the Crusaders kept tackling . The hosts were smart in their defence -- not rushing or overcommitting defenders to the tackle , keeping their line tight and counter-rucking with plenty of success . <p> After plugging away seemingly all half , the Chiefs finally broke through in the with a spectacular diving finish . Bryn Gatland 's ensuing conversion closed the gap to four points . <p> While the Crusaders had been immense defensively , the fact they had to make over 200 tackles to the Chiefs ' sub-100 began to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> After penalties allowed the Chiefs deep into the Crusaders half at the death , it was set up for someone to be a hero .

" <p> Those quotes probably did n't make the Nats ' highlight reel ( not that there was one ; leader and tech session convenor Judith Collins was dumped the next day ) . <p> But the Rocket Lab founder also made a broader point about parochialism . <p> " Fundamentally as Kiwis , we are good at tech . But we also have to acknowledge that we 're a small country , and we need to bring the best here as well , " Beck said . <p> " We need to create environments where people can think and go big .

As a nation , we need to get comfortable with our deep-tech thinking global from day one , which may involve going offshore .

And it would n't surprise me if Avertana , Dotterel and Mint all the other children of LanzaTech on to global success . Or , once they reach a certain point in size , they get bought by Americans or leave our shores . <p> Is that our place in the world , to be a perpetual business incubator for the Nasdaq ( or , with the $65m in subsidies to Hawaiki Cable , Singapore investors ) ? <h> When we grant taxpayer money , what defines success ? <p> The intensive industrial scale of LanzaTech meant it was always going to have to base most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expand your logistical operations in NZ at the same time you invade the US , and that it 's possible to keep a lot of management and R&amp;D local . <p> Could or should others do the same ? Part of the problem is that it 's just being discussed by our policymakers . <p> Various Government agencies have pointed to money being recycled into the local ecosystems by offshore sales , but one of the key recyclers - Sam Morgan - has said quality startups will always find private funding or a buyer . He is against the Crown trying to pick winners with any type of subsidy . <p> " What are the Government 's objectives around its funding programmes to support early-stage companies and innovation ? " , Shale asks . <p> " What is defined as success ? " <p> There is half an answer . The Government wants to help create more high-paying jobs that suit a modern economy , and generate more R&amp;D here . But what happens next , when Silicon Valley comes knocking ?

" Suddenly , everything was available . In the same store you could buy an affordable bookshelf , a rug , a mattress .

But in return , he offered a sharp rise in living standards , including the ability to pursue a western form of consumerism . <p> Ikea 's iconic status among part of the middle class was boosted when it launched a public campaign against corruption in Russian life . In 2009 , it announced that it was halting new investment in the country because of the pervasive bribes that it was asked to pay . <p> The company began to buy its own generators so that officials would not be able to threaten power cuts if bribes went unpaid . A year later the company sacked two senior executives -- one of whom was close to founder Ingvar Kamprad -- who had allegedly turned a blind eye to bribes being paid to secure power for a store in St Petersburg . <p> However , over the past decade Putin 's legitimacy has rested much less on rising living standards , as the economy has stagnated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the west . In the process , the political and cultural importance of western consumer goods has diminished . The annexation of Crimea in 2014 , which led to a round of sanctions on Russia 's economy , was popular with many Russians . <p> Not only has some of the novelty value worn off , but there are plenty of Russian brands that can now compete with multinationals , offering similar products or experiences . <p> With 847 restaurants , McDonald 's was the leading fast-food chain before it announced its own suspension of operations , but it faces homegrown challengers such as Dodo Pizza , and Teremok , an ultra-cheap chain offering Russian-style pancakes . Several Chinese fast-food brands have become popular in recent years . Ikea also now has domestic rivals such as Hoff . <p> The initial response of the regime has been to try and mobilise a nationalist backlash against the foreign brands .

" <p> Speaking on Thursday , Moscow 's mayor Sergei Sobyanin said the government would provide Rbs500 million ( $5.8m ) for preferential credits of Russian fast-food chains to help " to fill the niche which is being vacated by foreign chains " . McDonald 's network could be replaced by domestic businesses within the space of six months to a year , he said , " especially since the foodstuffs themselves are supplied by Russian suppliers " . <p> Filippov , the sociologist , says the closures could rally people behind the government .

The Institute of International Finance is predicting a 15 per cent slump in the Russian economy this year , taking real gross domestic product back to the levels of the early 2000s , just after Ikea first opened in the country . <p> Shapovaliants says she fears for the future of her counselling and training business , which she began eight years ago .

@@34071231 <h> Paul Catmur <p> Most business books are not very useful . They are written to build the ego of the author rather than the business of the reader . <p> They like to assume that the reader is a talented , charismatic , individual who has a dream of changing the world , no doubt because that 's how the authors see themselves .

Knight is shy , introverted and insecure , a sort of indie band entrepreneur who did n't set out to get rich or change the world , he just wanted to build a shoe company . <p> Knight 's book is a favourite of both Bill Gates and Warren Buffet and worth a read if you 've missed it .

Maybe I should get one of them . <h> It 's all a game <p> After a dogged , but unspectacular time as a college athlete , Knight dumped accountancy and decided to follow his dream to run his own shoe company . He treated running a business like he would running a 1600-metre race , more important than the talent was the absolute refusal to lose . <h> Advertisement <p> Knight was n't brilliant at anything , but he had an utter obsession with creating the best company he could and was incredibly successful at finding others who shared that obsession . Life 's a game , play to win . <h> Logo ? Name your price <p> The freelance designer who came up with the Nike " swoosh " , one of the most famous logos in the world , was paid $35 .

It does n't matter whether or not the rationale is actually rational , just as long as there is one . Research also adds to the cost , though researching a design with consumers is about as informative as asking a dog what colour bowl it would like its biscuits in . <h> What 's in a name ? <p> People now think that " Nike " is an inspired name , but Knight did n't even like it . " What else you got ? " was the initial reaction . " Nike " was a default chosen at the last minute because Knight 's underlings all hated his favourite name , " Dimension Six " . <p> The suitability of a product name can only really be determined in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product to which it 's attached . <p> Nike co-founder and former chief executive Phil Knight , pictured in 1995 , standing next to a pair of sneakers on display in a gallery .

In a technical context , it conjures up visions of high-tech with a human face and incredibly intuitive software . It 's not the name , it 's the product that counts . <p> Consider the initials : IBM , FBI , BMW , CIA , Nato . They are all capable of triggering distinctive mental images despite being seemingly random groups of letters .

As a business , we have made some key acquisitions over the last few years that have left us better prepared to service our partners . <p> From this perspective , the main focus in 2022 will be to make sure we are on the right path , and making key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolution of the business . <p> Juniper has always been committed to building partnerships and long-lasting relationships that will ensure growth for both the company and our channel partners . In doing so , we will continue to ensure that our partners are well equipped with the right skills , specialisation and accreditation to help us get the best solutions into the hands of our end customers . <p> We also want to continue investing in the development and wellbeing of our people . Particularly given the last two years , we want to continue making sure employees are healthy , happy and feel well . We recently launched the Juniper Unplugged Program , a global program focused on spending time in the community and assisting those in need . <p> Ensuring we build on these initiatives will be a strong focus of mine , as I know the positive impact they can have on our employees ' wellbeing at both a personal and professional level . <p> What has been your biggest business mistake , and the lessons you 've learnt from that experience ? <p> While there has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the times I did n't trust my gut feeling are the times I came unstuck . Ultimately , these mistakes gave me the ability to have different perspectives -- something which is particularly important when operating at a regional level . <p> In my current APAC-wide role , I 've especially realised how valuable it is to have a diversity of thought processes among the team as it allows you to minimise the chances of making a rash decision , which leads to better business outcomes . <p> What are some of your ambitions -- personally and professionally ? <p> From a professional point of view , my ambition has always been to continue to learn and challenge myself , as without it you become stagnant . When I moved from Australia into an APAC role , I had to spend a lot of time learning how to replicate my work across a broader scope with so many different cultures in the region -- which is something I 've loved doing . <p> Whenever possible , I always look for new opportunities to push myself within the business , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- perhaps working across a different region or taking on a global role . I have also found I work much better in organisations that are growing or need to evolve , as I find the challenge that comes with growth is truly exciting and makes for interesting and engaging work . <p> These are thoughts I apply to my personal life as well . Covid has taught us life is important and should n't be taken for granted , so I 've taken every opportunity to explore new things inside of Singapore during Covid restrictions that I would not have normally done . I 've especially missed travel with friends and family and ca n't wait to get the chance to do it again . <p> What has been the best piece of advice you 've ever received ? <p> I have been given lots of advice over time and ca n't pick one , but my thirteen-year-old gave me a quote not too long that I find myself thinking about quite often : " If you ca n't say it simply then you do n't know it well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your life . <p> The other broader piece of advice I received a long time ago was to be honest and upfront , two qualities that have defined my leadership style over the years and have benefited me both personally and professionally . <h> Featured <h> Slideshows <p> ?

@@34075234 <p> It 's been years since developers found that Nvidia 's main product , the GPU , was useful not just for rendering video games but also for high-performance computing of the kind used in 3D modelling , weather forecasting , or the training of AI models -- and it 's on enterprise applications such as those that CEO Jensen Huang will focus his attention at the company 's GTC 2022 conference . <p> Nvidia is hoping to make it easier for CIOs building digital twins and machine learning models to secure enterprise computing , and even to speed the adoption of quantum computing with a range of new hardware and software . <p> Seeing double <p> Digital twins , numerical models that reflect changes in real-world objects useful in design , manufacturing , and service creation , vary in their level of detail . <p> For some applications , a simple database may suffice to record a product 's service history -- when it was made , who it shipped to , what modifications have been applied -- while others require a full-on 3D model incorporating real-time sensor data that can be used , for example , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's at the high end of that range that Nvidia plays . <p> At GTC 2022 , the company announced new tools for building digital twins for scientific and engineering applications . Two groups of researchers are already using Nvidia 's Modulus AI framework for developing physics machine learning models and its Omniverse 3D virtual world simulation platform to forecast the weather with greater confidence and speed , and to optimise the design of wind farms . <p> Engineers at Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy are using the Modulus-Omniverse combination to model the placement of wind turbines in relation to one another to maximise power generation and reduce the effects of the turbulence generated by a turbine on its neighbours . <p> While the Siemens-Gamesa model looks at the effects of wind on a zone a few kilometres across , the ambitions of researchers working on FourCastNet are much greater . <p> FourCastNet ( named for the Fourier neural operators used in its calculations ) is a weather forecasting tool trained on 10 terabytes of data . It emulates and predicts extreme weather events such as hurricanes or atmospheric rivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Sydney , Australia , in early March . Nvidia claims it can do so up to 45,000 times faster than traditional numerical prediction models . <p> The system is a first step towards delivering a still more ambitious project that Nvidia calls Earth-2 . It announced in November 2021 that it plans to build a supercomputer using its own chips and use it to create a digital twin of the Earth at 1-meter resolution in its Omniverse software to model the effects of climate change . <p> To help other enterprises build and maintain their own digital twins , later this year Nvidia will offer OVX computing systems running its Omniverse software on racks loaded with its GPUs , storage , and high-speed switch fabric . <p> Nvidia is also introducing Omniverse Cloud to allow creators , designers , and developers to collaborate on 3D designs without needing access to dedicated high-performance computing power of their own , a way for CIOs to temporarily expand their use of the technology without major capital investment . <p> And it 's teaming up with robotics makers and data providers to increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their digital twins better reflect and interact with the real world . <p> It 's already working with retailers Kroger and Lowes , which are using Omniverse to simulate their stores and the logistics chains that supply them . <p> Accelerated learning <p> Machine learning models can be computationally intensive to run , but are even more so to train , as the process requires a system that can crunch through complex calculations on large volumes of data . At GTC2022 , Nvidia is introducing a new GPU architecture , Hopper , designed to speed up such tasks , and showing off the first chip based on it , the H100 . <p> Nvidia said the chip will make it possible to run large language models and recommender systems , increasingly common in enterprise applications , in real time , and includes new instructions that can speed up route optimisation and genomics applications . <p> The ability to segment the GPU into multiple instances -- much like virtual machines in a CPU -- will also make it useful for running several smaller applications , on premises or in the cloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requires less mathematical precision , but greater data throughput , and the H100 's design allows applications to trade one off against the other . The result , says Nvidia , is that systems built with the H100 will be able to train models nine times faster than those using its predecessor , the A100 . <p> Secure computing <p> Nvidia 's said its new H100 chips will also enable it to extend confidential computing capabilities to the GPU , a feature hitherto only available on CPUs . Confidential computing enables enterprises to safely process health or financial data in the secure enclave of a specially designed processor , decrypting it on arrival and encrypting the results before they are sent to storage . <p> The option to securely process such data on a GPU , even in a public cloud or a colocation facility , could enable enterprises to speed up the development and use of machine learning models without scaling up capital spending . <p> When that day comes , Nvidia 's sales to the supercomputing market may take a hit , but in the meantime its chips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantum computing systems <p> Researchers at the intersection of quantum and classical computing have created a low-level machine language called the Quantum Intermediate Representation . Nvidia has developed a compiler for this language , nvq++ , that will first be used by researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory , and an SDK for accelerating quantum workflows , cuQuantum , which is available as a container optimised to run on its A100 GPU . <p> These tools could be useful to CIOs unsure what advantages quantum computing will offer their businesses -- or to those already sure and wanting to help their developers build a quantum skillset at a time when real quantum computers are still laboratory curiosities . <h> Featured <h> Slideshows <p> ?

Sonnenstein is looking for a return on that investment . <p> " We happen to have a lot of stuff on the mainframe . It 's part of our universe . It 's still the beating heart , " Sonnenstein says . M&amp;T , a $6.5 billion institution serving the mid-Atlantic region and headquartered in Buffalo , NY , maintains two data centres , one in Buffalo and the other in Millsboro , Del . Each houses an IBM z15 system . <p> The bank 's use of its mainframes is two-pronged . The first is to run transaction-intensive banking applications , including bank statements , deposits , mobile banking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to host mobile applications , containers , and artificial intelligence ( AI ) applications -- what Sonnenstein calls " acting as a full-fledged member of the modern universe . " <p> IDC analyst Peter Rutten says the bank 's strategy is consistent with the way many organisations are using their mainframes these days . <p> " The core reason for purchasing an IBM Z is these workloads that require massive amounts of transactions at very high speeds , but then the second reason is to use the modernisations on the system to do all these additional value-generating things with it , " he says . <p> According to IDC , IBM sold more than 4,300 IBM Z systems in 2020 , for approximately US$3.5 billion , only three per cent of the worldwide server market in terms of vendor revenue . But size is n't everything , Rutten points out . <p> " Comparing IBM Z to the x86 market is like comparing a Mercedes AMG GT to the total automobile market . Its share is small , but that 's because it serves a unique purpose that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the analyst explains . <p> Not all enterprises are in the market for big iron . After all , entry-level pricing for mainframes in the z15 family running IBM Z operating systems is $250,000 . IBM LinuxONE III systems run only Linux at prices starting at $135,000 . <p> But IBM is softening the capital expense impact of purchasing a mainframe , the performance of which ranges from 267 MIPS on the low end , up to 183,267 MIPS , with its Tailored Fit cloud-like consumption-based pricing model . The program enables customers to pay only for what they use of Z system hardware and software . <p> Z upgrades and open source <p> By continuing to invest in its Z system , IBM is mapping a path to the future for its customers . IBM announced its eight-core Telum processor , which includes an on-chip AI accelerator , in August 2021 . The first Telum-based systems are slated to ship in the first half of this year . IBM 's hardware timetable calls for CPU upgrades approximately every two and a half years . <p> " We have three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R&amp;D in a seven-to-ten-year roadmap , " says Barry Baker , vice-president of product management for IBM Z and LinuxONE at IBM . <p> But hardware alone will not guarantee the future of IBM 's mainframe architecture . The company is also banking heavily on synergies between its Red Hat unit and the Z systems . <p> " We have seen the largest growth where clients augment core systems with open source -- Red Hat Enterprise Linux and OpenShift , " Baker says . <p> The surge in Linux interest reflects the popularity of the operating system across the industry . The compound annual growth rate of Z systems has been between 10 per cent and 13 per cent annually , while Linux has been growing at a CAGR of 24 per cent over the past 15 years , according to Baker . <p> IBM 's customers are not converting older applications to run on Linux but are creating complementary new Linux-based applications , Baker says . Companies might build a new Linux-based mobile app that incorporates some public cloud services , along with direct access to core services on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by live mainframe data can be created quickly , according to Baker . <p> According to IDC 's Rutten , the IBM Z has endured because of IBM 's copious investments , not only in periodic hardware upgrades , but by adding capabilities to work with an ecosystem of open-source software and third-party tools and applications , many of which are made possible through IBM investments . <p> " Being API-enabled , web-enabled , mobile-enabled , cloud-enabled , DevOps-enabled , open-source-enabled , AI-enabled , quantum-safe encryption-enabled , etc. , " ensures that the IBM Z works well with the modern requirements of an enterprise compute platform , Rutten asserts . <p> A modern makeover <p> At M&amp;T Bank , Sonnenstein is dipping deeply into that well of capabilities . For example , the bank is utilising IBM 's Z Digital Integration Hub to stream debit card transaction data in real time via Apache Kafka to a fraud detection engine . In another example , the bank is drawing on mainframe bank balance data to send real-time alerts to mobile customer apps . <p> The initiatives are part of the bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mainframe environments . The strategy includes utilising Zafin 's SaaS offering atop its core z15 platform to enable teams to create and update products and features , and making use of IBM Z/OS Connect to help build and deploy APIs . <p> M&amp;T will also mirror VSAM files with SYSB-II to minimise the impact of overnight batch processing and enable 24x7x365 availability , and leverage IBM Z Digital Integration Hub to simplify on-demand movement of data between the mainframe and other environments , including the cloud . Shifting from overnight to real-time processing will also enable the bank to create new , real-time applications for its customers . <p> All of this is aimed at transitioning M&amp;T to the modern world -- which also means playing well in hybrid cloud environments . <p> " A lot of our investment is to enable customers to use the platform in a hybrid multi-cloud strategy . That 's the future , " Baker says . IBM makes Z system hardware available in its cloud and currently is the only cloud-based service that runs actual Z system hardware . AWS , meanwhile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent announcement , IBM rolled out a basketful of Z series enhancements and services , including IBM Z as-a-service on IBM cloud for software development and testing . IBM Wazi-as-a-service will give developers a protected space in IBM Cloud to develop and test z/OS applications on z/OS virtual servers . Also included in the announcement were tools for developing hybrid cloud applications . <p> " It lowers the barrier to entry for adopting DevOps on the mainframe because developers can use public cloud for their beta and minimum viable product ( MVP ) development , " notes Brent Ellis , senior analyst at Forrester Research . Even so , Ellis says more is needed . <p> " IBM needs an IBM Z cloud offering that is similar in usage and adoption to AWS EC2 , RDS , and DynamoDB -- API-driven , easily provisioned by customers , and scalable without reference to underlying hardware , " the analyst says . " A production IBM Z cloud offering would mean the ability to draw in businesses that are typically too small to acquire mainframe infrastructure . " <p> The need of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's commitment to do what it takes to make that happen . The result is a self-perptuating cycle of demand and supply . " The mainframe going away has been predicted numerous times since the early 1990s . What the doomsayers do n't really understand is how modern the platform is , " IDC 's Rutten says . <p> Sonnenstein agrees , " It took a man to the moon in the 60s and it still works . " And with plenty of tools to adapt it to a very different future , he adds , " It 's not your grandfather 's Buick . " <p> Demand for mainframe skills creates opportunities <p> But a key ingredient for the mainframe 's long-term prospects is talent , and mainframe doubters have long based their pessimism on the gradual disappearance of aging mainframe experts from the workforce and the reluctance of computer science majors to focus on the platform because they fear making a commitment to a dead-end technology . <p> But a realistic assessment takes into account the vital niche mainframes occupy and the need for programmers and operations specialists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Dr. Cameron Seay , adjunct professor at both East Carolina University and Tennessee State University and a board member for the Open Mainframe Project , specialises in mainframe technology education . Seay says mainframe technology is a particularly fertile field of study at historically black colleges and universities ( HBCUs ) , where many students have gained skills that have led to successful careers . <p> " It has been a gold mine . It 's a beautiful niche for students there . Tennessee State is doing a really good job , " Seay says . <p> Mainframe education programs at HCBUs have placed " at least 300 " students in key technology positions at banks , insurance companies , large retailers , and state and federal government agencies , according to Seay . <p> Farther north , M&amp;T Bank launched in November 2020 its Z Development Program ( ZDP ) Mainframe Apprenticeship , a training and internship program that recruits participants from non-traditional backgrounds and underserved communities , particularly Black and Latinx people , as well as women and veterans in the Buffalo area . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the skills to work with IBM Z systems . The program is a collaborative effort that draws on the support of IBM , Franklin Apprenticeships , and the Urban Institute . <p> " M&amp;T is very committed to creating technology onramps in our community . We have a commitment to human capital to not just maintain , but to run new things , " Sonnenstein says . <p> In April 2021 , M&amp;T announced it had hired the first group of 10 graduates of the ZDP to support the bank 's core mainframe applications . The 10 will next embark on a 12-month formal apprenticeship as well as continuous learning and professional development through on-the-job training . <p> " The global economy runs on the mainframe . That 's just a fact , " Seay says . <p> Faced with the perception that only the newest technology is worth pursuing , Seay says outreach is needed : " We need to develop awareness in the general public more than we have .

@@34077237 <p> Network-as-a-service ( NaaS ) is gaining momentum , providing a subscription-based model that eliminates the need for enterprises to own , build , and maintain their own network infrastructure . <p> By replacing conventional hardware-centric VPNs , firewall appliances , load balancers , and MPLS connections , NaaS technology promises adopters the ability to rapidly scale up and down in lockstep with demand while eliminating hardware costs and bolstering network security and service levels . <p> Why enterprises adopt NaaS <p> Enterprises are generally attracted to the NaaS model by the potential to consume scalable network services at a predictable cost while shifting spending from capital expenses to operating expenses , said Robert Smallwood , technology vice president at IT service management firm General Dynamics Information Technology ( GDIT ) . <p> NaaS adoption can also help IT leaders bring limited resources into alignment with strategic business goals . " There 's considerable power in freeing-up an organisation 's internal IT resources to refocus and prioritise on measuring and meeting business objectives , " added John Chambers , director of the network and unified communication solutions team at business consulting firm RSM US . <p> NaaS 's five-year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be adopted by 15 per cent of all enterprises by the end of 2024 , up from less than one per cent in 2021 , he stated . Mordor Intelligence , meanwhile , forecasts a compound annual growth rate ( CAGR ) for NaaS of 33 per cent between 2021 and 2026 . <p> Smallwood sees many enterprises taking a methodical approach to NaaS adoption , beginning with easier and more mature use cases , such as remote access and SD-WAN , and then moving to more holistic services . <p> Leading NaaS vendors include cloud service providers such as Amazon , Microsoft , and Rackspace , as well as traditional communication service providers . Other players include Alkiri , Akamai , Amdoc , Aryaka , Cisco , Megaport , PacketFabric , PaloAlto Networks , and Perimeter 81 . <p> " We see niche vendors continuing to emerge as service gaps are identified , " Smallwood noted . <p> NaaS will continue to grow and mature wherever required network functions can be virtualised and cloud deployed , said Mark Allen , director of network advisory services with technology research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunities will be driven by abstracting network functions away from costly on-premises equipment requirements to easily consumable services with commercial constructs that flex with demand for a given enterprise , " he said . <p> While many vendors claim to provide NaaS service , some offerings are actually little more than an underlying financing construct as opposed to a true service , Allen said . <p> " Today , there are many pure-play ' XaaS ' solutions for various functions previously reliant on physical hardware on the customer premises , " he noted . Security , remote access , and VPN are increasingly being pitched as NaaS services . <p> Pandemic spurs NaaS adoption <p> NaaS early adopters tend to be small-to-mid-sized enterprises carrying relatively low levels of technical debt , as well as agile organisations that are willing to assume a certain degree of risk , Allen said . <p> NaaS is also attracting enterprises struggling with large-scale data flows , such as advertising and e-commerce organisations , plus customers with intense security requirements , including healthcare and financial services enterprises , outlined Alexander Wurm , an analyst with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early adopters include mature enterprises that fully understand the services they will need for long-term success . <p> " These organisations have already adopted other services in an as-a-service model and understand what 's required to successfully move to those delivery models , " Smallwood said . Still other early adopters are enterprises juggling limited budgets that view NaaS as a pathway to reducing some of their capital expenses . <p> The pandemic has also played a significant role in spurring NaaS adoption , Chambers said . <p> " During the early days of COVID-19 there was a rapid push for users to be able to connect quickly , reliably , and securely from anywhere at any time , " he added . " This required many companies to make hardware/software purchases and rapid implementations that accelerated an already noticeable increase in overall network complexity over the last several years . " <p> Unfortunately , many organisations faced serious challenges while trying to keep pace with suddenly essential changes . " Companies that need to quickly scale up or down their network infrastructure capabilities , or those that are on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become prime NaaS-adoption candidates , " Chambers said . <p> It 's easiest for organisations to adopt small-scale NaaS offerings to gain an understanding of how to evaluate potential risk and rewards and determine overall alignment to their company 's requirements . <p> " NaaS providers need to offer different levels of service that allow the enterprise/organisation to pick the degree of NaaS , " Smallwood said . " This could include a hardware-only subscription , a managed service , or a full-blown true NaaS where the provider owns , installs , and operates all the equipment . " <p> Enterprises , meanwhile , will need to look past their initial fear of change and perceived loss of control to " recognise the real benefits that NaaS could provide them , especially in this remote work , security-focused , and more cloud-reliant world , " Chambers detailed . <p> As more services are virtualised and packaged for easy use , the NaaS market will continue to grow rapidly , Allen said . " NaaS will benefit from enterprises continuing to adopt hybrid workforce models , particularly in the post-pandemic era @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the lead-up -- getting the house in order before significant technology change can be successful , " he said . " This involves auditing the network and adequately segmenting functions for transformation to NaaS while determining what to do with those that are not . " <p> Brownfield deployments tend to be more challenging than greenfield installations , Smallwood observed . <p> " For example , in brownfield deployments , there may be compatibility issues where the NaaS vendor 's infrastructure is n't compatible with legacy systems , " he said . " Migrating applications and processes may be challenging if those applications and processes are running in on-premises data centres and not in the cloud . " <p> Another potential stumbling block is that the NaaS provider may have only a limited number of the APIs needed to successfully move legacy network services to the NaaS model . " Having multiple vendors providing different parts of the network services can also complicate moving to NaaS , " Smallwood said . <p> " We often see a chasm between vendor and customer understanding of what 's possible and applicable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marketplace , vendors are stacked at different maturity levels , which colours their definitions and service offerings . He suggested running a Request for Solution ( RFS ) process to determine an appropriate set of vendors . <p> " During the RFS , areas of particular concern should include term commitments , cost , billing structure , and technology utilised , " Allen said . <p> Smallwood recommended testing the NaaS waters with small , clearly identified projects , and moving onto more complex undertakings as experience is gained over time . " We 're seeing an increased interest in as-a-service models such as NaaS , but also a bit of confusion as to how to move organisations from legacy IT models to as-a-service models , " he noted . <p> Perhaps the most challenging NaaS candidates are enterprises running critical applications and systems within their on-premises data centres , not inside a public or private cloud . Such organisations may find shifting to NaaS more difficult than those that are already fully enmeshed in the cloud . <p> For organisations tied to physical data centres , Chambers advised taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " For example , a company considering an SD-WAN implementation could choose a NaaS approach for budgeting , implementation , and ongoing management of the SD-WAN platform , as opposed to a legacy CapEx model of adoption and its inherent limitations and risk -- namely less scalability and flexibility . " <p> Smallwood believes there will be no turning back from NaaS as adoption continues to grow rapidly over the next several years , but it may require a change in attitudes . <p> " Successful adoption of as-a-service models , such as NaaS , are challenged by people with legacy mindsets who are fearful of a lack of control and ca n't definitively identify the measurable outcomes they require from the services , " he said . <h> Featured <h> Slideshows <p> ?

In colder months , compost heaps rarely heat up enough to destroy infective spores of fungoid diseases or the eggs of insect pests , so add only healthy material . <p> Dig over areas that will not have winter crops and apply lime ( 100g per sq m ) . Fresh manure can be added and will decompose over winter . Alternatively , sow oats or barley for digging during October as green manure . <p> Plant out cabbages to mature in spring .

@@34092231 <p> Analysis - Tomorrow 's minimum wage increase to NZ$21.20 an hour should help a significant number of New Zealand 's lowest paid workers and their families - 300,000 people , according to the government . <p> Just how much it will help , however , is less certain . <p> Photo : 123RF <p> At 6 percent , the increase is in line with the 5.9 percent annual rise in the consumer price index ( CPI ) in the December 2021 quarter .

" <p> But other economists have argued against this - for example , David Card and Alan Krueger , who published several controversial empirical works in the 1990s finding increasing the minimum wage does not necessarily lead to fewer jobs . <p> Not everyone agrees with Card and Krueger , however . <p> David Neumark and William Wascher evaluated the evidence and argued minimum wages do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who are most directly affected by minimum wage " . <p> So , there is no real academic consensus on minimum wages - and not even much agreement on what the research literature really says . <h> Effects on poverty <p> Given all this , perhaps the better question is whether minimum-wage policies reduce poverty overall . But again , the research has been contradictory . <p> In one New Zealand study in 2012 , researchers found minimum wages do not guarantee people will escape poverty . Another study using Irish data also concluded that minimum wages may be " a blunt instrument " for tackling poverty . <p> On the other hand , a 2021 US study found significant positive employment effects for single mothers with aged children five and under , suggesting minimum wages at least have potential as a policy instrument for reducing child poverty . <p> This is particularly relevant in New Zealand for two reasons : one in five Maori children and one in four Pasifika children meet the criteria for material hardship , and Pacific people and Maori represent 10 percent and 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wage just one tool <p> What does seem clear is that minimum wage policies are most effective as part of a complementary income support bundle , as some overseas research has shown and which was supported by a comprehensive review of minimum wage policies in New Zealand . <p> Examining the effects on various economic outcomes since 2000 , the authors argued that minimum wage policies should be " designed and evaluated in the context of other income support policies " . <p> Those other supports include the Families Package introduced in 2018 , which included an increase to the accommodation supplement , designed to help low income earners with rent , board or mortgages ( but is not available to those in public housing ) . <p> The same authors recently investigated the impact of increases in the maximum accommodation supplement rates to see if these had simply been swallowed by rising accommodation costs . <p> Their findings were encouraging : more than 90% of the increase in assistance was captured by the recipients as an increase in after-rent income . A minimum wage policy has a greater chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . <p> But it 's important such complementary policies are synchronised , especially given only some other social policies , such as Working for Families , are inflation-adjusted . <h> Getting the mix right <p> Elsewhere , these policy combinations have been effective . In the United States , for example , the Earned Income Tax Credit ( EITC ) - as its title suggests , a refundable tax credit similar to New Zealand 's Working for Families policy - has been shown to benefit low-wage workers and families in combination with a modest increase in the minimum wage . <p> Again , the combination of policies works better than either in isolation , and some recent studies suggest EITC expansions and minimum wage hikes should be thought of in tandem as complementary policies . <p> However , one of the big challenges of integrating minimum wage settings with other policies is that each tool affects many economic outcomes . What should be the optimal level of minimum wages ? How do minimum wage hikes interact with other supporting policies ? <p> While there have been some official efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state interventions , this needs to go further in order to find the right policy mix - especially during a year that will see continued high inflation , low growth and economic uncertainty . <p> *Murat Ungor is a senior lecturer in economics at the University of Otago .

Shane Te Pou ( Ngati Raka , Ngai Tuhoe ) spoke with the rangatira . <p> Ngai Tahu are the southernmost inhabitants of Polynesian civilisation , one built by brave and courageous navigators . Never content to stay within the safe boundaries of their known world , they set off traversing the unknown to discover new lands and forge a new destiny for their people . Following in the footsteps of his navigator ancestors , Ta Tipene has led the way in forging a new destiny for Ngai Tahu , guided by seven generations of our people to address the injustices of the past and to build a better future . This journey was never smooth , like his ancestor Rakaihautu , Ta Tipene had to navigate stormy seas , had to keep the crew committed to the cause , had to secure the vessel to weather the oceans and tides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach a new destiny previously thought unachievable . He has made an indelible mark on Ngai Tahu today and for our future generations to come . His legacy is one of leading a new destiny for Ngai Tahu and the nation , teaching us to reclaim our ability to dream and to remember who we are in order to create a new and better future . <p> When I asked Sir Tipene O'Regan what triggered his consciousness on matters of racial justice , he shared a jarring anecdote that captured the climate pervading the 1950s Wellington of his childhood . <p> His father , Rolland O'Regan , was in the sights of New Zealand 's security services due to his support for striking waterfront workers in 1951 . Nine years later , he would spearhead the " No Maoris , No Tour " movement , placing the renowned surgeon , son of a judge , and devout Irish Catholic , on the far radical fringe of New Zealand politics at the time . The prolonged wharf dispute ripped New Zealand apart in a way that remained unparalleled until exactly three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'Regan willed into existence had evolved into a mass protest movement . <p> Returning from school one day as the 1951 strike raged on , young Tipene encountered the menacing sight of police officers ransacking his family home in Roseneath , a salubrious Wellington suburb overlooking Oriental Bay . <p> " These Eliot Ness types gathered in raincoats and felt hats , with Fords and Mercurys parked around our house . I realised they were the police , " Sir Tipene recalls . <p> His Ngai Tahu mother , Rena , stood at the front door , lamenting " aue ... aue " at the intrusion , hands in wiri formation , reclaiming her dignity , defending her home , protecting her boy . <h> Advertisement <p> " And I remember a man came out whom I recognised from church and he said to his colleagues , ' Do n't worry about her going on , she 's just a white n***** ' . She grabbed my hand , told me not to do anything rash . ' Stay still . Behave yourself . ' <p> " I remember my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She would n't say anything , just gave him a look as if to say she forgave him . She was a woman of considerable grace but I do n't think she really forgave him . She always taught me , ' Forgive thine enemies , my son , but write down their names . ' " <h> Related articles <p> It was a truly bicultural upbringing , and Sir Tipene credits the early influence of his maternal grandmother for lighting his path into te ao Maori and towards a life dedicated to seeking justice for Ngai Tahu . <p> " She was the keeper of that body of grievance within our broader whanau . " <p> Meanwhile , Sir Tipene 's later reputation as an advocate and negotiator , the breadth of his intellectual interests , his passion for justice , were forged in that same Roseneath home . <p> " I always had books around me and a lot of conversations , " Sir Tipene , 83 , told me in an interview for Canvas after being honoured with the award , New Zealander of the Year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a meal at our home were sometimes astonished by the way I was permitted at the table to talk to my father . My mother would say , ' I wish you would n't be so bolshie ' but this was met with silence at the head of the table . ' The boy is debating with me ' - and that would excuse just about anything . My father 's intellect had a huge shape on me . He was very interested in my personal development . " <p> The debating skills and intellectual rigour honed at the dining room table serve Sir Tipene well . His dealings with former National Party Minister of Treaty Negotiations , Chris Finlayson , extends back 30 years , culminating in direct negotiations over the Fisheries Commission Treaty settlement for Ngai Tahu . <p> " We always found him to be an honest , robust , good-faith actor , " said Finlayson , who later enlisted Sir Tipene to help sell the Tuhoe settlement . " Could not have asked for a better friend and mentor . " <p> Jackson shares with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treaty settlements , which he describes as " peanuts " . <p> " However , our people learned from Ngai Tahu that you can still create opportunity from peanuts , and you can still make dreams happen . That is one of the legacies of O'Regan . <p> " Twenty-six years after the Ngai Tahu settlement their $170 million has turned into billions . Tipene was right after all . " <p> It 's hard to disagree with Jackson 's argument about the inadequacy of Treaty settlements in light of the grievances they seek to address , but no account of the Ngai Tahu deal can afford to ignore the prevailing political climate from which it emerged . <p> As then-Prime Minister Jim Bolger sat across the table from Sir Tipene in the 90s , the fate of Treaty settlements was far from assured . Public opinion veered between sceptical and hostile towards the entire endeavour , and some inside the governing National Party believed any deal would doom their electoral fortunes . That Bolger and others stood firm , signing off on the Ngai Tahu settlement and pursuing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an act of impressive political courage . By taking settlements off the red hot stove of day-to-day political combat , by rejecting the allure of demagoguery , political leaders from both sides helped save us from decades of racial strife , perhaps the single best explanation for why New Zealand has so far avoided falling into the destructive populism poisoning democracies elsewhere . <p> Would this have been possible without the vision , leadership and first-class temperament of Sir Tipene ? At the very least , surely it would have been a great deal more perilous without him . <p> Ta Tipene O'Regan , long-time chair of Ngai Tahu Trust Board and chief negotiator , and his daughter Hana , who works for Te Runanga o Ngai Tahu as general manager of oranga ( health ) . <p> This is not to say race relations are optimal at this or any other time of our shared journey as a nation , let alone to suggest our aspirations as Maori are even close to fully realised . Sir Tipene , having steered the waka from the vanguard , knows that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to others . But the next generation of Ngai Tahu 's leaders are under no illusion about the indispensability of this towering rangatira . <p> Broadcaster and te reo activist Stacey Morrison ( Ngai Tahu ) put it this way : " He is such a pou the mighty pillar that rises up from the heart of the wharenui - a true stalwart of knowledge and experience for our iwi . He links us to our old people , he is one of the core negotiators and navigators who fought for our iwi for the benefit of all of our tamariki and mokopuna , and those still to be born , much more than it was ever for themselves . " <p> When I ask what Sir Tipene hopes his legacy will be to his mokopuna , these are the words with which we conclude our korero . <p> " I 'd like to think that my mokopuna were educated with a broad and liberal view of life . And they are dealing with the issues of their day fuelled and fired by an understanding of where they 've come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them will be full sailboats . I hope some of them will .

And they know that ' Aoraki Matatu ' - Aoraki continues to endure - and as long as that endures , we endure . " <p> In the submissions for Kiwibank New Zealander of the Year , a nominator summed up the mana of Ta Tipene : " While Ngai Tahu as an iwi and New Zealand as a nation are bigger than any one person , few people think or act in big ways . These people , living taonga , are irreplaceable . Ta Tipene O'Regan is one such person . "

Battery Electric Vehicles ( BEVs ) do n't have engines as such , so they do n't really need grilles . The bits that need it can be cooled in other ways , because they 're not all stuck right up at the front of the car . <p> But most BEVs still have grilles anyway , and that 's kind of weird . How come ? The obvious answer is branding . Or style . Which are the same thing in the car world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a key element of most internal combustion-engined vehicles for over a century , so carmakers have taken that need for a great big hole at the front of the car and turned it into a branding opportunity . You can generally tell what kind of car you 're looking at ... by looking at the grille . <p> So even as carmakers have embraced BEV technology , they 've tended to keep grilles . Even those brands with zero ICE-history : the first Tesla Model S had a faux-grille and though it 's been downsized and reshaped , there 's still a suspicious T-shaped slat on the latest Model S and Model X. <p> Arguably the brand best placed to transition to a sans-grille BEV future is Porsche . The rear-engined 911 has established an instantly recognisable look that 's easily replicated by the Taycan . <p> BEV " grilles " can do other things of course .

How do you stand over the ball having just shanked it , remove that doubt and that feeling and really trust . When you are happy with golf and enjoying it you play your best , which is exactly the same with athletics .

" I ca n't do attention to detail so I employed someone to check my chapters and I 'm so behind , " she says . <p> Policymakers are starting to suspect the condition is a factor behind the labour shortages seen in the US and UK , where many older workers are looking to work fewer hours or have left the workforce completely . One study by the Brookings Institution in January speculated that long Covid could potentially account for upwards of 15 per cent of the 10.6m unfilled jobs in the US . <p> " It does n't matter whether you drive the truck , you work the cash register at McDonald 's or you run a Fortune 500 company .

On April 5 , the Biden administration said it would scale up national research on long Covid , and directed federal agencies to support sufferers as they seek treatment and attempt to return to work . <p> An estimated 100 million people worldwide are suffering from long Covid , a debilitating condition where Covid symptoms linger for 12 weeks or more . Photo / AP <p> But in the meantime , activists say employers need to recognise not just their own responsibilities but also the potential impact on their businesses . " We are talking about ? . ? . ? . ? people who are in the prime of their lives , who are also at the prime of their earning potential , " Berrent says . <h> A crunch point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ globally is unknown : very few countries collect data on the incidence of long Covid , and employers are not always aware of cases among their staff , who often struggle to get a diagnosis , or are reluctant to disclose their condition for fear it will affect their position . <h> Advertisement <p> But in some countries , labour market data give an idea of how long-term health issues grew during the pandemic . In the US , where long Covid can qualify as a disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act , labour force data show the number of civilians with a disability who are working or seeking work grew by 1.36m , a 23 per cent increase , between January 2021 and January 2022 . <p> Meanwhile , UK labour market data show a rise of some 200,000 since the start of the pandemic in the number of people who are not working or job-seeking because of long-term ill health ; and a quarter of UK companies say long Covid is one of the main causes of long-term staff absence . <p> The UK also publishes an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimated 1.2m people said in March they had persistent long Covid symptoms lasting at least 12 weeks , with women , people aged between 35 and 49 , health workers and teachers most affected . A total of 784,000 said they had been suffering for at least a year , and 322,000 said it limited their day to day activities " a lot " . <p> " I think we 're in for a much bigger problem , " says Clare Rayner , a former consultant occupational physician who had long Covid , who is helping to develop services for sufferers . <p> She believes the numbers affected will become more visible as businesses ask staff to return to offices and as some NHS employers , who have so far kept health workers on full pay while on Covid-related sick leave , withdraw this support . <p> " There 's a crunch point coming very , very soon , " Rayner says , adding that she was increasingly seeing people being " managed out " if they were unable to return full time . <p> Twycross , the former lecturer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affected by long Covid and encountered many people who have dropped managerial responsibilities , cut their hours or been forced to resign . What concerns her is " how badly they are treated when they try to return to work " , she says . " They are having to fight to get an extended phased return . " <p> Research by the UK 's Trades Union Congress found that a quarter of employees with long Covid had not dared tell their employer , while a fifth faced questions about the impact of their symptoms and one in 20 had felt forced to retire , resign or take redundancy . " We have a significant workplace issue , a growing issue , " says Sue Coe , TUC senior policy officer . <p> Businesses need to be giving " massive support and tailored advice " to employees with long Covid , Rayner adds . " If we do n't , these people are going to be on benefits , losing their house . Employers are losing a massive amount of talent . Employers need to look at the big picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global companies are now beginning to see the condition as a serious risk to their business . <p> Stephen Bevan , head of HR research development at the UK 's Institute for Employment Studies , says the issue was " high on the agenda " for the newly influential chief medical officers of large European companies , who had " a direct line of sight between long Covid and lost capacity " and were seeking to intervene early to minimise the cost of covering long-term absences with bank and agency staff . <p> He was also working with multinationals worried about the potential disruption to their operations in emerging markets such as Brazil and India where Covid had hit hard . <p> Smaller companies may also be forced to develop policies to address the condition . In the US , where employers must make " reasonable accommodations " to allow a person assessed as having a disability to continue in their jobs , lawyers say lawsuits relating to long Covid are becoming more common as companies ask staff to return to the office . <p> The US Equal Employment Opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violated in relation to Covid during 2020 and 2021 . Although the agency does not distinguish between Covid and long Covid claims , it published guidance for employers in December to alert them about the issue . <p> " We are still seeing cases filed that are linked to terminations due to Covid and have n't yet seen the mother lode of long Covid cases yet , " says Salvatore Gangemi , partner at Murtha Cullina , a US law firm . <p> Damages awards under discrimination laws could run to millions of dollars , he adds . " I think what the EEOC is doing by issuing guidance is trying to get out in front of this problem . Companies really need to engage or at least attempt to engage with employees who raise these issues . " <p> While UK courts are yet to rule on the legal status of long Covid , lawyers say many sufferers would have good cases to be treated as disabled , entitling them to reasonable adjustments to help them do their job . <p> But it will take a concerted effort on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , benefits systems and a workplace culture that currently fails many people with chronic health conditions . <p> Coe says the " shocking " treatment many employees with long Covid had received was " not surprising , given the broader experience of disabled workers " , who often found employers unwilling to grant flexibility around shift patterns , rest breaks , homeworking or changes to their duties . <h> Working with the condition <p> Sufferers of long Covid hoping to return to work have few treatment options , as researchers are only starting to define the condition . <p> Doctors have experimented with a range of existing drugs while pharmaceutical companies are developing new treatments targeted at symptoms such as muscle fatigue or lung scarring , but none are in phase 3 trials . In the UK and the US , long Covid clinics offer mental healthcare and physiotherapy , but waiting lists are long . <p> Working with the condition is further complicated by its unpredictable nature : symptoms vary wildly and fluctuate unexpectedly , with many sufferers finding even mild exertion brings on a relapse . <p> This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " phased return " to their usual hours and duties , typically over a four-week period -- set people up to fail , as do " absence management " policies that often seem designed to catch malingerers , not to support those genuinely struggling . <p> Jenny Ceolta-Smith , an occupational therapist who suffers from long Covid , says she tried twice to return to her job as a lecturer but found it impossible , even after paying privately for help with fatigue management . " I typically try to go out for a short walk once a week , it might be around the block or a little longer ? . ? . ? . ? At times I 'm completely wiped out , " she says . <p> Her employer was willing to cut her hours , but not for her to work purely from home : she eventually felt she had no option but to agree to leave and later claim benefits . She has since taken a position as an associate lecturer , working a few hours a week from home . <p> " Your hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lesley Macniven , a consultant and long Covid campaigner , who suffered a " massive relapse " recently after being asked to deliver a training session in a community library that she had previously been running online . " The process of getting there and back really knocked me for six ? . ? . ? . ? It 's one job but it 's a job I really value and do n't want to lose , " she says . <p> Occupational health professionals say long Covid sufferers should not be placed on protracted sick leave , since long periods of worklessness are also damaging . Instead , they should be allowed to return at a far more gentle , gradual pace , with adjustments tailored to their specific circumstances and co-ordinated support from HR , line managers and colleagues . <p> " As with cancer , it 's very much a collective effort to get people back to work , " says Veronica Swainson , who has led a specialist work rehabilitation programme for staff at the King 's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in London -- one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- which has helped about 130 of a 13,000-strong workforce since the summer of 2020 . <p> People typically take about three months to build back up to their usual hours while on full pay , Swainson says , but the type of support offered varies widely . Someone suffering from fatigue might receive cab vouchers to avoid an exhausting commute , while a senior manager struggling to multitask might be given an assistant to help plan their day . <p> Anne de Bono , a consultant in occupational medicine who sits on the NHS long Covid task force , says special care is needed for workers in safety-critical roles , citing the case of a surgeon at her hospital who had been given a " trusted buddy " to work with as he regained his confidence . <p> But this kind of intensive support is exceptional , even within the NHS , which is acutely aware of the risk long Covid poses to its own strained workforce . In a few countries -- the Netherlands among them -- employers must take responsibility for staff who fall sick . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as is access to occupational healthcare , and even if staff are covered by insurance schemes , insurers can be unwilling to pay . In the US , federal law does not require businesses to offer any sick pay at all , though some states , cities and counties do . <p> Yet if employers rise to the challenge long Covid represents , they stand to gain -- while helping people who have spent the past two years fighting to regain their health and livelihood to relaunch their careers . " Life changes -- the person has to adapt to the condition . But their recovery is positive over time . They return to some kind of normality , " Swainson says . <p> Lazell-Fairman is hopeful medical research will produce new treatments that can help long Covid sufferers get back to work . But she says a more supportive framework from both employers and health authorities is required to deal with the huge numbers of sufferers . <p> " It 's a pandemic .

@@90061236 <h> Efficiency of appliances <p> People often think that heating rooms consumes the most energy , Gretton says , but the average New Zealand household consumes about a third of energy on keeping warm , a third on heating water , and a third on everything else - lighting , cooking , appliances etc . <p> The surprise for some , he says , is when they find out that running their old fridge is costing them about $150 a year . <p> But the development of more efficient fridges is looking to set things right , with annual electricity consumption from fridges going down by half over the past 20 years , he says . <p> " I said the old one that might be in the garage , if that was a 20-year-old one , it 's costing you $150 but the new one might be costing you something like $75 . " <p> The same goes for clothes dryers - Gretton says old ones will be using about a $1.30 of electricity for a single load . <p> " With clothes dryers ... there 's some new ones that are coming out and becoming much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " They are actually quite a bit more efficient so their power use would be something around half that , so that 's definitely something worth considering for someone who does use a clothes dryer quite a lot , like a big family . " <p> If you do n't have the budget to splash out on newer appliances , you could look at making your existing appliances run more smoothly . For example , try cleaning your heat pump 's indoor filters once a month during winter so the fan inside uses less power , Gretton says . <p> " Also make sure that with the outdoor unit of the heat pump , that the air circulation around it is nice and clear because any obstructions to that air circulation will make it hard for it to do its job . <p> " And you might give it a little bit of a gentle clean . Outdoor units have loads of fairly thin aluminum fins on them so you do n't want to be going and attacking it with a hose pipe or anything but if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brush , that would help . " <p> Gretton says the myth that it 's better to keep your heat pump running in one go instead of switching it on and off as needed is not quite so true for saving costs . <p> One thing to consider about heat pumps though is that they are most efficient when running at lower temperatures . <p> " So that 's down around 18C . But we do realise 18C might be a little bit on the cooler side for some people , so our guidance is to think about 18C to 20C for the sort of optimum balance between energy conservation and comfort . " <h> Insulation <p> Draughts are pretty bad in New Zealand houses , Gretton says , and the best way to find out where they are is to feel them as you walk around your house on a windy day . <p> " It will be making quite a big impact on your ability to heat your house . " <p> Draught-proofing and sealing of windows and doors can help keep the elements at bay . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store would be a foam rubber type thing that you 'd use around your windows . <p> " So you 'd open up your windows , you 'd give them a good clean , the frames that is , then you 'd get these draught-proofing products ... which are often self-adhesive so it makes them quite easy to apply and then you stick them to your existing frames . " <p> Double glazed windows are big tick-off item if you are retrofitting a cold house , but they need to be good quality to make a difference , Gretton says . <p> " If you 've got single-glazed timber frame windows and you 've replaced those with fairly low-quality double glazing on aluminum windows then the percentage gain that you would get might not be that much . <p> " Whereas if you have good quality thermally broken aluminum or PVC or indeed timber and you go for low E double glazing , which means it 's got a special coating on it which reduces the heat loss and also has argon between the panes of glass , then that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then that 's when you are able to reduce your heat loss by about half . " <p> A more budget-friendly option would be to look at getting thicker curtains , which would act like insulation , he says . <p> " You really want long curtains that span down from the window ledge . If you 've got window ledges that are already quite low in the wall , then taking the curtains all the way down to the floor is something that helps because that reduces the flow of air around the curtain . " <h> Ventilation <p> Just as important as stopping the warm air from escaping is ventilation , Gretton says . But are the systems worth the money ? <p> It is possible to ventilate a house or room yourself , he says , but it can be worthwhile to invest in a system if you have problems with dampness and are n't able to leave windows slightly ajar during the day . <p> " We advise that the best way to ventilate your house is to open your windows really wide for something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that 's especially good for things like bedrooms where you can get a bit of moisture build-up overnight ... and then you 're able to let it heat up again during the day . <p> " It 's really a balance of getting the right amount of ventilation , which as I say with ventilation systems they kind of do that without you having to think about it , whereas with open and closing windows it 's a bit more of a balance because you 're having to adjust it for all sorts of things like how windy it is outside . " <p> Installing moisture barriers under the house is one way to protect your home from dampness , he says . <p> " If you do n't have good ventilation under your house - and this is obviously thinking about traditional timber buildings with suspended floors - then there can be a lot of water that actually evaporates off from the ground underneath the house and ultimately ends up in your house , contributing to your house getting damp .

" <p> When it comes to symptoms and diagnosing Hodgkin , Petitt says this cancer " typically presents with swollen glands in the neck , or other body regions , and sometimes shortness of breath or cough associated with swollen lymph nodes in the chest .

It was a probing and wide-ranging discussion that 's worth viewing in full , but there was one exchange in particular that I keep thinking about , finding myself more and more gobsmacked each time . It began with Moana seeking Luxon 's understanding of the central tenets of Te Tiriti , namely kawanatanga ( governorship ) and rangatiratanga ( sovereignty ) : <p> Maniapoto : Do you think that it 's feasible that Maori would have ceded sovereignty ? Luxon : Well , that 's ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Treaty , you know , that 's what that 's about.Maniapoto : Te Tiriti.Luxon : ... of the Treaty.Maniapoto : Te Tiriti.Luxon : Well , we have different **25;6379;TOOLONG : No , what is in Te Tiriti ? Luxon : Well , what I 'm saying to you is , I think that that , you know , I 'm looking at the articles ... the first article was really about ceding sovereignty - that we 're one country ... Maniapoto : No , it 's not.Luxon : ... the second article was about rangatiratanga , that the people can have ... Maniapoto : So you 're talking about the English text that was signed by about 50 people . <p> To the uninitiated , Maniapoto 's repeated insistence on the term " Te Tiriti " may come across as if she 's pressing him to use the Maori term for The Treaty of Waitangi , perhaps out of political correctness or cultural sensitivity . Of course , as becomes apparent , it 's nothing of the sort . Maniapoto is simply clarifying her question by stressing " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luxon know she is referring to kawanatanga and rangatiratanga as spelt out in Maori language text . <p> Repeat viewings of this interaction do Luxon no favours , and nor does even a cursory analysis of what the floundering cluelessness of those moments say about his values and priorities . <p> In National Party circles , his supporters have been saying for some time that Luxon shares many of John Key 's strengths . Photo / Dean Purcell <p> I 'm anxious to avoid hyperbole here , but it 's hard not to conclude this : Luxon seeks to replace Jacinda Ardern as New Zealand 's Prime Minister , claiming he has the knowledge and expertise necessary to do that job and do it well . And yet , he has chosen not to acquaint himself with basic facts central to the nation 's founding -- basic historical and constitutional facts you would expect a bright 10-year-old to know . Add to that the audacity to urge the Government to clarify what " co-governance " means when he has n't bothered to educate himself , even to a Wikipedia level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is built . <p> Since it 's safe to assume someone as accomplished as Luxon does not suffer from laziness , there must be some other reason why he opts to remain so ignorant on a subject you do n't merely expect Prime Ministers to grasp , you would expect the chief executive of our national airline to be pretty well across it too . <p> In National Party circles , his supporters have been saying for some time that Luxon shares many of John Key 's strengths . This makes sense on a superficial level : both were successful businessmen who spent extended periods of time abroad and have chosen to commit to politics after achieving their impressive career goals . <p> And yet , I 'm not sure those similarities will end up being as important as the differences between the trader ( Key ) and the institutional CEO ( Luxon ) . The most glaring point of difference comes down to their attitude towards risk . The CEO spends all day and night mitigating risk , especially so with a company as weighed down by stakeholders as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Key , on the other hand , risk is the true currency of choice , and success is measured by how quickly you can turn it into profit . What the trader personality manifested in Key was a comfort with spontaneity , extremely fast reaction times , and an almost superhuman capacity to read a room . As Luxon 's interview with Moana Maniapoto showed , as did subsequent outings with Jack Tame , Tova O'Brien and Kim Hill , those risk-averse CEO traits were in abundance , but none of the currency dealer 's fleet footedness and disarming humour . In the end , Luxon may come to regret the lack of scrutiny during his honeymoon phase . It served only to raise expectations among the political and media elite , and this , in turn , has made this week 's performances seem all the more woeful . <p> Just as Labour might have been better off in hindsight for Phil Goff and his then deputy Annette King to have swapped jobs , perhaps National will be wondering if they erred by putting Luxon ahead of Nicola @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different league altogether , and something tells me Willis is not the sort who seeks to govern countries without reading its history first . <p> * Shane Te Pou ( Ngai Tuhoe ) is a company director at Mega Ltd , a commentator and blogger and a former Labour Party activist .

Yesterday , the Government announced consultation on what will probably become a levy-funded managed retreat mechanism . <p> This looks like electoral poison : a handful of levies and charges , plus a likely wealth tax . <p> But perhaps not . <p> Parker 's Tuesday speech offered up unlikely praise for former finance minister Bill English 's " master class in the politics of changing the tax mix " when he sold an increase in GST and cuts to income tax as a " tax switch " in 2010 . <p> Parker also called this " switch " a misrepresentation , which is perhaps why Labour avoided similar tactics with its 2019 attempt at a Capital Gains Tax , despite the fact the Tax Working Group 's terms of reference committed it to recommending no taxes that would raise substantially more revenue than was already being collected . <p> The argument Labour is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that they 'll save the tax and ratepayers over the long run . <p> Unemployment , climate , and water charges are already born by central and local Government . In the case of unemployment insurance , Finance Minister Grant Robertson has argued the scheme will simply pre-fund a more efficient and cost-effective form of economic support than what was cobbled together during the pandemic . Likewise Climate Change Minister James Shaw told media yesterday the Government was already picking up the tab for climate change adaptation - the policy out for consultation simply asks questions of whether it should defray those costs more fairly ( on to property owners , for example ) . <p> Parker 's tax research fits into this narrative because its findings will likely show that New Zealand 's wealthiest are n't paying their share of the tax . This makes it easy to argue that not only are New Zealand 's strained public services in need of dedicated funding , but the very people who should be paying proportionately more into those services , have been paying proportionately less than most people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " squeezed middle " are squeezed because they 're paying too much tax - but only because , in Parker 's terms , the top are n't being squeezed hard enough . <p> If Parker really is serious that English led a " master class " in tax politics in 2010 , it 's not difficult to imagine Labour heading to the 2023 election with a middle-class income tax cut , paid for by a switch and squeeze on the wealthy . <p> National could find itself in difficulty if Labour were able to propose income tax cuts that could at least hold a candle to their own . National will need more than $3b to pay for its tax cuts , half of which will go to people on middle incomes . It 's not difficult to see Labour looking at ways of funding smaller , but similar middle-income tax cuts by rinsing the rich a bit more . <p> Such a policy would further emphasise the amount of money the party is planning to throw at cutting the 39 per cent threshold - something leader Christopher Luxon is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softening his language around . <p> Labour has booby-trapped the 39 per cent rate by placing the threshold of the tax so high that only the top 3 per cent of income earners pay it . Last time National repealed the 39 per cent rate , fiscal drag meant the number of people ensnared by the 39 per cent rate was in the low double digits , roughly four times more than today . The tax rate may be the same , the threshold very much is not . <p> National should recall that this is still a very centrist Labour Party . It can try to shift the political focus to Labour 's left , but it might find that Labour 's focus remains fixed on the centre .

@@90407240 <h> Claire Trevett <p> The rapid-fire decision-making and law-making the Government resorted to during the Covid-19 outbreak has now resulted in it getting at least two bloodied noses dispensed by the High Court . <p> The latest is this week'sHigh Court decision taken by Grounded Kiwis against the Government 's operation of MIQ at the end of last year - a period which saw the chances of getting back into the country put in the hands of lady luck and a vast number of stories of Kiwis in distressing situations struggling to return home . Pregnant journalist Charlotte Bellis was one of the most high profile - but she was also the tip of the iceberg . <p> As with an earlier court decision which found mandates in the police and defence force were unlawful , the MIQ decision was on limited points . <p> It will have come to the Government 's relief that the courts did not find MIQ as a whole was unlawful , nor the requirements for isolation periods , although Grounded Kiwis had not argued those were unlawful . <p> It was a fairly narrow judgment which found that the use of the lobby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were dealt with in the last few months of 2021 had fallen short . <p> But it contained words no Government should ever want to see : that unfairness in the way it operated that system imposed unjustified limitations on the rights of its people -- in this case , the right of a New Zealander to come home . <p> Governments like to take credit for what they get right , but they should also take accountability for the things they get wrong . <h> Related articles <p> The Opposition -- National 's Chris Bishop and Act 's David Seymour -- are claiming vindication from the ruling that the use of the lobby system and management of the emergency allocations unjustifiably infringed on Kiwis ' rights to come home . <p> It was something both had pushed hard on last year , and urged changes -- the same changes the court suggested could have been useful . <p> Whatever spin is put on the judgment , what is indisputable is both that MIQ was crucial in New Zealand 's ability to keep Covid-19 out for so long -- and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> That is why the verdict in the court of public opinion has sometimes differed from that in the courts of law . <p> Public polling showed high levels of support for MIQ and mandates throughout , even after the heartache it delivered ratcheted up in the last months of 2021 . <p> But the court 's verdict is a crucial check on a government , especially a government which has pushed through laws that impact on peoples ' rights with very little in the way of the usual public input and debate . That has been the case with lockdowns , with vaccine mandates and with border closures . <h> Advertisement <p> Grounded Kiwis MIQ petitioners present a petition on MIQ for returning New Zealanders at Parliament .

( The courts have also since ruled that the mandates in the health workforce are lawful , because different rules apply ) . <p> An appeal might seem redundant , given MIQ ( touch wood ) is no longer in use for New Zealanders at least . <p> But there are two compelling reasons for appealing it : one is the potential issue of whether compensation will be sought by those who missed out on MIQ slots because of the criteria being used . ( Though Grounded Kiwis has not sought damages ) . <p> The more important one is to test whether the legal reasoning will stand in a higher court -- not only on the elements in which the High Court found against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and isolation were lawful . <p> When extraordinary powers are being used by a Government and it has been found wanting , it has to be tested fully -- in case those same powers are needed again . <p> It would take a very brave government to bring back MIQ , one of the necessary evils of Covid-19.

@@90433233 <h> MIQ system should have been adjusted <p> The injustices of the blunt MIQ lottery system that spawned a steady stream of negative stories last year for the Government , especially of trauma for Kiwis unable to farewell dying loved ones , have been confirmed by a High Court decision released yesterday . <p> In the face of those stories and advocacy of proposed changes by Opposition MPs aimed at addressing the concerns being raised , the Government seemed to consign the issues to the " too hard " basket . <p> Justice Jillian Mallon found that the combination of the virtual lobby and narrow emergency criteria meant New Zealanders ' rights to enter their country were infringed , " in some instances in a manner that was not demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society " . <p> Essentially the system was not geared to consider individual circumstances or the prioritisation of returning citizens . Instead , almost everyone had to simply try their luck with a virtual lobby where demand generally exceeded the supply of managed isolation rooms by a large factor . Criteria for emergency allocation of rooms was set too tightly , the judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delays were not prioritised . <p> Yesterday Covid-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins acknowledged the ruling and said the lobby system " may have infringed " on some citizens ' right to enter New Zealand .

@@90566234 <p> With recent statistics suggesting that 70% of jobs in New Zealand require a driver 's licence , Workbridge is urging employers to think carefully about whether a licence is absolutely necessary before advertising a vacancy . <p> Workbridge says it is delighted by the Government 's recently announced initiative to improve access to driver 's licence training and testing , believing it will be life-changing for many who have found it difficult to obtain a licence due to financial constraints . <p> But the largest New Zealand-owned employment agency assisting disabled people and others who face challenges gaining employment says that at a time when it is difficult for employers to recruit , they could inadvertently be missing out on great people if they impose unnecessary constraints on who can apply for a job . <p> " There are jobs where driving is a core function of the role , and of course a licence is essential for those , " says Jonathan Mosen , Workbridge 's Chief Executive . <p> " But we often see job ads saying a driver 's licence is essential , when all that is required is travel from point A to B @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slip in a driver 's licence requirement because they think this will ensure that the employee will make it to work on time .

@@90678232 <h> Staying Inside The Lines . <p> DOES THIS GOVERNMENT have the gumption to go on the offensive against its National and Act opponents ? The evidence , to date , suggests not . All we have seen from Jacinda Ardern and her colleagues since National eclipsed Labour in the polls is the risible politics of " anything you can do I can do better " . Imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery , but , in electoral politics , flattering your enemies is not a winning formula . <p> At the core of the Government 's supine response to National 's reflexive policy kicks : tax-cuts , reduced spending , fuelling moral panics on education and youth offending , getting tough on gangs , racist dog-whistling on He Puapua and co-governance ; is the Centre-Left 's besetting fear that fighting-back against the Right will cost it votes . <p> Teasing out this core anxiety , it soon becomes clear that the Centre-Left 's fear arises from its conviction that the overwhelming majority of the electorate is susceptible to the ideological arguments of the Right . That being the case , it only makes sense for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Me , too ! " <p> But , if the electorate is susceptible to the Right 's policy pitches , then it is only because it has been years since they heard the Left come to them with anything remotely resembling a passionately argued case for radical change . One would have to go all the way back to the general election of 1993 : to the Alliance 's left-wing manifesto ( which attracted 18.3 percent of the popular vote ) to hear a political party ask for the electorate 's help in upending the status-quo . <p> It is difficult to understand the Left 's reticence on matters of policy . Certainly the Labour Party 's history argues strongly in favour of implementing radical change without apology and defending the gains made against all comers . After governing for 14 years , Labour had the satisfaction of losing power to a National Party which had only become electorally competitive by pledging to keep the core economic and social reforms of the First Labour Government in place . <p> It is possible to argue that Labour repeated that feat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rally its supporters against the Lange Government 's " more market " reforms in 1987 , the National Party embraced with frightening enthusiasm in the days and weeks immediately following the 1990 general election . <p> To make this case , however , it is necessary to argue that Labour found it impossible to grasp the ideological and electoral implications of National 's wholesale conversion to Neoliberalism . Following the Mother of All Budgets and the Employment Contracts Act , Labour 's continued adherence to the core elements of the neoliberal economic order left it stranded in exactly the same position as National between 1950 and 1984 . By refusing to abandon Rogernomics , Labour began its long , slow decline into an attenuated version of its principal electoral rival . A party equally committed to maintaining the neoliberal status quo . National Lite . <p> All attempts by Labour 's rank-and-file membership -- especially following the Alliance 's demise in 2002 -- to put an end the Parliamentary Labour Party 's love affair with neoliberalism ended in failure . The enthusiastic Rogernome , Phil Goff , was not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him by the likes of Helen Kelly , Marion Hobbs and Michael Wood . Labour 's dismal Party Vote of 2011 -- just 28 percent -- was taken by the Labour Right as proof that stepping away from the status-quo could only end in disaster . <p> TDB Recommends NewzEngine.com <p> Undaunted , the Labour Left continued to agitate for a final repudiation of neoliberalism , even managing to elect the only mildly apostatic David Cunliffe as the Party 's leader . Outraged at this rank insubordination , a majority of the Parliamentary Labour Party -- spearheaded by MPs who are now senior Cabinet Ministers -- made it clear that Cunliffe 's support within the Caucus was weak , vulnerable and unequal -- intellectually , emotionally and politically -- to the task it had set itself . Perhaps unsurprisingly , in the 2014 general election Labour crashed to an even worse defeat -- just 25 percent of the Party Vote . <p> The Party was now in the unenviable position of being unable to go either forward or back . With a clear majority of Labour MPs vehemently opposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conducting a ruthless purge of all those who had promoted and supported Cunliffe , the leadership of Andrew Little was characterised by a steady retreat from the progressive economic policy positions won between 2008 and 2011 . Unsurprisingly , that retreat was matched by a relentless decline in the voting public 's enthusiasm . Had Jacinda Ardern not stepped into the breach , it is likely that Labour 's Party Vote would have continued to decline -- quite possibly into the teens . <p> Ardern 's great achievement in the 2017 general election was to allow her own natural ebullience and rhetorical energy to generate an impression of political rejuvenation . Though she never actually said as much , " Jacinda " did not go out of her way to correct the widespread misconception that Labour had , finally , freed itself from ideological captivity . When she said " Let 's do this ! " , a great many people construed her words to mean : " Let 's move beyond Rogernomics ! " <p> Certainly , Winston Peters and NZ First understood the public 's eagerness for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up was he in the currents of history that the old campaigner felt moved to have a crack at capitalism itself -- a rhetorical blast half-heartedly echoed by Ardern . <p> But " kindness " and social-democracy , although closely related , are not identical twins . Had Covid-19 not intervened , the growing gap between the Ardern government 's rhetoric and its performance would almost certainly have seen it thrown out in 2020 . As it was , the country enthusiastically rewarded " Jacinda " for six astonishing months of political heroism . She had faced down the let-it-rippers of the corporate Right and welded the " Team of Five Million " into a remarkable political community . Only someone very special can deliver Ilam and Rangitata to the Labour Party ! <p> But , even with an absolute parliamentary majority , a move away from neoliberalism has proved to be beyond the Parliamentary Labour Party 's imagination . The sixth Labour government 's radicalism on matters relating to ethnicity and gender has not been echoed on those relating to taxation , government regulation , poverty and housing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government can not seem to get it right . <p> Always , gnawing away at its confidence and empathy , is the dictum that seriously challenging the economic and social status-quo is the surest route to electoral death . Labour 's colouring-in book , and National 's , have to look the same . All that matters is which party is better at staying inside the lines . <p> And so , we can only imagine a Labour Government willing and able to take the fight to Christopher Luxon and his largely talentless caucus . We can only dream of a Prime Minister with the steel to call out Luxon for inviting George Osborne to address his caucus . Saying something like this : <p> " After all , what is Osborne famous for ?

@@90678236 <p> Crime is becoming a key debate between Labour and National . This week they are both keen to show that they are tough on law and order . <p> It 's an issue that National has a traditional advantage on , and is one that they 're currently getting good traction from . In response , Labour is keen to counter this by also posing as tough on crime . <p> Politicians are all responding to public concerns about law and order . The issue of crime is rocketing up the political agenda , especially with so much reporting on ram-raids and gang activity . Recent polling shows that concern over crime is much higher than over other big issues such as climate change , tax and immigration . <p> Not only is Labour worried by the traction National is getting on crime , but they are clearly spooked by last week 's Newshub poll . Not only did it show that National was ahead of Labour , but also that a huge majority ( 68 per cent ) think Police Minister Poto Williams is too soft on crime . Only a small minority ( 18 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Labour supporters are unimpressed with Williams . <p> Unsurprisingly , the Government has fought back by going conservative on the issue themselves . Yesterday 's announcement shows just how desperate the Government is to fight back by spending huge amounts . They committed over half a billion dollars of extra funding for policing , crime , and prisons to be delivered in the Budget . <p> This announcement was clearly brought forward from Budget day to stave off the popular attacks from the right . It 's likely to be successful in assuaging some concern that Labour is n't on top of law and order . But it also looks somewhat panicked , rather than authentic , which means that it will be less effective than the Government want . Furthermore , some more liberal supporters of the Government will be less enthused about Labour 's new priorities . <p> Can Labour be more hard-line than National ? <p> Labour can now claim to be more hard-line than National in many ways . In terms of police numbers , Labour has become much more pro-police than National . Not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have also adopted a new policy that will ensure police employment numbers keep growing fast by tying the ratio of funded police officers to the population . The promised ratio will be one officer to every 480 New Zealanders . <p> It 's worth noting that under National the figure was about 550 , and Labour has got it down to about 500 . So , the direction of travel makes Labour the new " party of the police " . And illustrative of this , the Police Association seem to be over the moon about the announcement . <p> TDB Recommends NewzEngine.com <p> Labour also claims that by the end of the year they will have employed the promised extra 1800 police officers , and that this is six months ahead of schedule . This seems to be about the one area in which Labour is exceeding their promises rather than going backwards . <p> Sophistication required in combating crime <p> It 's to be expected that Labour and National are acting tough on law and order -- especially given that there is a definite perception of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in lieu of actually dealing with crime at its source , which exists in portfolios outside Police and Corrections . <p> The current " spike in crime " that New Zealand is experiencing -- and which the Government denies is a " trend " -- is related to more than just policing . In particular , they need to look at the impact of the last two years of Covid , and of worsening inequality and poverty in pushing people into anti-social behaviour . <p> The under-investment of a succession of governments in deprived communities has resulted in a propensity toward crime . And the massive transfer of wealth to the rich under the current government , along with its failure to protect the poor , means we might expect crime and other social problems to continue to get worse . In particular , the Government needs to deliver solutions for the cost of living crisis , especially for those at the bottom of society . <p> We need quality debate on law and order <p> In yesterday 's crime-fighting announcement , prominence was given to Government plans to combat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example of politicians posing as tough on crime without having done the research , just so they could assuage concerns . <p> The vague announcements on ram raids received this comment from Herald political editor Claire Trevett : " The trouble was it transpired the ram raids plan did not yet have any funding attached to it , not was there a plan yet -- it was simply an intention . Ministers had had a meeting and would be having another one . They would also consult with businesses about it . " Trevett explained that it was a case of Ministers needing " to be seen to be doing something " , but she concluded that " it might have been better to wait until it was more than half-baked . " <p> This example illustrates how easily politicians can treat crime issues with knee jerk responses . We need much more than this . We certainly need some quality and informed debate on the issues involved -- especially as things are probably going to get worse . <p> Given increasing concerns about gang violence , we are also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police . Even today , it 's been reported that iwi leader Paora Stanley ( chief executive of Ngai Te Rangi ) favours arming the police . He added : " I know a lot of cops . They are hard-working , bloody good Kiwis . There 's no doubt in my mind " . <p> Labour also needs to be more honest about the extent of the problem . At the moment , attempts to downplay the gangs and violence do a disservice to the necessary debate . Denying reality is not a smart response to the perception that Labour is falling victim to the wedge politics of National and Act . They need to create their own answers that confront the problem , without simply giving in to a " me too " approach . Perhaps it should give Labour pause for thought that their announcement has received a stamp of endorsement from conservative ex-MP Simon Bridges . <p> In the end , using tough policies and announcements of more police has to be more than just " damage control " by incumbents , and the pressure from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too serious to be treated as a competition of toughness . <p> Launched on Friday 1 March , 2013 , the ' TheDailyBlog.co.nz ' unites New Zealand 's leading left/centre-left commentators and progressive opinion shapers to provide the other side of the story on today 's news , media and political agendas.

Normally , change sneaks up on us . " <p> One of the biggest shifts had been concerning climate . When she first started , even a conversation about whether boards should have climate on the agenda was " very much on-the-edge " thinking . Now it was one of the main items . <p> Ms Patterson recently did a review of 19 vacancies advertised on a recruitment website and four were asking for climate competency as a key skill . Five years ago , that would never have happened , she said . <p> It was well established now that directors needed to be focused about climate .

Plus she had installed a stand-up desk at home . <p> During the pandemic , there was recognition of how valued and important the country 's critical workers were . <p> While she was " tucked up cosily at home " , her husband had the heartbreaking task of dealing with bereaved families amid the pandemic 's rules . <p> " It 's important we remember a lot of the sacrifices that have been made along the way , " she said . <p> Asked how IoD fared through Covid-19 , Ms Patterson said the organisation was fortunate to have both a great board and great people who helped guide it through the challenges -- and a lot of its work could be done from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running courses and events , which it had been unable to do , so it was about ensuring it was getting support and content to the director community .

Staff also took pay cuts which were repaid in time . Also , on top of the global pandemic was the uncertainty of market conditions . <p> Plus , there was the need to care for IoD 's people , keeping them safe and doing all that from a distance . Many were working from the kitchen table in their homes , while also caring for children . <p> But it had not been all bad ; the pandemic had taught people a lot , particularly about keeping talent and people strongly in focus . <p> It was a reminder of the importance of supplier networks , and the recognition of " a little bit of resilience " in systems , supply , reserves and people was incredibly important . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitter as a result . <p> At the moment , areas IoD was focused on included Chapter Zero ; IoD was hosting Chapter Zero New Zealand , the national chapter of the Climate Governance Initiative . <p> There was a lot of information out there and it could be very overwhelming . IoD was making that available to the whole director community , not just IoD members . <p> Talent was an area that boards were very focused on , including how closing borders had affected talent . <p> Cybersecurity and health and safety were also " absolutely critical " and then there was conversation about board character ; boards were leading the tone from the top , in terms of the culture of organisations . There was also recognition among the director community about upskilling more to understand and engage with Maori . <p> A strong advocate of diversity , Ms Patterson was a founding member of Global Women 's " Champions for Change " , a group of senior executives and directors who commit to diversity in the workplace , and a founding member of WiSPA , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement with diversity on boards ; while it might get measured on the basis of NZX-listed companies , because that information was publicly available , there was " huge " diversity in the not-for-profit sector . <p> IoD 's Mentoring for Diversity programme had been going for a long time and the organisation also had a Future Directors programme which aimed to develop the next generation of directors . <p> IoD 's membership was becoming increasingly diverse and the age demographic was also changing on boards . Boards were also looking for regional diversity , seeking representation outside of Auckland and Wellington for national roles . <p> Ms Patterson was still personally involved in governance ; she previously served as chairwoman for the Wellington Homeless Women 's Trust , a small charity which did " amazing work " . <p> She is on the board of Voices for Hope , a youth mental health charity which was co-founded by Jazz Thornton who was appearing in the latest series of Dancing With the Stars , chairs an advisory board at Victoria University with regards to ethics committees , and is on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ms Patterson got a lot of inquiries from people wanting to get involved in governance and wondering where they should start . <p> Starting in a not-for-profit , it was important to be involved in something they were passionate about , she said . <p> For it would involve nights , weekends , take you away from family and your work . And they were also not just there for the mechanics of governance ; it was about connections and understanding the " why " of the organisation -- " that 's where the magic happens " . <p> Governance was often talked about being a team sport -- the board came together and worked as a team -- but directors were individual athletes and with that , came individual liability , so it needed to be thought through carefully . <p> People should not seek to go on a board if they did not like reading ; while boardrooms might appear to be the hub of governance , hours were spent at home reading , and people had to be able to consume large portions information . <p> Being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " not just an adjunct or add-on " to something to do , or to look good on a CV , it was an active role . <p> But it was also incredibly rewarding for people if , like Ms Patterson , they were interested in what was happening in different businesses and what the various challenges were .

" <p> Thompson said Russian President Vladimir Putin believed the Western European countries would be very constrained in the way they could react to Russia 's actions in Ukraine , due to their dependence on Russian oil and gas . <p> Russia is about to cut off gas supplies to Finland on the basis it is seeking to join NATO and Thompson said this is further evidence that Putin regards gas in particular as " a geo-political weapon " . <p> " He regards it as the most important , in some sense instrument of power that Russia possesses . " <p> The issues surrounding energy situation today can be traced back to the 1970s oil crisis and more recently 2005 , Thompson said . <p> The Orange Revolution occurred in Ukraine in 2005 when a president was elected who wanted to move the country away from Russia and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that did not happen , she said . <p> " I think we can see a serious deterioration in relations between Russia and Ukraine thereafter . " <p> Thompson said it was also in 2005 that the German and Russian governments agreed to build the Nord Stream pipeline under the Baltic Sea , " the first of them that bypasses the transit of gas from Ukraine " . <p> The world 's production of oil also stagnated in 2005 , she said . <p> " It 's also true I think that by 2005 you can see Russia and China moving closer together and it was the year in Europe in which the French and the Dutch both rejected the European Union 's constitution treaty . " <p> In 2014 , the European Union worked with the then Ukrainian government to provide it with associate membership of the EU , but Russia " was deeply unhappy about that prospect " . <p> Thompson said it was naive to believe that Ukraine could be brought closer to the EU without having a security guarantee from NATO . <p> " To try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security guarantee seemed to me to be likely to produce the kind of Russian response that we saw in annexing Crimea in that year . " <p> Thompson said although the French and German governments were prepared to work towards Ukraine 's associate membership of the EU , they both vetoed Ukraine 's membership of NATO . <h> ' Turkey 's indispensable ' <p> Turkey has a crucial position in NATO due to its position on the southern coast of the Black Sea and it provides a geographical link between Europe and the Middle East , Thompson said . <p> But she said Turkey has repeatedly been rebuffed from joining the EU . <p> The French , and President Emmanuel Macron in particular , have been uncomfortable about Turkey being a NATO member , she said . <p> " But if you look at a map and you look at where Turkey is and what NATO needs to do in relation to defending states against Russia , including supplying weapons to Ukraine , it not being a NATO member but receiving lots of NATO support at the moment , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set of grievances , she said , including about the Kurds and the support that some European governments including Finland and Sweden give to Kurdish positions . <p> " It would like the focus of NATO to be more compatible with Turkish geo-political objectives , particularly in relation perhaps to the East Mediterranean . " <p> Thompson said Turkey is in a position where it can ask for some of its grievances to be addressed in exchange for acquiescence . <p> She said it shows how difficult it is for NATO to remain united about big issues for any length of time . <h> Geo-political faultlines around energy will continue <p> An increase in renewable energy has led to an overall increase in energy consumption , rather than it replacing fossil fuels , Thompson said . <p> She said there are a number of countries where the proportion of renewable energy in their electricity mix is significantly higher than it was a few decades ago . <p> " But by contrast if you look at something like transportation , we 're pretty much where we were where the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as China and India have been engaged in increased oil and gas consumption as their economies grow . <p> But she said China has considerable advantages in terms of green energy . <p> China is in a strong position in terms of electric vehicles , it dominates metal extraction , it is responsible for a higher proportion of solar panel manufacture , she said . <p> She said energy has always been and will continue to be geo-political . <p> " I think that it 's quite probable that in the end geo-political competition around metal extraction will be somewhat different than geo-political competition around oil and gas partly because the metals are not as arbitrarily distributed around the world as oil and gas have been . " <p> Thompson said given that we will be living with multiple energy sources - both green and fossil fuels - for some time the old geo-political fault lines around energy will remain , but there will also be new geo-political faultlines around green energy .

The third solo album from the former One Direction member -- and actor , heartthrob , and international style icon -- will sell by the truckload . And so it should : Harry 's House is a party album with a heart , and precisely the kind of record that the world needs right now . <p> The difference between Harry 's House and its predecessor , 2019 's Fine Line , is immediately clear . While that album revelled in the classic rock sounds of the seventies , the new one is firmly rooted in the eighties . Wham ! and Prince influences can be found everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and arenas , which is lucky , since the 28-year-old is in the middle of a gargantuan tour that takes in two nights at Wembley Stadium next month . <p> He sets out his stall unequivocally on opening track Music for a Sushi Restaurant , a full-on funk-pop workout . There are flicks of the tom-tom drum sound from Michael Jackson 's The Way You Make Me Feel , bursts of When Doves Cry-like electric guitar , and horns that could have come straight from Wham ! ' s Young Guns or Wham Rap . <p> The synth in the intro of Daylight brings to mind George Michael 's A Different Corner while the mid-tempo Grapejuice sounds like late-seventies Paul McCartney . But , working with long-time collaborators Kid Harpoon and Tyler Johnson , Styles has given these sounds a modern sheen . <p> So what if single As It Was bears a passing resemblance to A-ha 's Take On Me , as has been widely noted ? These influences are largely moot anyway : many of Styles ' fans were n't even born the first time around . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its face . And it is accompanied by clever and compassionate lyrics . They are intimate in numerous senses of the word . Styles is often overtly sexy ( in Daylight he sings about the listener being a spoon dipped in honey so he can stick to her ) but he is also personal . <p> Perhaps aware that he 's a widely-adored multimillionaire rock star , Styles goes to great lengths to break down perceived barriers : both geographical and lifestyle . On Late Night Talking he sings about following his lover " to any place -- if it 's Hollywood or Bishopsgate . " <p> In Little Freak he says he 's not worried about where his lover is , he just wants them to know that he 's thinking about them . The songs revel in tiny details : pancakes for breakfast , bike rides , tea , toast and spilt beer . <p> The sole instance where Styles fully returns to the sixties and seventies is on penultimate track Boyfriends , which has an acoustic guitar riff and multi-tracked vocals that echo Simon &amp; Garfunkel 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Landslide ) . <p> Again , Styles circumvents obstacles to sing directly to the listener ( " Boyfriends/ They think you 're so easy/ They take you for granted .

Romance over distance is unfortunate , he says . But -- hey -- they 're just coordinates . He 'll find you . <p> And this is Styles ' great trick with Harry 's House . Despite his fame and riches , despite his unattainability , and despite the mammoth tour that will see him play to hundreds of thousands of fans , he communicates as though there 's only one listener . <p> And he does this in a big-hearted and tactile way .

Attendance for party heads was n't mandatory . <p> The State Council , which is overseen by Li , did n't immediately respond to faxed questions . <p> While Li did n't criticize the Covid Zero policy or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " frustration with the slow pace in which local governments were enacting stimulus measures passed in recent months , according to Trey McArver , co-founder of research firm Trivium China . <p> " He is being put in the impossible position of trying to rescue the economy without being able to adjust the one policy -- zero-Covid -- that is causing the most economic damage , " McArver said , referring to Li . <p> The stakes are especially high as the Chinese Communist Party prepares to hold a twice-a-decade leadership conclave later this year , where Xi is expected to win a landmark third term . The top party ranks will also be reshuffled , clearing the way for other cadres to move up the ladder if they can avoid any missteps , particularly in handling Covid outbreaks . <p> The paralysis is reflected in market sentiment . The benchmark CSI 300 Index remained flat after sliding as much as 1.1% on Wednesday , while shares in Hong Kong declined . <p> Li 's meeting on Wednesday brought together cadres right down to the county level , featuring officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and utilities , according to notices on county-level government websites . <p> The premier used that platform to deliver his starkest warnings about the economy 's weak performance , saying " difficulties in some aspects , to a certain extent , are greater than when the epidemic hit us severely in 2020 . " He said China must avoid a contraction in the second quarter , adding that the nation would pay a huge price with a long road to recovery if the economy ca n't keep expanding at a certain rate . <p> Deep Slump <p> At a separate event , Li also urged local officials to ensure a bumper harvest for the summer crop to meet annual grain production targets and stabilize prices , China National Radio reported on Thursday . <p> The latest official data showed a contraction in industrial output for the first time since 2020 and a jump in the surveyed jobless rate to 6.1% in April , close to a record . High-frequency data for May showed the economy remained in a deep slump , according to Bloomberg 's aggregate index of eight indicators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China 's economic struggle in recent weeks , though his more generic comments have received prominent treatment in state-run newspapers . " China 's resolve to open up at a high standard will not change and the door of China will open still wider to the world , " Xi said at a recent trade council anniversary meeting , in a typical comment . <p> Li , by contrast , has emerged as a more candid figure . At the same trade council event in Beijing earlier this month Joerg Wuttke , president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China , said the premier " woke up " when some delegates shared their frustrations over China 's Covid policy . <p> " Li came over afterward and asked us how we were doing and how was business , " Wuttke said , adding that he was surprised by the move . " It was a very positive gesture . His actual crossing the street , showing up and saying ' let 's chat ' was impressive . " <p> ' A Lot of Fluff ' <p> Wuttke said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and no opportunity for a back and forth . <p> Xi has sought to maintain a Covid-Zero policy while targeting 5.5% GDP growth this year -- a goal that has put local officials under strain . Economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast the economy will grow 4.5% this year . <p> Bank managers at several state-owned lenders have been told they will be held accountable for failing to meet loan issuance targets . They have struggled to implement orders to introduce more liquidity , as companies that meet requirements are reluctant to borrow given the uncertain outlook of economy , according to banking business heads and executives . <p> Still , some analysts held out hope that the worst may be over soon . <p> " Premier Li 's speech yesterday was incredibly important in adjusting expectations to a more realistic position , " said James Sullivan , head of Asia Pacific equity research at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co .

@@91097236 <h> The U.S. Lawmakers Who Have Received the Most Funding from the NRA <p> In the wake of Tuesday 's mass shooting at a Texas elementary school -- in which a gunman killed 19 students , a teacher and another adult -- many lawmakers are calling for gun reform . <p> But even with hundreds of mass shootings taking place in the U.S. every year , Congress has repeatedly failed to pass any major piece of gun control legislation . <p> One of the most recent efforts to reform federal gun laws came in 2013 with the Manchin-Toomey amendment , a measure that would have required background checks on all commercial gun sales . The amendment -- which came to a vote four months after 20 first-graders and six educators were fatally shot at Sandy Hook Elementary School -- failed , getting only 54 of the 60 votes it needed to overcome a filibuster . <p> Most of the 46 senators who voted against the amendment expressed the opinion that it simply would n't work , with Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley telling reporters at the time : " Criminals do not submit to background checks now . They will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they also shared something else in common . According to the non-partisan campaign finance research group OpenSecrets , nearly all of the 46 senators who voted against the amendment had accepted significant campaign contributions from PACs associated with gun rights groups , including the National Rifle Association . <p> Since then , U.S. lawmakers have continued to rack up donations from gun rights groups -- some to the tune of tens of millions of dollars . <p> Even in the immediate wake of the shooting , many Republicans continue to throw their support behind the NRA . On Friday , just days after the Uvalde school shooting , Republicans including former President Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz are scheduled to headline a forum at the group 's annual meeting in Houston . <p> OpenSecrets maintains a list of the top recipients of NRA and gun rights groups funds , with data updates as recently as May 16 , 2022 . <p> It 's important to note that the NRA contributions on the OpenSecrets list are career totals , some going back as early as 1989 ( so lawmakers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NRA donations ) .

Mitt Romney <h> Sen. Mitt Romney , Utah Republican : $13,645,387 <p> What he 's received : $1,000 in direct support from the NRA and $3,278,632 in independent support . But the largest contributions to Romney came via NRA spending against his political opponents ( including Barack Obama , during the 2012 presidential race ) , to the tune of $10,369,044 . Speaking to The Washington Post , a Romney spokesperson said , " No one owns Senator Romney 's vote , as evidenced by his record of independence in the Senate .

@@91097237 <p> Have you been paying attention to shares of Marathon Petroleum ( MPC ) ? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 15% over the past month . The stock hit a new 52-week high of $98.95 in the previous session . Marathon Petroleum has gained 51.5% since the start of the year compared to the 34.2% move for the Zacks Oils-Energy sector and the 32.8% return for the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry . <p> What 's Driving the Outperformance ? <p> The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises , as it has n't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters . In its last earnings report on May 3 , 2022 , Marathon Petroleum reported EPS of $1.49 versus consensus estimate of $1.12 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 37.53% . <p> For the current fiscal year , Marathon Petroleum is expected to post earnings of $10.17 per share on $131.8 billion in revenues . This represents a 315.1% change in EPS on an 8.99% change in revenues . For the next fiscal year , the company is expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This represents a year-over-year change of -21.38% and -7.95% , respectively . <p> Valuation Metrics <p> Marathon Petroleum may be at a 52-week high right now , but what might the future hold for the stock ? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself . <p> On this front , we can look at the Zacks Style Scores , as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks ( beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security ) . These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value , Growth , and Momentum , while there is a combined VGM Score as well . Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style . <p> Marathon Petroleum has a Value Score of A. The stock 's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A , respectively , giving the company a VGM Score @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stock currently trades at 9.5X current fiscal year EPS estimates , which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 9.5X . On a trailing cash flow basis , the stock currently trades at 11.9X versus its peer group 's average of 9.7X . Additionally , the stock has a PEG ratio of 0.51 . This is n't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective . <p> Zacks Rank <p> We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock , as this supersedes any trend on the style score front . Fortunately , Marathon Petroleum currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 ( Buy ) thanks to rising earnings estimates . <p> Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 ( Strong Buy ) or 2 ( Buy ) and Style Scores of A or B , it looks as if Marathon Petroleum fits the bill . Thus , it seems as though Marathon Petroleum shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come . <p> How Does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MPC have been soaring , and the company still appears to be a decent choice , but what about the rest of the industry ? One industry peer that looks good is PBF Energy Inc . ( PBF ) . PBF has a Zacks Rank of # 1 ( Strong Buy ) and a Value Score of A , a Growth Score of A , and a Momentum Score of A. <p> Earnings were strong last quarter . PBF Energy Inc. beat our consensus estimate by 34.62% , and for the current fiscal year , PBF is expected to post earnings of $5.77 per share on revenue of $37.18 billion . <p> Shares of PBF Energy Inc. have gained 18.1% over the past month , and currently trade at a forward P/E of 5.28X and a P/CF of 20.18X . <p> The Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry is in the top 9% of all the industries we have in our universe , so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for MPC and PBF , even beyond their own solid fundamental situation . <p> Want the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days .

" <p> As a 12-year-old , Lim was inspired by Jamie Oliver , the so-called " Naked Chef " . Her own philosophy , she would explain to her mother as she sat up at the breakfast bar watching her cook , was " food in the nude " . Not , Lim hastens to add , cooking unclothed - but recipes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressed up in fancy packages and additives " . A large part of the MasterChef NZ allure , she admits , was the cookbook deal that came with the prize package ; a fast track to the nude-food ambition . <p> " I 'm very lucky and grateful for being able to do what I dreamed of much , much earlier than I anticipated . I imagined I 'd write my first cookbook when I 'd had kids and they 'd grown up . . . " <p> Post-MasterChef , Lim co-founded My Food Bag , became a brand in her own right and , most recently , bought and moved to a nearly 500ha farm in Central Otago with husband Carlos Bagrie and their two sons . She remains a My Food Bag ambassador - and a headline maker . <p> Simon Henry ? He 's the founder of DGL group , and the man who recently and inexplicably described Lim as a " little bit of Eurasian fluff " . His comments came after a photograph of Lim barbecuing a chicken was printed in a My Food Bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV celebrity showing off her sensuality " - and cleavage . Everyone from radio talkback callers to the Prime Minister waded in with their disgust while Lim , who initially declined interviews , told the New Zealand Herald " leaders should use their influence to celebrate diversity " . Meanwhile , Henry 's company share prices took a dive , his board announced a cultural review and he , eventually , emailed an apology . <p> MasterChef put Lim in the spotlight , but she remembers feeling " horrendously terrified " when the reality television cooking competition first went to air . <h> Advertisement <p> " I had no idea what to expect or how I would come across . I loathed watching it . I have n't , to this day , watched the entire thing . Maybe it would be different now , but in the past , the emotion has still felt quite raw . You feel suddenly thrown back into that state . I remember how I felt and it was terrifying . I was quite a timid thing . I was 24 , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old self dealing with Henry 's comments ? <p> " No . I ca n't actually . I think she would have crumbled .

It 's 7.30pm and her sons are just finishing dinner . Her newest book Yum ! has just hit the shelves - it focuses on family nutrition , from newborns up . What 's on her own family menu tonight ? <p> " The boys are eating lemon souffle pudding . I could n't be bothered doing dinner tonight , so I went straight to dessert , which they were very happy about . . . my biggest piece of advice , if anyone is asking , is not to stress about it too much . Pudding for dinner some nights is absolutely fine . Do n't worry about it whatsoever !

Lemons are one thing , along with citrus , avocados , bananas and milk , that I still buy . " <p> The Herald on Sunday has asked Lim to ' fess up . To dish the dirt on what it 's really like to uproot your city life and reinvent yourself in the country . Once , she lived in a loft apartment above Parnell 's Cibo restaurant . Now , she ca n't buy takeaways without a drive and some forward planning . Lim says ( family aside ) there 's not much she misses about her old life . <p> " I 'm one of those people who could quite easily become a recluse . I do n't need to see humans . I could easily potter away for months and months without seeing a single human other than my immediate family and it would n't bother me one bit . " <p> Farming is not a 9-5 occupation .

You see pictures of someone in their vegetable garden , wandering around and gathering stuff for dinner . That picture does not tell the rest of the story . I do n't want to sound like a spoiled brat by saying that it 's stressful , but it 's not exactly relaxing . <p> " It 's actually quite full-on , the pressure to harvest things on time .

Yesterday , we had people over and instead of giving them tea or coffee , I juiced 30 apples and made an apple cinnamon hot toddy thing , because I 'm trying to get rid of all the apples . " <p> Is n't that a good problem to have ? <p> " True . But you ca n't control when you have it . In two months , we wo n't have any apples and then we wo n't be able to eat them again for eight months , because I 'm not going to go and buy any . No way . " <p> Lim 's home vegetable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the farm has been set aside for a commercial market garden but , so far , only 1.5ha has been planted . <p> " And I think , based on how it 's going at the moment , we 're going to stop right there ! The truth is , we 're basically subsidising the Wakatipu Basin with really delicious , organically grown vegetables . I have n't figured out how to actually make it profitable ! " <p> The garden supplies around 40 local restaurants and cafes , but the learning curve has been steep . Thousands of garlic bulbs were overrun by couch grass . Tomatoes went into the glasshouse six weeks too late and had to be harvested green to beat the cold and the shortened , southern growing season . On the plus side , says Lim , the freezing temperatures tend to kill insect pests . The couple also appear to be finally getting on top of a resident rabbit population - now , if Carlos heads out to hunt for dinner , it can take up to an hour to find one . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convenience and control , " says Lim . " When we lived in Auckland , we got My Food Bag delivered , or you could pop out to the shops and get something when you felt like it and very quickly . Down here , it 's the complete opposite . Nature dictates when you 're going to have it and how much you are going to have . There is n't any consistency . You just have to work with what you 've got . " <p> And if someone demanded she relocate back to Auckland tomorrow ? " I 'd ask them why . God forbid , if Mum or someone was sick , then , of course , I would move there in a heartbeat , but other than that , I ca n't see any other reason why . And I do n't think I could . " <p> Lim says her senses are now attuned to country life . <p> " When we first moved , it was so eerily quiet . No neighbours and it 's pitch black outside at night . No street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All you hear is a creepy possum in one of the fruit trees or scattering across your roof and that freaks you out .

I think nothing of walking in the dark and suddenly seeing a possum 's eyes flash up . I do n't think anything of hearing rats or mice in the walls . It 's normal . " <p> Celebrity chef Nadia Lim and her pet goat Milly . Photo/Supplied <p> Lim and Carlos Bagrie met at Otago University . From the beginning , she says he made it clear that if they stayed together , one day they 'd live on a farm . <p> " He 's from an unbroken line of farmers . He 's the only one who broke the line , and now he 's put it back together . I did n't necessarily want to be on a big farm , I would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to do the proper farming thing . <p> " And I always felt , more so probably in the past five years , this overwhelming sense of responsibility to not only be part of the process of preparing food - teaching people how to cook and use these ingredients - but to also be part of the process of how the ingredients get to your plate . How you grow your food , how you raise it . . . I want to complete the full cycle . " <p> The biggest lesson from her life shift , she says , is that there is no single " right " way to farm . <p> " There is no black and white . I do n't buy into the idea of people saying farmers should do things this way , or that way . There are far too many variables and there are pros and cons to all systems , whether they be conventional or organic or spray-free or regenerative . <p> " People watch documentaries or read an article , and of course humans like things to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put my heart on the line and tell you it 's not . " <p> Recently , Lim was stopped by a family of fans at a cafe in Arrowtown . They asked about her shift to farming and were delighted when she told them the traditional sheep - and barley-producing land now ran less stock and grew more crops . <p> " The father said ' my daughter will be so pleased , she 's a real environmentalist and she 's a vegan ' . And I said , ' I hate to break it to you , but it 's not that simple ' . " <p> Long story short , says Lim : " When it comes to growing food , to me it is the most simple , natural thing in the world - there is no such thing as an ecosystem that does not have plants AND animals in it . It 's not as simple as ' livestock bad , plant good ' . It comes down to who is helping curate the balance of the two . " <p> From contestant to judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circle .

I do n't know if there is a lot of that around these days or if people really care for it ? I think maybe we 've become more simple in our approach to food ? That 's definitely the case for myself .

The media meet-and-greets , the hair and makeup photoshoots were 1600km away from her Swanndri-clad life where her constant companion is now a goat called Milly .

@@91135230 <h> BusinessMay 28 , 2022 <h> ' Disneyland of the Pacific ' : The rise and fall of West Auckland 's Footrot Flats Fun Park <p> The gates at Footrot Flats Fun Park were open for a good time , not a long time . ( Image : Archi Banal ) <p> A West Auckland theme park had big ambitions but did n't last the distance . Chris Schulz asks former staff members what became of the fun park that was meant to be ' bigger than Rainbow 's End ' . <p> From her rundown office , Karen Crossley could hear lions roar . Thanks to budget cuts , the pride of up to eight had n't been fed , and they made a particular noise that sent a shiver down her spine . Throughout the day , their cries for food intensified , becoming louder , hangrier . No one was ever hurt , but sometimes a lion would escape through a fence in search of food , forcing staff to lock themselves inside until it was caught . Other times , rangers would drive jeeps into the lion enclosure that would then break down . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , waiting to be rescued . <p> As office manager , Crossley was in charge of fixing all of that , but not having enough money for horse meat , the lions ' favourite food , was n't the only issue on her mind . By late 1988 , she had been employed for most of her adult life at the West Auckland theme park , founded on sprawling grass fields in Te Atatu Peninsula just a short drive from the northwestern motorway . From every vantage point , you could see the water 's edge , the sun glinting off the harbour , the bridge shimmering in the distance . " It was marvellous , " says one former staff member of the view . <p> Things were n't quite so sunny behind the scenes . By then , the park had been through several iterations -- opening as Leisureland in the early 80s , morphing into Footrot Flats Fun Park around 1984 , then winding down into Something Different Fun Park after the global financial crisis curbed spending habits . Crossley had seen it all , from its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winding down the street , hoping for a chance to spend the day on rollercoasters , gondolas , go-karts and bungee jumps , making memories that would last them a lifetime . <p> Now , the park was well past its peak . Lack of income meant the power kept getting turned off . Security had been cut back and overnight break-ins happened often . Yet the park remained open seven days a week , closing only for Christmas Day . Its busiest days were weekends and school holidays , and Crossley would carry the day 's takings to the bank on her own , a daunting proposition on the mean streets of Te Atatu North , then a notoriously rugged suburb . If anyone confronted her , she had a plan : hand over the money and run . <p> Image : Archi Banal <p> Every day delivered Crossley new problems to deal with . Recently , a circus had moved on site to join the theme park rides , and the animals were troubled . Jose the baboon caught and beheaded sparrows to eat , sending parents and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bubba the chimpanzee did n't receive his daily ice cream treat , he 'd lash out . He once socked a keeper straight in the face . A rogue camel escaped into the warm asphalt carpark and charged at guests trying to park their cars . When Crossley attempted to intervene , the camel set its sights on her , sending her running , screaming . <p> She 'd already been battered by a ram , attacked by a turkey , rescued peacocks running down the main street , and spent all day having obscenities yelled at her . After a stint in the park 's bar , two cockatoos had been taught how to swear , and were no longer considered appropriate for public appearances . Crossley would hear " Fuck you , fuckwit ! " being parroted from the rafters in her office as she attempted to balance the books . <p> One day , she was visited by a neighbour who believed the park 's cute donkey that took kids for rides had been butchered in their driveway . It was n't a donkey -- it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought a dead donkey was entirely possible . By now , the park was in disarray , and nothing could surprise her . Eventually and with no warning , after nearly a decade in operation , the park , which had operated under three names , and saw tens of thousands of people enjoy its facilities , shut its gates for the final time . <p> It was n't supposed to be like this . Crossley had signed up to work at a theme park with big dreams . It was supposed to become the " Disneyland of the Pacific " , a theme park designed to stand the test of time , to grow in size , compete with and dominate Rainbow 's End . She 'd been there throughout the 80s , watching it become a destination for a generation of kids growing up around New Zealand . Every school holidays , they 'd come out to the West Auckland park to visit Driver 's Town , where they could earn their first " driver 's licence " , jump off New Zealand 's first bungee jump , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spend all day playing laser tag , video games and mini-golf . To refuel they 'd head to Rangi 's , a takeaway bar known for its cheeseburgers and thick shakes . <p> But , by the beginning of 1989 , the park was in its dying days . The 1987 stock market crash had changed habits . Money was n't readily available , and if it was , no one was spending it at theme parks . The council demanded more in rent and rates . Bringing in the animals from Massey 's nearby Lion Safari Park , and joining forces with a circus , were last-ditch efforts to save the park . It was n't working . " People were n't coming , " says Crossley . " They did n't like seeing lions in cages . " Instead , she worked seven days a week , plugging holes , sorting out issues , capturing escaped animals , trying to find money to pay the bills , hoping things would come right . It was thankless work . It never ended . <p> Many years later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sipping tea and whispering " oh my God " to herself every time another memory comes to her . Now employed at a West Auckland supermarket filling online orders , she still ca n't believe a lot of the things she experienced , things that happened in front of her own eyes . For one thing , it was never supposed to go full Tiger King . But there she was , living " a nightmare " every day . " I did n't have time to eat , " Crossley says . " There was never a dull moment . " <p> ' We built the rollercoaster , " remembers Philip Wilkinson . " I was in fifth form . " In the early 1980s , Wilkinson was in school when he found himself a part-time job that made him the envy of his friends . He spent his weekends working at Leisureland , the brand new theme park everyone was talking about . It had bumper boats , a video game parlour , a restaurant , a souvenir shop and a tuck shop called Aunt Dolly 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Wilkinson , who still remembers the competition between the city 's competing theme parks . " Rainbow 's End was around , but we were much bigger than Rainbow 's End . " <p> Riders on the Cannonball Run could pose for photos after taking the ride . ( Photo : Supplied ; additional design Archi Banal ) <p> There was a good reason for that . Driver 's Town was Leisureland 's main attraction : a network of concrete roads where kids could sit written and verbal tests , get their very own " driver 's licence " , then head out and drive small , purpose-built cars around the tracks . " You 'd get ... a written and a verbal test , " he says . " People had to prove they could drive properly around the track before they were given their licence . " Made out of cardboard , with their photo stuck to it , kids carried these with them like a badge of honour . <p> When he finished school , Wilkinson drifted away from the park , but it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , unionised workforces meant park staff received time-and-a-half on Saturdays and double-time on Sundays -- much more than his teacher 's salary . " We were being paid astronomic wages , " he says . " Teachers earned $20,000 a year , I was getting $30,000 a year . " Soon enough , he packed in his teaching dreams and joined the park full-time , working his way through various departments before becoming operations manager . <p> The park was popular at weekends and during school holidays , but weekdays were tough . " Nobody was coming during the week , " says Wilkinson . " That was n't a good thing . " Then Dave Dobbyn released a song that changed everything . ' Slice of Heaven ' was the lead single from the soundtrack for Footrot Flats : The Dog 's Tale , a 1984 film celebrating Wal , Dog and Horse , the characters from Murray Ball 's popular newspaper comic strip . It became a No. 1 Australasian hit , the movie topped the box office , and park management signed a deal with Ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It spurred a new run of success . Suddenly , the park became the place to go . Actors dressed as Wal , Dog and Horse the cat mingled with customers . The carpark would be full , with queues down the street full of people waiting to get in . Its popularity meant an influx of cash , leading to the addition of new rides . A rollercoaster , the Cannonball Run , was built . A laser tag course morphed into a paintball challenge . Go-karts , kayak rides , mini-golf , BMX tracks , train rides , gondola rides and even helicopter trips made appearances at the park . <p> Famous faces began showing up . Murray Ball was a regular . So were members of When the Cat 's Away , the ' Melting Pot ' singers who performed concerts at the park . Mickey and Minnie Mouse showed up , on loan from Disney . " Tim Shadbolt used to come in all the time with his mayoral chains on and drive on the train , " says Crossley . " That 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular target for thieves trying to steal tickets . Wilkinson was at a party one night when a man holding a knife bellowed : " You threw me out of Footrot Flats and I 'm going to kill you . " Wilkinson 's first XV rugby mates helped bundle the offender out of the party . <p> A bungee jump was constructed , looking nothing like those in action around Aotearoa today . A complex network of scaffolding 22 metres high was erected near the water park . A newspaper report at the time called it " the world 's first commercial bungee jumping tower " . The few willing to give it a go would climb a series of wooden planks to the top , before being tied up with a bungee cord and instructed to jump towards an inflatable landing pad below them . <p> Photos taken at the time make the tower seem terrifyingly unstable . " Did he jump ? " is how an interview with the park 's marketing manager Gary Pring was headlined at the time . No , even he did n't give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climb up the damn thing , " says Pring . " You 'd hang on tight . " The attraction did n't prove to be as popular as park officials thought it would be , and it was removed . " It just did n't fire , to be quite honest , " says Pring . <p> The terrifying bungee attraction did n't deter thousands from heading out west . But in some cases , less was more . " It was bloody hard work , " says Wilkinson . " We hummed at 2,000 people ... 3,000 people was a problem . You ran out of food , you had people standing in queues for too long . We 'd send the entertainers out , but when it 's scorching hot , you could n't do that for too long . " Crossley remembers standing in her office alongside others trying to keep up with counting the stacks of money coming in through the ticket booths . " We had a big safe , " she says . " The money was in there . " Just before 5pm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all to the bank . <p> One incident has gone down in Footrot Flats Fun Park history . Staff working the rollercoaster let one carriage leave before the other had finished , causing an accident . " The second carriage ran into the back of the first carriage and lifted it off the tracks , " remembers Wilkinson . Passengers were stuck , and firefighters helped them get down . It made the 6pm news . " Everyone was going , ' Oh , this is dreadful , ' " says Crossley . Instead of being a deterrent , it boosted the park 's fortunes . " The next day was so busy it was n't funny . Everyone wanted to go on the rollercoaster . We could n't keep up with the amount of people that came to the park . " <p> Pring was living in a caravan onsite . He remembers it as the best time of his life . " I loved it , " he says . " It was just fantastic . I was doing live shows every day , out with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening stroll . " You 'd be looking towards the Auckland Harbour Bridge , saltwater flats . It was magnificent and peaceful . " Sometimes , he 'd come across intruders and chase them out of the park with a hammer . Aside from cheap rent , he had another reason for living at the park . " It was a great place to bring a hot date at night , " he says . " No one 's ever known this , but we 'd go on the bumper boats , and I 'd take the train around for a circuit . The neighbours must have wondered why it was going at eight or nine at night . " <p> Talk to fans of the park in the present day , and this is the time everyone remembers : an upbeat park packed with kids full of fun and adventures . " We had everything from boxing events , to sporting activities , to wild pig races , you name it , " says John St Clair Brown . He bought the park when it was called Leisureland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , attractions and activities was the only way to keep customers coming back , he says . " We had a cafe there with a bar , we had horses there . It was always humming as a place to go and have fun . " <p> So what happened ? Former staff say there are many reasons for the park 's demise . Wilkinson blames the constant stress of finding new ways to promote it . " Coming into Christmas or school holidays , you want a brand new attraction ready to go , " he says . " That 's ... $250,000 back then . " He also blames the 1987 stock market crash . " It struggled financially . No one had spare cash . " Then there was the final name change . " For fuck 's sake , who calls something ' Something Different Fun Park ? ' You 're doomed . " <p> Pring believes the park 's location was to blame . " In those days you were n't allowed signage on the motorway or anything like that , " he says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's right on the main drag , it 's easily accessible .

We did n't have a lot of budget ... the characters were gradually winding down , " he says . " There was talk of a second movie coming out that never eventuated . " <p> St Clair Brown blames the council for increasing rent and rates when the park could least afford it . He already owned Victoria Park Market and Mt Hutt ski field , and would soon buy Waiwera Hot Pools , another theme park with a controversial past . But his West Auckland theme park was the worst performer in his portfolio . He claims it never made him a profit . " We had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether to walk away , " he says . " We just gave up . We just closed it up . We could n't continue , really . It folded into the night . " <p> Crossley believes moving the animals in was the beginning of the end . They 'd come from Massey 's Lion Safari Park , and changed the park 's vibe completely . A gondola ride led visitors into the lion enclosure , legs dangling just out of reach . Along with the circus , it meant an elephant , chimpanzee , baboon , lions , tigers , a camel and many other animals were on display . " Things could have been done better , " she says . She did n't agree with the many changes being made , including the bar and boxing ring that led to drunks wandering around at dusk . " That was n't the idea of the park . I think it was a last attempt to save the place . " <p> One day she arrived to find the gates locked and a sign posted on the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exact date , but most believe it was the beginning of 1989 when the park closed for good .

Over a decade I was there . " She was headhunted to work at a furniture company , and remains a proud West Auckland resident . <p> Pring , meanwhile , received rights to use the Footrot Flats costumes and performed at malls and A&amp;P shows around the South Island for years afterwards . He 's stayed down there ever since . Wilkinson lives and works in West Auckland , just a few kilometres from the old theme park site , running a plastics company . He credits the park with teaching him everything he knows about business , and is left with lasting memories . " I ended up marrying the girl that played the Dog , " he says . ' Slice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always a fun story : ' I married the Dog from Footrot Flats . ' " <p> St Clair Brown is 76 now , lives in Whangaparaoa , and remains in business . His firm Coastal Cabins makes small , affordable houses and ships them around the North Island . He refuses to retire , instead preferring to keep busy after the death of his daughter from cancer in 2017 . " I was looking for a distraction , " he says . " I certainly got distracted , and still am . " He has n't remained friends with anyone from the park , and does n't have any photos on the wall , or mementos in storage . Ask him about the good times , all the happy memories customers have of the place , and he replies : " It was a pain in the ass . It was always nothing but trouble . " <p> Nothing is left of the park now . Te Atatu North has become Te Atatu Peninsula , a gentrified suburb full of parents pushing prams , single dwellings being turned into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the park 's site sit quiet family homes with the same views that park users used to enjoy .

Occasionally , links to Trade Me listings are posted for sales of old Driver 's Town cars , or photos posted of old menus from Rangi 's . On YouTube , just two videos are available .

No , this is n't some science-fiction food created from thin air , it 's where you 'll find New Zealand 's most remote burger bar . And the only way there is to cycle or walk for several hours . <p> BROOK SABIN/Stuff <p> You 'll find Burger Afloat on Lake Dunstan . <p> It 's a game of simple maths . The effort to get there outstrips the calories you 'll consume from the burger . So , in my world , that makes it a perfect guilt-free burger . <p> This remarkable eatery is called Burger Afloat , and you 'll find it on the Lake Dunstan Cycle Trail . The 55-kilometre cycle and walkway opened in May 2021 , and weaves along the cliffs of the Cromwell Gorge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other . <p> Aside from the breathtaking scenery , one of the attractions is a floating coffee shop that was established half-way along the trail , called Coffee Afloat . The business is run by locals Richard and Jolanda Foale , who ran a popular helicopter company in Cromwell before Covid-19 hit . <p> BROOK SABIN/Stuff <p> The award-winning , and delicious , venison burger . <p> The pair were both photography models for the opening of the trail , but realised one problem : the ride is three to four hours ( each way ) and there was nowhere anyone could get a refreshment , specifically the c-word : caffeine . <p> With nowhere to put a shop along the steep cliff-lined trail , they decided the only option was a floating coffee shop . It was an instant hit , and now has a rotating team of six baristas serving more than a hundred cyclists on busy days . <p> The pair have recently branched into a second floating eatery - called Burger Afloat . And as a keen burger lover , I could n't miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we arrived at the busiest place on the trail - the floating restaurants . I could instantly smell my taste buds were in for a treat . <p> BROOK SABIN/Stuff <p> Burger Afloat is a must stop spot on the Lake Dunstan trail . <p> The restaurant focuses on " smashed burgers , " where the patty is split in two , flattened and cooked separately . " We wo n't get too science-y on you , but that slight charred outer layer creates an incredible taste , flavour and scent that adds more flavour , " Jolanda explained . <p> Their flagship burger has Central Otago wild venison and thyme , with smoked bacon , Swiss cheese , pinot pickled onions and Central Otago apricot relish . And it was delicious , easily one of the best burgers I 've tried on home soil . <p> BROOK SABIN/Stuff <p> The burgers are smashed , for that extra charred goodness . <p> It 's a burger that would rival any of the best ones I 've tried in the big cities , and given its location , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each morning , then solar power is used for most of the electricity generation if the weather is fine . <p> There is also a vegetarian option , which tasted great -- but was no match for the venison . <p> And for those wondering if it 's really zero calorie ? Let 's dig down . Say the burger is roughly 700 calories . You burn around 400 to 750 calories an hour cycling , and it 's a three-hour trip one-way . You 've easily worked it off . <p> BROOK SABIN/Stuff <p> The Lake Dunstan Trail weaves along a steep gorge , with platforms clipped to cliffs . <p> Even , if like me , you cheat and use an e-bike , you 're still burning around 300 calories an hour - so that 's roughly 900 calories over the one-way trail .

@@91156234 <h> Why you should never post photos of your boarding pass <p> Many travellers forget how much information is hiding in plain sight on that boarding pass . Do n't worry this one is from 2010. ( file photo ) . <p> It 's a travel clich ? that 's been around as long as the smartphone -- posting a picture of a boarding pass , perhaps with a glass of bubbles nearby , in a brag to friends , both real and online , of impending adventures . <p> It 's a staple of many an Instagram and Facebook post . <p> But security expert Adam Boileau from CyberCX warns many travellers are forgetting how much information is hiding in plain sight on that boarding pass . <p> " The barcode on the boarding pass contains your name , details of where you are travelling to , your frequent flyer number and also the PNR , the passenger record number , which combined with your last name is typically enough to log onto an airline 's website and alter the booking , " said Boileau . <p> " If you go to Air New Zealand 's website and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meal types , and you are n't a frequent flyer ... then it will give you the option to log in with your PNR number and your last name and all that information is contained on your boarding pass . " <p> While Boileau said most security breaches he 's heard about in New Zealand have been pranks , there have been more serious situations overseas such as hackers stealing frequent flyer miles or points . <p> Blogger Alex Hope said he got the information in just 45 minutes , reported the BBC . <p> He used Abbott 's booking reference that was printed on the boarding pass and was then able to log into his booking and search through HTML code to find his passport number and phone number <p> In his blog , Hope said he contacted the Australian Signals Directorate which handles cybersecurity. : " Anyone who saw that Instagram post could also have them . I felt like I had to like , tell someone about this . Someone with like , responsibilities . Someone with an email signature . " <p> Boileau agrees that those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If you were an Instagram celeb , and you posted your boarding pass on your Insta , somebody could change your meal types for a prank or cancel your booking or change your seats . <p> " You could certainly imagine if ( Prime Minister ) Jacinda Ardern was posting her boarding pass going to the US , someone would absolutely go and mess with her booking . " <p> Airlines have been doing their part to limit privacy issues too . In 2019 , Qantas removed the details of frequent flyer points on the boarding pass " to maintain customer privacy , " reported Executive Traveller at the time . Most major airlines now offer mobile boarding passes , so the days of the printed pass may be numbered . <p> If travellers wanted to find out exactly what information is containing on the boarding pass , Boileau said there are apps which can be downloaded to read the barcode format used , PDF417 . <p> " I just pulled a boarding pass out of my bag just now and tried it , and you can see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't necessarily think what 's in those blocks of data , be it a QR code or a bar code , but there is often more than is visibly printed in human-readable format , so it 's interesting to go in and see what 's in them . " <p> So for travellers who are keen to still brag about a trip , maybe just stick with the photo of the bubbles or , if you have to , blur out details on the boarding pass , and make sure to shred or destroy the boarding pass when you get home . 
@@91179231 <h> Sonos Still Holds the Crown <h> Sonos Still Holds the Crown <p> I still remember my excitement when I installed my first piece of Sonos gear . I was pretty late to the party ; so many people had told me about their amazing Sonos setups - raving about their crazy good soundbars and seamless multi-room audio . <p> I kept hearing Americans advertising Sonos products on podcasts - everyone seemed unanimous in their effusive praise for the brand . Suspiciously so ... surely there was no way the real deal could live up to the hype ? <p> But then I got my own ; a Sonos Arc sound bar teamed with a pair of One SL surrounds . Oh boy , turned out they were right . All of them . <p> An elegant , streamlined , wireless home theatre that sounded ... well ... sensational . The power . The dynamic range . The 3D effects . I was in aural ecstasy . I had arrived . <p> Given it was the original Sonos Beam soundbar that really propelled Sonos into the stratosphere of home sound solutions back in 2018 , obviously I was keen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , almost out of nowhere , there came an even more budget-friendly option . <p> So why not give them both a go ? All research is useful research , right ? <p> Compared to my Arc , both the Beam ( Gen 2 ) and the all new Ray are just babies . At about 65cm long for the Beam and only 56cm for the Ray , either of these soundbars will fit into spaces the somewhat oversized Arc never could . <p> Like the Arc , the new devices are available in both black and white and whereas the original Beam was covered in a fabric mesh , the grilles on these soundbars are a much more durable and easy-care , precision-cut polycarbonate . <p> While the Beam retains its traditional **26;1800;TOOLONG shape , the front of the Ray splays out in a more trapezoid fashion . The major differences are internal , of course . The Beam boasts five amplifiers versus the Ray 's four , although the Ray has two tweeters while the Beam has only one . The Beam has four midwoofers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differently in each device too . Despite these variables , both soundbars sound great but more on that shortly . <p> There are two more obvious differentiators between these models ; only the Beam ( Gen 2 ) offers voice control by linking with Amazon Alexa . For some reason Google Assistant is still not available for Sonos in New Zealand . Come on Google , lift your game . To be fair , Sonos ' own Voice Control is n't here yet either . <p> The other big difference is super weird . The Ray only connects via its included optical cable - no HDMI to be seen . I have n't connected anything with optical for about 15 years and I assumed this technology was on the way out . Luckily , there 's an optical cable included in the box . The really odd thing about this is Sonos is marketing the Ray as a way to " Take gaming to the next level ... " yet neither the latest Xboxes or PlayStation have optical outputs . This does n't mean you ca n't use the Ray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feed from your TV instead . Most TV 's do have optical ports and if you 're using the Ray as your primary audio component of your home theatre , it 's the TV you 'll be plugged into anyway . That said , it 's a lot more complicated setting up my TV 's remote to control the Ray via optical than it is to pair with the Beam via HDMI eARC - but I got there in the end . <p> Sonos also claims setting up either of these speakers is super simple , just a matter of following the steps on the Sonos app . That 's kind of true , although many speakers just work when you plug them in and turn them on . The difference here is what makes a Sonos system so superior ; Wi-Fi connectivity means reliable , room-to-room control . There are also a host of fine-tuning features in the app you just wo n't find with other systems - for example , you can adjust the height of your soundscape on the Beam and both speakers offer Trueplay tuning if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to teach your soundbar the unique audio characteristics of your room so stereo and other effects can be played accordingly . <p> Like any Sonos speaker , once you 've added the Ray or Beam to your Sonos profile , you can then choose to stream from any of your connected services , or play different things on different speakers if you prefer . The wonder of wireless home audio is literally in your hands . This is where the Beam 's voice assistant abilities give it quite the advantage , as you do n't even need your phone to control it . <p> Without getting too bogged down in sound-nerd tech specs , both these soundbars produce top quality audio - I mean , you 'd expect no less from Sonos , I 've certainly never been disappointed . While you might not consider a soundbar as your first choice for music reproduction , these are both great options - the size and number of speakers in each device almost certainly outpaces your bog-standard bluetooth box . <p> Then once you get to movie time ( or TV time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivers . If you 're looking for depth , height and convincing stereo separation , both the Beam ( Gen 2 ) and the Ray really come to the party . I expected no less from the Beam , given its predecessor 's acclaimed reputation but I 've been just as impressed by the smaller ( and significantly cheaper ) Ray . I even hid it behind my TV , just to see how that would effect things and it still sounded great . <p> Neither device offers bone-shuddering bass response - the bass is there , it just wo n't rattle the windows ( or bother the neighbours , for that matter ) . However , there 's nothing stopping you adding the Sonos Sub to your system - although that alone costs more than the Beam and Ray combined . <p> You also have the option to add a pair of One SL surround speakers to complete your home theatre experience . If you can stretch the budget , I 'd definitely recommend this to get the most out of your new system . When it comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's no doubt the new , improved Beam is a superior speaker to the Ray , especially given its extra features and more user-friendly HDMI eARC connectivity , to my ears , the difference in out-and-out sound performance is not as dramatic as you might expect . This makes the NZ$449.00 Ray exceptional buying and the money you save might be better spent on a sub or surrounds . <p> Either way , I 'm sure you 'll be just as excited as I was when you get that box ( or those boxes ) home and finally experience some Sonos for yourself .

And even if Sun could pull it off physically , he was well aware that Zhong had tried to portray him as " some sort of gangster with no regard for the law " , Wimsett said . <p> " He 's not a complete idiot .

" <p> The Wairarapa farm boy who became a chef co-opened Wellington 's Logan Brown restaurant before moving north to establish Depot . He is a longtime champion of the New Zealand food story - hunting , fishing , foraging - but , more recently , has begun to speak about being adopted , having dyslexia , a marriage break-up and mental health challenges . Brown is not just learning a language - he is figuring out who he is and where he belongs . <p> " I 've been outing my issues , " he says . " And I find the connections in Te Ao Maori - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how they look after each other , that whole family and whanau thing - that 's what I 've been drawn to . " <p> Last Saturday , Brown set a restaurant table for 12 . He paced . He frowned . He wanted to get this exactly right and he was as nervous as hell . Hepa Lolesi arrived with her grown-up children , their partners and a guitar ; Brown 's eldest daughter , Alice , joined the group . Introductions , explanations and banter . Where did you get the oysters ? They came from Marlborough . Yeah , but which rock , exactly ? <p> Manaakitanga is defined as a noun and an action . Hospitality and kindness , the process of showing respect , generosity and care . The Depot kitchen sent out two plates of doughnuts , a riff on paraoa parai ( fry bread ) oozing savoury kina custard and spiked with powdered karengo and plump plops of salmon roe . Where 's the kina ? Hmmm , said Brown , " this is the gateway version for Pakeha - you probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> There would be tears before the pork hock . Brown had n't seen the taonga being passed around the table - the toki , or adze-shaped pendant he would receive from Lolesi in lieu of missing last year 's graduation from her class . She tells him the dark green stone is kawakawa pounamu . <p> " It sits in the ground for a long time , it gets covered up and stood on and trampled on and then it gets dug up . . . it reminds me of you my friend .

I feel like I 've carried a guilt around with me for a long time about colonisation and what happened back then . It was a long time ago , but it 's still very relevant . How can I , personally , add something or bring us together a little bit ? My tiny little contribution is to be vulnerable and try to learn a beautiful language . " <p> Al Brown ( left ) and kaiako Hepa Lolesi hongi following the presentation of a pounamu toki to the chef at his Auckland restaurant , Depot . Photo/Dean Purcell <p> He admits : " I started feeling that I was n't good enough and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then it dawned on me that , actually , that was pretty arrogant to think I could just learn a language . Children are in immersion for how long , and when do they start using a few words ? <p> " And now I 'm learning whakairo , learning to carve and using my hands . I 'm dyslexic and this has allowed me to find a way that I can still learn and be in that world , at my own pace . " <p> There is freedom , says Brown , in making yourself vulnerable . <p> " I 've struggled with this idea of perfectionism , that I have to be perfect , and that 's because of the adopted situation and a lack of understanding around where I come from . The idea of something like this where I ca n't be perfect , makes me uncomfortable , but I think it 's also therapy for me as well . <p> " I 'm not good in the traditional classroom , but I find the carving really amazing for my mental health . Slowing down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something away - that 's not lost on me at all . " <p> Hepa Lolesi is Tainui . She married her Samoan husband 38 years ago and they have six children and nine mokopuna .

So as a kaiako , a teacher , we wait and we wait . Al was amazing because he did n't care if he got it wrong , which just truly opened that classroom up to everybody trying to do their best . " <p> Finding out the why ( and why not ) of someone 's learning journey is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ? " is even more profound . <p> " Time has picked them to come in and embrace the kaupapa . Usually , when we 're talking about whakapapa and pepeha , that 's the time they have to dig deep . Where they came from , their tipuna , how did they get here and where are we going ? Sometimes , I just see myself as a planter . I just spread the seeds and if the whenua is fertile enough , it will take . Every tauira grows at a different pace , you ca n't hurry it , you ca n't force it on anybody .

Baby steps , he acknowledges , but the more knowledge you put in your kete , the better . <p> Has Brown experienced any backlash to his te reo study ? Of course , he says and he really does n't want to tell this story , but it underscores his point : He 's hosting a function when it dawns on him the crowd is mostly white and very wealthy . An internal voice asks whether a mihi is the best way to open and he fights with himself , resolving that yes , he has made this commitment and this is the most important place for him to do this . Halfway through the first sentence of his greeting , a voice from the crowd rings out : " No need . " <p> Brown : " I mean , you do n't even need to ask that question because we all know there is embedded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . I do n't know whether this person was doing it to be funny . The room was silent and it ruined my evening to be honest . You know what really got me ? Only one person came up to me and said sorry about what happened . " <p> Brown has traced his birth parents and , as far as he knows , he has no Maori heritage . He says he finds the concept of whakapapa - the genealogy that connects generations - extremely powerful . <p> " How much strength can you feel , from knowing your ancestors have got your back ? I can only observe as a Pakeha , but I watch and I 'm drawn to it ... I guess I feel vulnerable that Maori might look at me and say ' who do you think you are , learning about our culture , you 're just a Pakeha ? ' But I have to weigh that up . There are people who want to say that and make me feel small . But that 's not going to stop me doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a long , long , long way to go . " <p> Lolesi is a quiet listener who corrects his pronunciation and offers a prompt when he loses a word . " He ngakau Maori , " she tells him . " You 've got a Maori heart - or a Maori freckle in there somewhere ! It comes out in your aroha for people . " <p> A fritter is such an informal but delicious thing to cook and eat . You can substitute different shellfish in this recipe , like mussels , pipi or cockles . The kumara is an inherently Kiwi vege , helping bulk out the recipe if you are short on kai moana , and adds a subtle sweetness to the equation . <p> Place tuatua in a colander to drain . Roughly chop and place in a medium-sized bowl.Place kumara in a small saucepan , cover with salted cold water , bring to a boil and cook for 2-3 minutes until just soft .

The lemon imports which normally come in around Christmas ( from California ) were interruptedso the domestic prices remained higher than normal .

" There are about 15,000 tonnes of imports across all the varieties ... that is seasonal so for that to be replaced we would have to find different varieties to widen the season . If we had more access to early or late varieties then you would compete directly against the import product . But it is not an easy thing to do and involves a breeding programme that takes a long time .

The harvest period is a few months so it is easier than some crops . But it is still difficult . " <p> Citrus NZ works with MPI with a programme called Opportunity Grows Here , a campaign using social media and print ( newspapers and billboards ) which publicises seasonal work opportunities . Growers and packers are encouraged to then post their jobs on a website called PickNZ . <p> Overall the industry is stable . Some older citrus blocks are being pulled out in Gisborne to be replaced by higher value crops such as Gold kiwifruit or some licensed apple varieties .

Photo : Diane McCarthy . <p> Pikowai resident Rodger Allan is worried there soon will not be any sand dunes left in front of his home if the Bay of Plenty Regional Council does not take action , as it has in the past . <p> The Mimiha and Herepuru streams that normally flow out of the valley along the Pikowai straight and empty into the ocean have recently been redirected along the beach by a naturally formed sandbank just offshore . <p> Rodger , who is 80 years old and has operated as an orchard developer around the Bay of Plenty for over 50 years , says the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the railway line . <p> It 's something that occurs from time to time , but is easily corrected . <p> The last time this happened , around two years ago , he says the river had eaten away 10 metres of dune area in just four days . <p> When he told the regional council , they came out with a digger and dug a trench through the sandbank to redirect the river water away from the dunes . <p> He says that this time the erosion is worse than before . <p> " The stream entrance blocks up when you get a storm and it needs opening up , otherwise it starts heading along the beach . <p> " We 've done it ourselves once or twice since the regional council did it two years back . If you get it quick enough , you can just do it with a shovel . Once the water starts running through , it just gouges out its own channel and goes back to its natural place . This time it 's got away on us and now the sandbank is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , but with a digger it 's 10 minutes work . " <p> However , this time , the regional council has refused to take any action , saying it is just nature taking its course . <p> The Mimiha and Herepuru streams are cutting a path along the beach , eating into sand dunes as they go . The above photo was taken two weeks ago , and below photo was taken last week after the storm . <p> Regional council land management officer Rusty Knutson says dunes are dynamic and change all the time . <p> " The new stream direction is a naturally occurring event . While the stream often goes directly out to sea , this course is sometimes blocked - usually by sand after strong winds or storm events - forcing it to go in a different direction , as it has many times in the past . In this case , the new pathway is parallel to the beach , but it 's unlikely that this course will be permanent . <p> " When erosion does occur , lost sand typically accumulates in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back onshore when the wave and wind conditions are more favourable to dune formation . " <p> Rodger says in the past , farmers have brought their tractors down and opened the sand bank that was blocking the stream from heading out to sea . <p> " You go to jail if you do that nowadays . You need a resource consent and permission from the iwi and this and that and the other thing . The regional council spend all this money to restore the sandhills , spray them for weeds and plant pingao and yet they let them get washed away . " <p> He says he and his neighbours look after the dotterels on the beach in front of his home , fencing off areas where they are nesting . <p> " There were about seven nests on this beach last year . Now the river 's right on top of where they normally nest . " <p> He says he has voiced concern to the council that the railway tracks could be in danger , but Knutson says there are no indications to suggest they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adversely affected . <p> " While the dotterels will be nesting soon , they will adapt to the current direction and placement of the stream to find a suitable place to nest .

@@92395239 <h> Political Roundup : Why James Shaw needs to go <p> James Shaw has lost his co-leadership position in the Green Party , and there 's a good chance he wo n't be able to get it back . And he should n't -- it wo n't be good for either him or his party . <p> When delegates at the Green Party AGM voted on his position as co-leader on Saturday , it was expected Shaw would simply be re-elected , particularly as there were no other candidates for the position . But about 30% of delegates essentially voted " no confidence " in him , surpassing the 25 per cent threshold that triggers the requirement for the Greens to re-open nominations for the co-leader position . <p> So the party is now led only by Marama Davidson , and nominations for the other co-leader position close in about a week . <p> Shaw still has a decision to make <p> Shaw has come out today confidently announcing that he will fight to win the leadership back . He 's trying to stare down those that are plotting , both in the wider party , and in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chloe Swarbrick announces that she wo n't stand against him and , ideally , gives him her full support . <p> But do n't be surprised if none of that happens . Wiser heads might even persuade Shaw to withdraw his nomination before the end of the week . Shaw and his backers are likely to realise that the tide has turned against him amongst party activists and Green voters . <p> There 's now an appetite for leadership renewal , and if Shaw is smart he will end up championing that rather than fighting against it . He still has the chance to look magnanimous in handing the reins over willingly to Swarbrick . And if she gets anointed by him as the next leader , Swarbrick will win the contest next month hands down . <p> Swarbrick 's time has come <p> There is no doubt that Swarbrick is significantly more popular with either Shaw or Marama Davidson . She was a rising star before she even joined the party , having performed incredibly well as a mayoral candidate for Auckland in 2016 . Since then she has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winning the Auckland Central race last year -- which was no mean feat . The only other Green MP to win a seat has been Jeannette Fitzsimons with Coromandel in 1999 . <p> TDB Recommends NewzEngine.com <p> Swarbrick regularly appears as a favourite " preferred prime minister " in polls and has very high favourability ratings . Pollster David Farrar points out today that his firm carried out polling late last year which " showed Swarbrick had three times the favourability of James Shaw with all voters -- she was at 23% and Shaw at 8% " . <p> That Swarbrick has already gone to ground and is refusing to comment on whether she is going to run for the leadership is very telling . Herald political editor Claire Trevett writes today that Swarbrick 's silence about whether she will challenge is possibly because " she is taking soundings on whether she has a chance of toppling Shaw in a vote . " <p> A lot hangs on what Swarbrick decides to do in the next 24 hours . Even if she had n't previously thought about taking Shaw on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seriously considering it , and many in the party will be pressuring her to seize the moment . <p> The leadership is clearly hers for the taking but if Shaw re-nominates then she would have to be willing to knife her sometimes-ally . <p> Another possibility is that Swarbrick and Shaw come to some sort of negotiated handover . This might allow Shaw to stay on for longer , with the understanding that Swarbrick 's time will soon come . <p> Shaw needs to read the writing on the wall <p> If Shaw attempts to win the leadership back , it is likely to be a disaster for both him and his party . Firstly , he might not actually win . In a contest against Swarbrick decided by Green Party members he 's unlikely to prevail . <p> There is significant support for Shaw , but much of it from outside the Greens . If the Labour Party supporters were to have a say then Shaw would win in a landslide . But Labour and National supporters coming out with statements about what a thoroughly decent chap Shaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . Even Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern 's endorsement of him probably hurts him more than it helps him at the moment . <p> Second , even if no other candidates stand for the position , there 's always the threat that more than 25% of delegates will again vote to veto his leadership , once again re-opening the nominations process . This would be intolerable for both Shaw and the party and he would have to go anyway . <p> Thirdly , even if Shaw fought for the leadership and won , he would be a lame duck leader with his authority deeply diminished . As political commentator Matthew Hooton wrote in the weekend , " he is mortally wounded ... The clock is ticking and no one thinks he has any chance of surviving much beyond the election . That makes him a lame duck from now on " . <p> Hooton suggests that the moderate Shaw now be replaced by the moderate Swarbrick : " there is an argument that perhaps the Teal Greens should just accept the dagger has found its mark , Shaw will now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow Teal Chl ? e Swarbrick now " . <p> This is one of the key factors that Shaw will need to consider -- by fighting to regain his leadership he might spark a destabilising contest in the party . There are clearly growing elements in the Greens that wo n't back down until he is gone from the leadership . By battling these activists , even if he wins , Shaw damages the party . The public quickly lose faith in parties and leaders who are divisive and unstable . The Greens ca n't afford to go through a civil war , as the Alliance did in 2002 , which led to their demise . <p> What 's more , if Shaw left the leadership , it does n't mean that he would have to step down as Climate Change Minister . In fact , this is a position he could do with focusing more time on . And it is , after all , a more prized role for him than his party leadership . <p> Shaw might also want to remember how Andrew Little had to accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the 2017 general election . He admitted defeat , allowed Jacinda Ardern to take his place and has gone on to have a respectable ministerial career . His conduct ensured his political career was n't over , and he came out of the episode with increased respect within the party . <p> The Greens are compromised under Shaw <p> The Greens are likely to do much better with Swarbrick than Shaw at the helm . Under Shaw the party has ossified and come across as incredibly conventional , no longer being seen challenging Labour like their supporters want them to . Instead , they appear more as a prop to their coalition partner . <p> With Shaw leading the party -- and as Climate Change Minister -- the Greens have also risked looking like they are playing a " greenwashing " role for Labour , making the government appear more dedicated to action on climate change than it actually is . <p> That 's certainly the view held by former Green MP Sue Bradford , who was interviewed by the Herald yesterday : " Bradford said that under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the co-leaders Shaw and Marama Davidson were being used to ' greenwash ' Labour 's environmental and housing policies . The climate change agreement Shaw had struck was ' feeble ' , she said . " <p> Of course , Shaw 's position was compromised from the day he decided to take the offer of Climate Change Minister under the current government , even though Labour did n't actually need the Greens ' support . It meant Shaw would have little real leverage on climate issues , and would instead have to promote the decisions made by the Labour Cabinet . It 's been a poisoned bauble . Not only does he have primary responsibility for a policy most Green members see as thoroughly inadequate but , as minister , he ca n't even publicly distance himself from a policy he privately also thinks is inadequate . <p> But would Swarbrick be more popular with the activist left in the party ? It 's not entirely clear . She is from the same moderate wing of the Greens as Shaw , but also seems more capable of being radical at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outspoken about Labour 's failings . This is what Marama Davidson promised when she took over the other co-leadership position , but has consistently failed to do . Perhaps Swarbrick can be the party leader who is not entrapped by the baubles of power . <p> As a response to his ousting in the weekend , Shaw is already trying to reposition himself as more radical and more connected with the party 's activists . In his interviews and speeches today he is using the more radical language and demands that his detractors use . At this stage it might not be very convincing to those activists who see his past actions contradicting his newfound radicalism . Shaw simply does n't sound authentic . <p> Not only does his inauthentic radicalism prove his critics right , but those that are suspicious of Shaw will also have noticed how shocked he was that he was rolled in the weekend . Shaw was either unaware of the rising discontent in his party , or he was dismissive of it . Either way , it 's shown him up as being guilty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the grassroots . <p> Because the Greens are in power and have been polling steadily since the last election there are many in the Beehive beltway who struggle to understand why Shaw is in this position . The core issue is one of policy -- not polling . It speaks much as to how Labour and National leaders live and die by polling results , rather than what they stand for and actually do in office . <p> It 's now up to Chloe Swarbrick to show that she is more in touch with activists and ready to fight harder against climate change , economic inequality and other social ills .

When they swivelled in front of the fitting room mirrors , they would see images of doves in flight printed across their backs . <p> Ultimately they would get to judge for themselves how the boxy silhouettes and thick cotton differed from Gap 's typical offering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortunes of the brand : to make people across the country line up in anticipation , spend with alacrity and see Gap once again as a defining , disruptive staple of American fashion . <p> As opposed to viewing it as a corporation -- Gap Inc. is the parent company of Gap , Banana Republic , Old Navy and Athleta -- that is currently wrestling with the departure of its CEO after only two years , along with diminishing profits ( including a net US$162 million loss in the first quarter of this year ) and dwindling cultural relevance . <p> It was that uncool factor that seemingly drove Gap to announce , in June 2020 , a 10-year deal with the undeniably cool Ye and his fashion line Yeezy , with the option to renew at the five-year mark , at which point Gap hoped Yeezy Gap would be generating US$1 billion in annual sales . Though mass-market brands have engaged in one-off collaborations with high-end designers and celebrities for years , Yeezy Gap was , in scope and ambition , unlike any the retail world had seen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the partnership yielded just two products , both sold only online . <p> It was n't until a third party , Balenciaga , the French luxury house , entered the collaboration that a full Yeezy Gap collection was finally released this year ( though it was still relatively small , with 36 styles in total unveiled in May ) . This weekend , a portion of the collection was rolled out in about 50 stores nationwide , in cities including Chicago , Dallas and San Francisco : a selection of eight styles , with more promised later in the year . <p> It is a milestone in the much-watched collaboration , but one that raises the question : What took so long ? <h> When corporate meets creative <p> Going into the Gap deal , Ye had a certain track record in the fashion-for-the-masses business ; in 2020 , the sneaker collaboration between Yeezy and Adidas brought in nearly US$1.7 billion in revenue , according to Bloomberg . <p> He had less success in building a ready-to-wear brand . An early attempt at a glitzy namesake luxury label in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimal , conceptual athleisure Yeezy yielded unpredictable results ( including one widely criticized show on Roosevelt Island at which models fainted in the heat ) . Still , there was no denying his cultural influence and compulsive watchability . <p> Gap 's footing was less sure . In 2020 , the brand 's net sales ( about US$3.4 billion ) had been declining every year since 2013 , largely in line with the demise of many traditional shopping malls ( and not helped by the pandemic ) . That year , Gap Inc. said it would close 30 per cent of its Gap and Banana Republic stores in North America , about 350 locations in total , by January 2024 . <p> Industry wisdom said the company needed something big to stop the downward spiral . Ye was about as big as they come . <p> But he was not , as Mickey Drexler , who led Gap from 1983 to 2002 , told Yahoo Finance in 2021 , " a corporate person , and Gap is a big corporation , " with hierarchies , systems , calendars and fluency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deal . " It does n't make any sense , in my opinion , " Drexler said at the time . <h> Advertisement <p> Workers for Yeezy Gap outside the Gap 's Times Square store in New York . Photo / Hiroko Masuike , The New York Times <p> Julie Gilhart , the president of Tomorrow Projects , agreed . " In my experience , Gap was all about risk management , " she said . " They did n't want to disgruntle anyone . And if you go with Kanye , you have to know there is risk involved . " <p> One week after the Yeezy Gap deal was announced , for example , he announced his run for president ; a string of heated campaign remarks and tweets about his family compelled his wife at the time , Kim Kardashian West , to make a statement about his bipolar disorder . <p> But the controversy did not deter either side . They had agreed to an arrangement in which Ye 's fortunes were tied to those of his products ; he received stock warrants that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million in a fiscal year , -- were met , as well as royalties . ( Gap has not disclosed the line 's sales figures to date . ) <p> Ye -- whose vision , according to Gap , was to create " modern , elevated basics for men , women and kids at accessible price points " -- got to work , bringing on Nigerian-British designer Mowalola Ogunlesi as design director and testing out pieces as early as the summer of 2020 . ( Ogunlesi left after a year , at the expiration of her contract . ) <p> According to two people who worked on the collaboration , the original goal was to have a collection ready by Singles Day , an annual Chinese shopping event , in November 2020 . The garments were conceived to be relatively affordable , priced around US$50 . <p> Images from that period shared with The New York Times showed brightly coloured pants , shorts , shirts , hoodies and belts , all in line with the traditional casual clothing associated with Gap . ( In a video shared on Twitter by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one tie-dye-effect pink and purple bodysuit is visible . ) At the time , there were numerous " style-ups " -- a fashion term that means trying out samples of clothing on bodies to see how they look -- photographed by Nick Knight , the SHOWStudio founder and longtime Yeezy collaborator , and paid for by Gap . <p> But these designs were never put into production , despite what the two former employees described as long hours and mounting impatience from Gap over missed deadlines -- and despite the fact that it is almost unheard-of in the industry to eliminate almost an entire collection once samples have been made . <p> According to Zac Posen , who has worked with Target , Brooks Brothers and David 's Bridal , as well as having his own fashion line , the " standard " ratio of sample garments that ultimately end up in stores was historically 2 to 1 ( for every two samples , one was chosen and one discarded ) . Though Posen said he had " heard of 3 to 1 or even 4 to 1 , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially public brands like Gap , become more oriented to the bottom line . <p> Ye , however , was widely known to be both a perfectionist and a nonconformist . <p> " I do n't think his mentality is at all the mentality we see in more classic fashion houses , " said Knight , the photographer . " If he wants to spend a year looking into the colour blue , we 'll spend a year looking into the colour blue , which is extremely inspiring when so often schedules take priority over creativity . He does n't see himself in any way constrained by deadlines or seasons . I do n't think he would even use the word ' collection ' for what he is doing . " <p> Referring to the 2020 designs that were n't put into production , a Gap spokesperson said in an email that " a collection was not discarded ; this was part of the creative process . The team was intentional about iterating until they were satisfied . " The broader goal was " product development , testing and learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process was the " round jacket , " a puffy jacket with no closures made from recycled nylon and polyester fill . <p> This was Yeezy Gap 's first piece , made available for purchase in June 2021 , nearly one year after the partnership was announced . It was sold for US$200 in three colours ( first blue , then black and later red ) , and those who preordered received the jacket about five months later . <p> Yeezy Gap 's second piece dropped online a few months later : a plain , heavy cotton hoodie in six colours for US$90 . Ye later claimed that after airing a commercial featuring the hoodie , Gap sold $14 million worth of the black version . ( Gap would not confirm this figure , though previously said the hoodie broke its single-day online sales record . ) <p> Its name ? The " perfect hoodie . " <h> The Balenciaga factor <p> Between the puffer and the hoodie , Gap intervened , hiring Leonardo Lawson , the former CEO of the British brand the Vampire 's Wife , to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lawson said . ( Ye did not respond to requests for comment for this article . ) <p> Lawson 's directive has essentially been to build a conduit between Yeezy and Gap , acting as a translator of sorts . He helped open a Los Angeles office for Yeezy Gap , whose operations had previously been spread out across several cities , depending on where Ye and his core team were at any given time . This " innovation studio " today houses about 20 employees , said Lawson , who was promoted to head of Yeezy Gap in March . <p> " We 're constantly flexing , depending on the needs , and helping each side understand what the asks are , why things need to be done , what maybe we can not do , " he said . <p> Lawson was asked about the early structural difficulties of the partnership . " When I came here , to be honest , I saw it , " he said . " I think everyone knows and understands that Ye 's background and pedigree and fashion is really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems and how those companies work and are set up are very different than how a company like Gap is set up . So it was really about bringing these two worlds together . " <p> Meanwhile , Ye , who released his album " Donda " the same month Lawson was brought on board , had already asked Demna to get involved . <p> Taking the Yeezy Gap " round jacket " for a walk . Photo / Dolly Faibyshev , The New York Times <p> The mononymous creative director of Balenciaga had worked with Ye on his first Yeezy collection , " Season 1 , " in 2015 , and the two men have maintained an ongoing creative conversation via WhatsApp and text -- Ye 's preferred means of communication -- ever since . <p> " Ye called me in March 2021 telling me he was working on this project , and it was his dream for me to work together with him on it , " Demna said this month . " He said this is what he needs there : to bring this know-how to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patternmaker . The way they were doing things was more trying them on and styling rather than constructing . " <p> Though he was busy with several Balenciaga collections , Demna said he felt the need to " be there for him to help him create a solid foundation for Ye 's aesthetic on which they can now build . To accelerate the process . " Hence the name of the collaboration : " engineered by Balenciaga . " They were , Demna said , engineering the prototypes in the Balenciaga studios in Paris and Zurich after he and Ye talked ( or texted ) through the ideas . <p> " Lots of talking , thousands of images shared , " he said of their exchanges . They talked about how Ye wanted a " fabric that is very light but also warm and makes no sound -- kind of like nylon , but not nylon . Things that seemed to be impossible or very hard to make technically . <p> " Ye 's not really interested in fashion at all , " Demna said . " He wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hoodie ? What 's next ? What do we want to wear in 20 years ? ' " <p> Then , Demna said , once " the shape was there , I would make a decision -- OK , it 's ready , we launch it . " At that point , he would send the designs to Ye and the Gap teams in Los Angeles , after which they would " start the process on how to industrialise them . " ( Ye also went to Paris , and Lawson said prototypes were also created by the Yeezy Gap team in Los Angeles , and characterised the work as a three-way partnership . ) <p> " Me being on board gave him reassurance , " Demna said , " so there could be a moment of letting go . " <p> And the clothes , which included a catsuit ( US$300 ) , cargo pants ( US$220 ) and thigh-high boots ( coming later this year ) , could , with the help of the strengthened Los Angeles infrastructure , make it out of the experimental phase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first Yeezy Gap Engineered by Balenciaga ( or YGEBB , as it 's called internally ) designs were made available for purchase online in late February . <p> A week later , Ye was in the news again , for a music video in which an animated version of himself buries Pete Davidson , Kardashian 's new boyfriend , alive . <h> What happens now ? <p> Gap 's preferred word to explain the unconventional production timeline of Yeezy Gap is " fluid . " <p> The work with Balenciaga " really has been a fluid collaboration , " Lawson said . The entire experience of building Yeezy Gap " has been about being fluid , " and " creating new ways of doing things , and understanding how these ways of doing things will impact the bigger Gap brand and help everything be a little bit more fluid . " <p> But is fluidity enough to help Gap make a profit ? This spring , before the largest Yeezy Gap drop to date ( the Balenciaga collection in late May ) , analysts who spoke to the Times were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company . <p> " Anyone who was excited about the Yeezy partnership when it was announced is disappointed with the amount of product that is coming out , " said Simeon Siegel , a retail analyst at BMO Capital Markets . <p> The discussion around Yeezy Gap has largely morphed from focusing on sales to focusing on buzz . And Gap is investing considerably in that buzz : in addition to fees Ye has already been or will be paid for the collection -- and the costs of maintaining the innovation studio , as well as its sampling and production -- Gap also provides support for music videos and concerts that feature Yeezy Gap products . <p> " The Yeezy line was never going to be big enough to change Gap 's fortunes , " Siegel said . " It needed to be powerful enough to elevate the rest of Gap 's brand , and we clearly have not seen that . " <p> The " virtual game experience " playing on screens outside the Times Square store . Photo / Hiroko Masuike , The New York Times <p> With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could change . Already 70% of Yeezy Gap 's customers are first-time Gap customers , the company said during an earnings call last year . <p> Lawson said that Gap interim leadership is fully committed to the Yeezy Gap vision . Ye himself posted a recent statement on Instagram after a call with Gap management calling the executive chairman Bob Martin " one of the most inspiring people I 've heard speak in business . " <p> " Bob I need to meet with you as soon as possible , " he wrote . ( This may not be the way Martin usually sets up meetings , but according to a Gap spokesperson , the appointment was already in motion . ) <p> According to Demna , Balenciaga 's work on the project is now over , and he 's not sure what will happen next . But Yeezy Gap has its sights on other future partnerships , in addition to growing its core business . There is a structure in place to adapt and iterate for the future : Yeezy Gap engineered by ... fill in the blank . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " This was just step No. 1 .

Bromwich <p> Steven Lopez had a robbery charge linked to the 1989 attack cleared from his record . <p> A forgotten co-defendant of the Central Park Five , who , like them , was charged with the rape of a jogger ina case that shook New York City and the nation , is expected to have a related conviction overturned this week . <p> The case against the Five -- teenagers of colour who were innocent of the 1989 sexual assault on a white woman but who were convicted on the basis of false confessions that the police elicited -- continues to shape attitudes surrounding racism in the criminal justice system , the media and society writ large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lopez -- had previously been all but ignored . <p> Lopez , who was arrested when he was 15 , struck a deal with prosecutors just before his trial two years later to avoid the more serious rape charge , instead pleading guilty to robbery of a male jogger . <p> Like his peers , he went to prison ; collectively , the group served close to 45 years . Soon after the true assailant in the Central Park rape was identified in 2002 , authorities overturned the rape convictions against the five men . They have gone on to win a US$41 million ( $65 million ) settlement from New York City and become the subjects of films , books and television shows . <p> But Lopez , now 48 , has not received any settlement money or media attention , and his story is far less well-known . <p> His robbery conviction was tossed out in a Manhattan courthouse Monday ( Tuesday NZ time ) by the chief administrative judge , Ellen N.

" And the other five who were charged , their convictions were vacated . And it 's now time to have Mr. Lopez 's charge vacated . " <h> A signed confession <p> Lopez was 15 when he was arrested and charged with the rape of the jogger , 28-year-old investment banker Trisha Meili . Lopez also faced charges linked to the robbery of a male jogger in the park that same night , April 19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case conducted by the Manhattan district attorney 's post-conviction justice unit , Lopez had been arrested in Central Park after a series of assaults had broken out , including that of the male jogger who was thrown to the ground and beaten . <p> Police held the teenagers at a precinct for hours and hours , pushing them on the details of what had happened in the park . The teens , who were between 14 and 16 years old , said they were led to blame each other for the crime . <p> Lopez was in a holding cell for about 20 hours before he was questioned . His parents , who were not native English speakers , were present , but no translators were provided . After nearly 2 1/2 hours of questioning , a detective wrote out a statement that Lopez and his father signed . <p> The statement placed Lopez at the scene of the attack on the male jogger . But despite aggressive questioning , Lopez refused to say he had been involved in the assault on Meili . <h> Advertisement <p> While a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Lopez had committed crimes against both the male and female jogger , there was no forensic evidence tying him to the attack on the male jogger , who did not identify Lopez as one of his assailants . Forensic investigators , however , identified a hair found on Lopez 's clothing as possibly belonging to the female jogger . ( Later , it was determined that the original investigation 's analysis of hair strands was unreliable . ) <p> Meili had been badly beaten and left for dead . Details of the crime horrified New York City and inflamed racial tensions . Lopez and the other five boys were charged with rape . ( Meili remained anonymous for more than a decade following the attack before identifying herself ; she has objected to the settlement and believes that more than one person attacked her . She could not immediately be reached Monday for comment . ) <h> Convictions and exonerations <p> The teens arrested that night , all of whom were Black or Hispanic , were treated as symptoms of a city descending into crime-ridden chaos . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a famous real estate developer , Donald Trump , who placed full-page ads in the city 's newspapers calling for them to face the death penalty .

McCray , Salaam and Santana were convicted on August 18 , 1990 . Richardson and Wise were convicted on December 11 , 1990 . <p> A month later , right as his trial was scheduled to begin , prosecutors offered Lopez a plea bargain in which he would plead guilty to first-degree robbery in exchange for having the rape charge dropped .

In the litigation that followed the exoneration of the Central Park Five , it emerged that a number of those who had been prepared to testify against Lopez disavowed their previous statements about his guilt . One said that he had only named Lopez after being told the name by police detectives . <p> In 2014 , the Central Park Five received US$41 million from New York City .

He was not featured in the 2012 documentary that Ken Burns made about the case , and no actor playing him appeared in Ava DuVernay 's 2019 television dramatisation of the case , When They See Us . <p> Lopez 's story was ignored , in part because he pleaded guilty . ( Another defendant , Michael Briscoe , pleaded guilty to assaulting a third jogger . His conviction stands . ) He served more than three years of his sentence and did not appeal his conviction . <p> Instead , nearly 20 years after the exoneration of his co-defendants , Lopez quietly reintroduced himself to the Manhattan district attorney 's office in February 2021 , asking that his conviction be reviewed .

" And our understanding now about people who falsely confess translates over to people who will sometimes even falsely admit in court to a crime that they did n't commit . " <p> Bragg , who in January became the first Black Manhattan district attorney , was a 15-year-old living in Harlem when the Central Park case first began to make headlines .

And he stressed that , in times of public concern about safety -- as was the case in 1989 and as is the case again today -- exonerations like that of Lopez could help restore faith in the function of the legal system . <p> " I am beyond humbled to be in a position to really replicate that work , " he said .

@@92442234 <h> Jamie Morton <p> New Zealand 's first Omicron wave may have left the population with more immunity than first thought , experts say , as new modelling indicates cases wo n't reach worst-case heights . <p> In his final media conference today , outgoing director-general of health Dr Ashley Bloomfield said updated modelling indicated the current wave would peak at around 12,000 daily cases -- although numbers were now tracking below that . <p> Today , the seven-day rolling average of community cases stood at 8111 , compared with 9367 the same time last week . <p> While hospitalisation figures could reach 1000 occupied beds , the new modelling showed the country moving closer to a peak of about 850 -- a point nearly reached last weekend . <p> " What is apparent is that the worst-case scenario that our modellers had suggested a couple of weeks ago - with up to 1200 beds occupied , and over 20,000 cases a day - is now highly unlikely , " Bloomfield said . <h> Advertisement <p> The other was previous infection with Omicron appearing to provide stronger than expected protection against BA.5 - the subvariant now accounting for 61 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fast-spreading BA.5 initially caused concern among experts , with preliminary studies indicating it to be four times more resistant to antibodies from vaccines than BA.2 , the type that mainly drove our first Omicron wave . <p> There was also worry over its potential to evade immunity from infection with BA.2 , given its slightly different structure . <p> But studies have been increasingly showing immune memory from prior vaccination or a previous infection -- giving what 's called " hybrid immunity " - has been lingering on to reduce risk of severe illness . <p> That memory included T-cells -- one specific group of these has just been documented to linger for 20 months - as well as B-cells , which could be activated to fight a new infection . <p> Dr Dion O'Neale , of Covid-19 Modelling Aotearoa , agreed there now appeared to be more immunity transfer from BA.2 than BA.5 than had been initially estimated . <p> It was also possible the level of infection across the country during the first wave may have been higher than suspected . <p> As the true level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the 1.5 million cases recorded officially , at least two-thirds of Kiwis had now likely been exposed to the virus - giving them some immune memory in the process . <p> The modelling did , however , show that wave would come over winter -- and that infections would shift into older age demographics , which had proven a major driver of our high hospitalisation rates . <p> " So while immunity has been constantly shifting , some of the scenarios that we looked at , in broad terms , were similar to what 's happened , " Plank said . <p> University of Auckland computational biologist Dr David Welch also acknowledged immunity had been the biggest unknown in earlier forecasts . <p> " If you look at the comparator countries we 've been using , most of these have n't had such a recent wave as we have -- and they also have n't had a wave that 's been so dominated by BA.2 , " he said . <p> " Of course , we also do n't yet have a good idea of exactly how long immunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually going to last . <p> " You only need to make a small change to a model with these parameters , and it can make for a pretty big change to the outcomes . " <p> Shifts in human behaviour -- such as the timing of the school holidays , but also more people being cautious amid growing case numbers , getting boosted and isolating when required -- also might well have contributed to the lower peak . <p> Whether New Zealand would see yet another wave before the year 's end was unclear , but Plank said it was a possibility -- particularly if a significant new variant turned up . <p> Welch also pointed out that case numbers were still running high , and would remain elevated for a while to come . <p> " But perhaps if no variants come along , we might actually drop down to a slightly lower plateau than we had before , because there 'd be even greater immunity in the population . " <p> Otago University epidemiologist Professor Michael Baker pointed out this wave had come at a colder time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health restrictions . <p> " So , given most of the factors are favouring the virus at the moment , the main thing that 's contributed to this wave peaking not as high as expected must be growing host immunity . " <p> Baker said the pandemic still remained an " arms race " between our own immunity and vaccination efforts , and the virus with its constant stream of new variants and subvariants . <p> " This is the equilibrium that , more than anything , will determine where the curve goes in the future -- and it may be that it does flatten out to a relatively low and manageable level some time in the future , " he said . <p> " But , as evolutionary biologists have found , this virus has continued to surprise us with its evolutionary range -- and very few people are predicting what it will do in the medium term . " <p> Further , Baker singled out another factor people needed to consider when thinking about waves and cases . <p> " The burden of long Covid is real -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , prolonged and severe it is overall , " he said . <p> " While it might be good that our immunity is being boosted , it 's bad that we 're getting it from being infected with this virus .

You cut an ant hill in half and there 's all these ants scurrying around . You ca n't put another ant in there because it 'll get eaten . People are going in a lot of different directions , but they know where they 're going , " he said . <p> Vibes in the chamber at night are usually quite different to the day . MPs are often considering the finer points of legislation , and while the pace is less frenetic and there may only be a dozen or so members in the chamber , debate can be intense . Especially during the committee stages of end-of-life legislation and abortion law reform legislation , debates were high on energy running late into the night . <p> According to Assistant Speaker Jacqui Dean , who sometimes runs the House during the evenings , speeches during the evening offer free range for the MP who is passionate on their subject . <p> " Certainly the energy is different than at Question Time . Because at Question Time rather than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government members ( who get to ask questions ) are really in the main just reading a script , and then the Government has more or less free-range , whereas in the evenings members have free range . <p> " So if you 're making any kind of speech in the evening you just go for it . The timing is set but it 's what the MP does within that timing , how they treat that opportunity within the rules is what makes debating exciting in the evenings , " she said . <p> In the chamber at night , strange blunders happen . In recent times , those watching on have been treated to spectacles such as Gerry Brownlee in a delirium over mysterious voices he heard but could n't work out where they came from ( it was a Green MP participating on Zoom with no picture ) ; Statistics Minister David Clark getting hopelessly tangled up while trying to take his mask off to speak ; Trade Minister Damien O'Connor repeatedly forgetting a key word in his own legislative statement and being corrected ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the mic . <p> Finally free from the constraints and pressures of the day , MPs can loosen up or simply be more their pure selves . Things might get peculiar at any old time and sometimes you do n't see it coming , Dean said . <p> " Sometimes , the level of frustration might just boil over and I think that as as we get tireder in the evening then , occasionally , members can just get frustrated and at that point , as a presiding officer , I have to go ' okay let 's calm the farm , let 's just get things back ' , and I do think tiredness does have an impact sometimes on people 's tolerance and reaction to things . You know if you 've got a short fuse and you are really frustrated by the debate , sometimes people can blow their top . " <p> Parliament Chamber Officer Finn Meredith sits at the back of the chamber on a quiet evening session . Photo : VNP / Johnny Blades <h> Late hours <p> It 's not just MPs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thought for Chamber Officers such as Finn Meredith who are part of a team always on hand to ensure Parliament is able to conduct its business smoothly . <p> " During all the euthanasia debates , some nights we worked until 1:30 am . Because so many members had amendments they wanted to the bill , there was 200 amendments or something . So it was voting after voting after voting , so we were just there until the end . <p> " Those euthanasia nights , where they 're on their feet all the time the odd one might take a five-minute power nap on the sofas we got before getting back in there and continuing to work . They 're just normal people , they get tired and we get the job of watching them sleep - but it does n't happen often , " Meredith said . <p> As the night drags on , the committee stage of a bill can involve painstaking work on small details . And when there are lots of amendments proposed , it requires help from the House Office , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the House require to conduct the work of Parliament . <p> " You 're not entirely sure what 's going to come your way . Often there are fewer people around , so your opportunity to bounce ideas off people , to test your thinking , is reduced , and you 're also having to make decisions really quickly , " explained Pav Sharma , the manager of the House Office , whose team 's work at night follows the rhythm in the chamber . <p> " It 's like a mirror to whatever 's going on in the House . So if the chamber is being hectic , if there 's a lot of contention in a bill , if people are wanting to put up amendments to a bill or raising points of order , that temperature in the chamber can really permeate through to the House Office , and we 're having to provide quick advice , turn things around really quickly , maybe copying documents to get them into the chamber as soon as possible , and that atmosphere can be quite thrilling , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours , activity in the chamber can occasionally resemble the end of a wake , where the remaining participants run out of booze to drink , and new things to say . <p> It 's not uncommon for particular members to speak a lot during the committee stage of a bill . For the poor Hansard staff who are there to transcribe everything , it means that for a while they can get drawn into a loop with the same old MP . <p> Andrea O'Brien of the Hansard team said that MPs were mostly more relaxed in the nights which generally felt calmer as there are fewer people on precinct . <p> " But for us in Hansard we are still trying to get the first draft of all speeches to members and published on the website as quickly as we can , so it 's still full steam ahead for us . <p> " You definitely get more tired working at night , but we also work long hours , which also makes you tired .

The smart ones pop out the door for fresh air . <p> I initially mistook ACT MP Karen Chhour for a corporate taxi driver puffing on a vape outside the back door of Parliament while waiting for a passenger , but if it were n't night time I probably would n't have met her . <p> " There 's a whole different vibe to the place . There 's hardly anyone around in the corridors , just the security guards , " she said . <p> " And it 's a time where you 're probably spending more time in the office than during the day - catching up on reading , going through the bills that are coming up , looking at select committees that might be coming up that week and reading through the documents you need to . It 's a lot easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work with the team like you are during the day , getting ready for Question Time . Things like that can take up quite a bit of time during the day . " <p> " It 's a time to listen to what others have to say , and take on board the different opinions . I think it 's a little bit less antagonistic really . " <h> Night shifts <p> Parliament is alive by night on non-sitting days too . If you wander past in the evening you may see the lights on in many rooms - perhaps for a caucus meeting , a public function , an MP club having a soir ? e , cleaners doing their thing , or simply someone getting some concerted mahi done . <p> The place is never totally empty . There are always security staff posted around the precinct . <p> " We 've always got to remain vigilant here because Parliament is a magnet for a lot of people with issues and things like that , " said Finn O'Keefe , the acting manager of Security Operations at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping an eye out just to make sure everything runs smoothly and that no one disrupts especially the House proceedings .

So we 've always got things like that on the back of our mind , " O'Keefe said . <p> The illegal occupation of Parliament grounds earlier this year was a new kind of round-the-clock challenge for the security staff . They handled themselves well in the face of sustained hostility from unhinged elements .

@@92597232 <h> Sky Tower Turns 25 Today <p> Auckland 's iconic landmark the Sky Tower is celebrating its 25th birthday today ( August 3 ) . The Tower has gone from controversial beginnings -- many objecting to a tower of its size dominating the Auckland skyline -- to become a much-loved symbol and feature of the City . <p> More than 10 million people have visited the Tower since it was built by Fletcher Construction in 1997 . At 328 metres it 's the tallest structure in the Southern Hemisphere . <p> SkyCity 's CEO , Michael Ahearne , says the Tower is one of the most visited tourist attractions in the country : " SkyCity owns the Tower , but really we 're just the custodians of it -- it really belongs to the people of Auckland . " <p> A renowned feature of the Tower is its ability to light up in different colours for charities such as Pink Ribbon Day , community initiatives , national holidays , milestones or other celebrations or events . <p> Notes : <p> Sky Tower has been designed and built with safety in mind and is designed to cope with the elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resistance to seismic and wind forces . The Tower can withstand storms with winds gusting to 200kph/hour ( 125mph ) -- an occurrence which is predicted to happen only once in 1,000 years -- and is capable of safely swaying one metre at the top . <p> Sky Tower is built to withstand an earthquake of a magnitude of 7.0 at 40 kilometres , or a magnitude 8.5 at 360 kilometres . <p> In the unlikely event of fire , Sky Tower is equipped with a fire hydrant system that pumps 2,400 litres of water a minute . The upper section of the tower contains a 3-floor refuge able to accommodate over 800 people . <p> In case of lightning strikes , a gold-plated spiked metal dynosphere , 50cm in diameter , is positioned at the top of tower 's 90 metre steel mast .

The glumness is understandable . For months , National and ACT had been dog whistling to the bigots who oppose the creation of Maori wards in local government , by stressing instead the sanctity of the democratic principle of " one person , one vote . " <p> Yet this week , National and ACT have tied themselves in knots trying to justify why the estimated 13,000 members of the multiple property owning classes should be allowed to cast votes in each of the council regions where they own property . To the centre right , it seems that the " one person , one vote " principle applies only to the hapless members of the proletariat who do n't happen to own several properties .

These are the sorts of issues I would be interested in seeing how many people are actually in that position . But my view is they 're not actually altering the proportionality of representation in that region . <p> And here 's National 's Chris Bishop making the same 19th century case for the propertied classes meriting a higher form of democracy . Clearly , his heart is n't in it : <p> Bishop : " I think it 's legitimate that people vote in the areas that they live but also own property , because ultimately they 're paying rates on those . I think there is a legitimate public policy debate , but I think that the status quo is more than defensible and that 's the system we have and that 's what we support . " <p> Yep , it 's a dodgy system but it 's the one we 've got , so he 's sticking by it . So is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The ACT Party 's point is that we always go back to one person one vote , we do believe in one person one vote , so if this is a particular area that is causing concern , we are open to looking into it but I do n't think it is the problem that it looks like , really anyone bringing this up on Twitter is just trying to deflect from the Labour Party 's problem that we actually have a cost of living crisis , crime is going through the roof ... I do n't think this is a real problem . " <p> So it looks like a problem to ACT and ; umm ... van Velden believes in ' one person one vote ' so much she 'll say it twice and ; umm , ACT is open to looking into it but it 's not a real problem even if it looks like one . But hey , look over there ! There 's a cost of living crisis and crime ! And all of that is Labour 's fault ! <p> Footnote : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property owning classes pay rates , so it 's therefore OK for them to have more than one vote in various local body elections . Even so , the " one person , several votes " outcome would seem to erode the sanctity of the " one person , one vote " proportionality principle . In any case , while landlords may be legally responsible for the rates , it is not as if most of them dig into their own pockets . Instead , multiple property owning landlords tend to build the rates ( and other costs , like insurance ) into the rent they charge their tenants , who get to be the ones who actually foot the rates bill . <p> Tenants after all , who pay rent in one location ( say , while they attend university ) but for whom another city counts as home , do n't get to have multiple votes . Surely , the same sort of residency requirement should apply to landlords , who can freely choose which council area is their prime ( and only ) area of voting interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still suffering from a rebound case of Covid , US President Joe Biden has had a couple of good days , regardless . The US drone strike in Kabul against Ayman al-Zawahiri killed the last prominent Al Qaeda member responsible for the September 11 attacks who was not already dead or in custody . More importantly , Biden 's legislative package on climate change ( and related matters ) got kicked back into life again . <p> Over the past fortnight , the US climate change plan had been on life support . Want to know what sort of miserly backroom political deals are necessary to advance the survival prospects of the planet ? Well , something called the Mountain Valley Pipeline aims to transport Appalachian shale gas from West Virginia to Virginia . A new ( and contradictory ) bill that will sit alongside the Biden package has been devised , and it will give a green light to natural gas pipelines like Mountain Valley .

Clue : Manchin represents West Virginia . Now , all that the Democrats have to do is to find a similar sweetener to bring their other maverick senator - Arizona 's Kyrsten Sinema - on board . <p> Mind you , the current bill is now merely a shadow of the multi trillion dollar " Build Back Better " response to climate change and infrastructure renewal that Biden had in mind .

But Biden has something different in mind than the slash and burn approach of cutting taxes and public services that National and the ACT Party are advocating here . The United States at least , seems able to grasp that the social goals that need to be pursued on climate change , healthcare service provision , drug purchasing powers etc will also require additional revenue - which Biden aims to raise mainly by increasing the taxes on America 's biggest corporations and highest earners . The Biden administration has been adamant though , that there will be no new taxes on families making $400,000 or less and no new taxes on small businesses . <p> Contrast this pursuit of a sensible balance -- tax the rich , protect the poor and the middle class -- with the situation here .

Reality check : in the citadel of capitalism , the Biden administration has not only adopted the same approach , but will be making this tax relief available only to low and middle income earners : <p> The deal also includes a means-tested $7,500 tax credit to make new electric vehicles more affordable , and a $4,000 tax credit for used electric vehicles , according to a summary of the package .

@@92621235 <p> The Chief Ombudsman has launched an investigation into concerns that councils are undermining local democracy by using ' workshops ' to discuss issues and make decisions behind closed doors . <p> Mr Boshier is taking action after becoming concerned about the use of workshops and other informal meetings by local authorities and the way some are excluding the public from meetings in general . <p> " There is nothing to prevent councils from holding workshops but I am concerned at reports that some councils may be using them to avoid their responsibilities under the Local Government Official Information and Meetings Act 1987 ( LGOIMA ) . " <p> " Councils must give advance notice of a meeting . They must also provide an agenda and supporting papers at least two days before . Even extraordinary meetings need to be organised and reasonable notice must be given . Importantly , meetings should be open to the public , unless there is good reason under LGOIMA to exclude them . " <p> Mr Boshier says these meetings requirements ca n't be avoided simply by calling what is really ' meeting ' a ' workshop . ' <p> " The public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informal meetings to discuss issues . " <p> Mr Boshier says councils should be aware that holding workshops could create a perception that an issue has already been decided before it is brought to an open meeting for debate and a decision . <p> " I am aware another barrier to openness and transparency is the quality of note-taking and record-keeping during these informal workshops . The public are within their rights to make official information requests about what has been happening during these workshops so accurate accounts are a must . " <p> Mr Boshier says he 'll also be looking at the general approach by councils to notifying and organising meetings in general . <p> " This investigation is particularly timely . This year is the 35th anniversary since LGOIMA was passed by Parliament . One of the foundations of the law is to promote the open and public transaction of business at meetings of local authorities . " <p> " Local government meetings must be open to everyone unless councillors pass a formal resolution to exclude the public . " <p> " I am aware some councils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolutions . " <p> " Local bodies are not allowed to exclude the public from meetings so they can hold ' free and frank ' discussions behind closed doors . Yet I fear this may happening . " <p> " Councillors are elected to provide a voice for the communities they serve . They should feel free to express their opinions in the same way robust exchanges occur in the debating chamber of Parliament . " <p> Mr Boshier says the investigation , using his powers under the Ombudsmen Act , will focus on eight councils across the country . The councils are : <p> Rotorua Lakes Council <p> Taranaki Regional Council <p> Taupo District Council <p> Palmerston North City Council <p> Rangitikei District Council <p> Waimakariri District Council <p> Timaru District Council <p> Clutha District Council <p> " The investigation will look at mix of different sized councils , both urban and rural . I 'll be surveying the public , elected members and council staff in those areas . " <p> " I have chosen these councils for a variety of reasons . Some councils are getting it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and share their good practices with other councils so we can all learn from this investigation . " <p> " I am aware local elections are coming up . I want to make clear this investigation is not about the conduct of individual elected representatives . My focus is on the way meetings and workshops are being organised and administered across the local government sector . " <p> Surveying the agencies and the public <p> To assist in the investigations , the Chief Ombudsman will seek input from the public , councils and their staff . Throughout the course of the investigations , areas of good practice may be identified , and where any areas of weakness are found , suggestions may be made for improvement . <p> The survey looks at the councils ' processes , and peoples ' experiences with them .

@@92728236 <p> Arizona Leger reviews Rikki Swannell 's book Sevens Sisters , the story of how our women 's sevens team reset -- and triumphed -- after their heartbreaking loss to Australia at the 2016 Olympics . <p> Growing up , rugby sevens was a beautiful mystery . I had heard about it , seen it played a couple of times on TV and I knew my dad had played it , but for the longest time I could n't comprehend the sport despite the title being a dead giveaway . The 2012 Epsom Girls ' Grammar School rugby sevens team marked my first attempt at giving it a go . We made the national schools tournament that year . I quickly fell in love with the sport and the culture surrounding it . <p> Later that year , my coach called to ask whether I 'd like to play for the Auckland women 's sevens in a one-off tournament , as they were short on numbers . Within 48 hours I was sitting in the same van as an injured rookie superstar who would go on to make her mark on the world as Tyla Nathan-Wong . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea who she was . That 's been my constant experience with women 's rugby . We 've grown up alongside some of the best in the game so it has n't been hard to be a proud and staunch supporter of them over the years . We essentially witnessed history unfold as childhood superstars became national sporting heroes . <p> Portia Woodman , Sarah Hirini ( or Goss as she was at the time ) , Gayle Broughton and Tyla Nathan-Wong were some of my childhood icons . They have been household names for many dedicated rugby fans and aspiring athletes for a long time . I held them in the same regard as the Richie McCaws of the world , and I still do . They were proof of how talented women are on the rugby field . It was because of them that I believed I could give rugby a go . <p> That might be why I found reading the stories and direct quotes of these women throughout the new book Sevens Sisters such a powerful experience . I learned that Gayle Broughton 's nana once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tyla Nathan-Wong reminded me of the power of provincial rugby : " It reignited the love . To go back home and represent the Cambridge Blue of Northland . " And Niall Williams on the human side of high performance : " I always say a scoreline should never define you as a person , how you treat someone in your team or how you look at them , because no one goes out to lose , drop a ball or make a mistake . " <p> It felt as if they were talking directly with me -- and it dawned on me that a conversation younger me only ever dreamed of will now be a reality for many young wahine who encounter this book . That 's because there has been a monumental shift in the identity and confidence of aspiring women and girls in rugby . And it 's precisely why we need to keep recording and retelling our own histories . <p> In her 15 years as a sports broadcaster , author Rikki Swannell has commentated countless the HSBC World Rugby Sevens Series matches and attended multiple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and articulate so many of New Zealand 's biggest sevens moments , she 's the perfect person to write this book . <p> A special keepsake to the past , present and future of women 's rugby , Sevens Sisters ( subtitle : How a people-first culture turned silver into gold ) shares the true and transparent story behind building , coaching and becoming a Black Ferns player . It 's an insightful and emotional read filled with teachable moments , even beyond the world of sports . <p> Rikki Swannell ( Photo : Supplied ) <p> I 'm an easily distracted millennial who reads a chapter per day at best . ( The last sports book I read properly was Irene Van Dyk 's Shooting for the Top and that was when I was 11 and dreaming that I might one day become a tall , athletic , South African Silver Fern . ) So I opened the first page of Sevens Sisters at 6pm on a work evening with average hopes for my attention span . Almost immediately I was highlighting lines that I connected with and felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sevens culture is underpinned by Maori values , the importance of " people first " cultures and leaving mana in your wake . Four hours later I had finished all 11 chapters and almost every line was fluorescent pink . <p> As a young wahine Maori and teine o le moana who once gave rugby a go and is now working toward delivering our women 's Rugby World Cup this year , this story makes a world of difference . It showcases national sporting success that is grounded in tikanga Maori , player-centric systems and proudly wahine led , a leadership model that many current organisations ' diversity and inclusion strategy attempts could learn from . <p> From the outset , both Swannell and Te Kapa Raupango Takiwhitu ( our Black Ferns Sevens themselves ) demonstrate the importance of recording our own histories . That when history remembers a win , loss or draw , it is just as important to retell the stories and journeys that put those numbers into perspective . Collectively , they take us on a journey from women 's rugby sevens ' inception in 2012 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decade of growth . I laughed , cried , and celebrated along with them . <p> In particular , Sarah Hirini recognising the importance of being named as one of our nation 's flag bearers for the Tokyo Olympics 2021 had me quietly sobbing . Hirini saw it as being about so much more than herself : " ... Being a Maori woman and putting sevens rugby to the fore was very moving and also knowing that somewhere a young kid was watching and might one day want to do that too ... " <p> I remember when head coach Alan " Bunts " Bunting announced he was stepping down from the role after the Tokyo Olympics . There was an outpouring of appreciation from current and former Black Ferns ' flooded social channels . In that moment , you could tell he was a special part of the team 's success , but Sevens Sisters demonstrates exactly how groundbreaking his leadership was . Although I 've never met Bunts I 'll be starting an official fan club for him , Cory Sweeney and the wider team management in recognition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even in moments where they had n't quite believed in themselves . To anyone implying that women could n't play rugby , Bunts would reply , " Yes , they can , they just need opportunities to fail and learn . " After a few years in the programme he talks about the impact of looking after athletes , especially when the road is getting rough , saying " you can still get the best out of people and not kick them out of your environment " . <p> I 'll throw my remaining bravo roses at the vulnerability embedded throughout the book . As a nation still learning the power of being honest about our feelings , it 's that tone of vulnerability that separates this story from past historical recountings . I 'm sure that the team could 've strictly recorded the highlight reel of their journey if they wanted to . We could 've read the Instagram version of their wins , trophies and personal bests -- but instead we are granted an experience that goes much deeper than the best moments . <p> It was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to each of the athletes . Niall speaks vulnerably about her journey through the injury that ended her Tokyo Olympic dream . Shiray Kaka reflects on her own growth journey over the years and Gayle Broughton keeps it real about the make or break moments of her career from an early age . The reader feels the heavy shoulders of that finals loss in Rio , likewise the rush of tears when that full-time whistle blew in Tokyo five years later . It 's a true measure of the " people first " culture that they are globally known for and , as Bunts puts it , " heart performance " . " If you 've got the hearts of your people , the high performance has no ceiling , " he says . That 's now a quote I keep close as we crunch down the final 70-ish days before hosting the women 's Rugby World Cup here in Aotearoa . <p> Throughout , you feel like you 're there on the field , in the gym , or sitting next to our nation 's best sevens players in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've a newfound appreciation for the level of discipline and resilience that it takes to be a Black Ferns Sevens athlete . But even more , I closed the book reassured that a culture underpinned by Maori values , wahine leadership and a mutual agreement to serve a vision bigger than oneself can achieve Olympic gold outcomes . <p> I challenge sports history to share more of these unseen stories , especially in the women 's sports arena . Sevens Sisters is a lesson in the importance of being the author of our own histories -- and a timely reminder that there is always more to the story than the final score . <p> The Spinoff Review of Books is proudly brought to you by Unity Books , recently named 2020 International Book Store of the Year , London Book Fair , and Creative New Zealand .

@@92728237 <h> Ten Commonwealth Games lessons for the Silver Ferns <p> Medalling in Birmingham was never guaranteed , which will make bringing home bronze so much sweeter a year out from the World Cup . Reweti Kohere looks at the tournament 's key takeaways . <p> After carrying the weight of expectation on their shoulders , the Silver Ferns leave Birmingham as bronze medallists , or as captain Gina Crampton has described it , " rose gold " . It 's been a tough campaign for the reigning world champions , overcoming spirited challenges from Uganda and Malawi in pool play , a 10-goal round robin loss to England and a trouncing by Jamaica in the semi-final . A podium finish was never guaranteed , making bronze that much sweeter . As the Ferns turn their attention to defending next year 's Netball World Cup , here are 10 takeaways from the Games . <h> 1 . Gold Coast ghosts are finally banished <p> Failing to medal at consecutive Commonwealth Games was a real prospect for the Ferns . Since the nadir of 2018 , redemption has always been a two-fer under coach Dame Noeline Taurua -- winning the World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have eluded the Ferns , but they have well and truly exorcised their Gold Coast demons . <h> 2 . The first 15 minutes are crucial <p> Poor starts characterised New Zealand 's final matches . Against England in pool play , and Jamaica in the semi-final , the Ferns were down seven and nine goals respectively after the first 15 minutes . By contrast , they started the bronze medal match well , going toe-to-toe with England before ending the final quarter one goal up , 14-13 . From there , they built a durable lead . <h> 3 . Young blood shows promise <p> The future looks bright if the performances of Mystics shooting anchor Grace Nweke ( 20 ) and rising Steel talent Kate Heffernan ( 22 ) are anything to go by . In the bronze medal match , Nweke shot 44 goals from 48 attempts at 91% and dominated veteran England goal keeper Geva Mentor . Heffernan was gritty on defence , winning turnover ball , carrying it through on attack and dulling the impact of England captain Nat Metcalf . And this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Controversial selections prove themselves <p> Dame Noeline threw a few curveballs with her Birmingham selections . Wing attack Whitney Souness was welcomed back at centre ; experienced wing defender Kayla Johnson was picked over 2021 Silver Fern of the year Sam Winders and feisty up-and-comer Maddy Gordon ; and shooters Bailey Mes and Te Paea Selby-Rickit were chosen over former captain Ameliaranne Ekenasio and Tiana Metuarau . While neither Johnson nor Mes featured in Dame Noeline 's starting seven in the bronze medal match , Souness and Selby-Rickit stepped up with patient playmaking , excellent feeding and persistent defence . <h> 5 . Missing firepower is a secret weapon <p> The Ferns were missing defenders Jane Watson and Katrina Rore ( maternity leave ) , and Karin Burger ( injury ) , as well as Ekenasio , who failed to meet fitness standards after returning from her second pregnancy . With their eventual returns likely to boost New Zealand 's firepower , and the current crop having achieved bronze , it 's not hard to believe the World Cup is within New Zealand 's grasp . <h> 6 . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of talent outside the Ferns -- case in point , the New Zealand A and mixed invitational squad members who competed against the Birmingham 12 in the recent Cadbury series . Since the retirement of the World Cup-winning " fossils " -- Casey Kopua , Maria Folau and Laura Langman -- Dame Noeline has had to rebuild the team 's spine around the next group of experienced players and emerging talent . Who will make next year 's World Cup squad is her next jigsaw puzzle . <h> 7 . In Noels we trust <p> She 's uncompromising about fitness and endurance , a stickler for doing the basics well and often , and a netball mastermind . But when Dame Noeline , supported by assistant coach Deb Fuller , announced an unpredictable Birmingham 12 , people were n't convinced . While England and Jamaica exposed the Ferns the first time around , New Zealand came back against the Roses with their most clinical performance to win bronze -- all thanks to the steady hand of Dame Noeline. <h> 8 . Home 's not always sweet <p> Defending champions England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zealand to top pool B. But having failed to make the Netball World Cup final in Liverpool in 2019 , the Roses again fell short of defending their Gold Coast title on home soil , and leave Birmingham empty-handed . " Feel like only one of the two teams playing for Bronze have made peace with their previous result " , tweeted men 's netballer Junior Levi , who played against the Ferns in 2019 and 2020 for the New Zealand men 's team . <h> 9 . We 've got homework <p> The Ferns will need to find some answers quickly ahead of hosting Jamaica next month for the Taini Jamison Trophy series . Following that is October 's trans-Tasman derby , the Constellation Cup . New Zealand did n't face Australia in Birmingham so the annual series between the perennial arch-rivals is an alluring prospect . Dame Noeline has said some " consolidation " is needed from the 12 bronze medallists , although expect to see new and returning faces . <h> More Reading <h> 10 . The sands are shifting <p> The Australian Diamonds may have won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intense it is at the top . Each Commonwealth champion since 1998 went undefeated -- except this year when Australia were beaten by Jamaica in their final pool match . Other history-making moments in Birmingham include neither Australia nor New Zealand topping their respective pools , Jamaica beating Australia and winning an unprecedented silver , and Uganda upsetting South Africa to finish 5th -- their highest ever placing .

Maybe that idea was wrong -- but I do n't care , because beauty is stronger than rational thought , that 's why it looks so good in a tight black pantsuit . Besides , there are so many different Olivias . The syrupy sweet blonde who sang about murdering her love on ' Banks of the Ohio ' . And who would I be if I had never seen the music video to ' Physical ' ? I do n't want to know . This is naughty Olivia , dealing out a stiff role reversal . And the punchline to ' Physical ' -- what a racket ! <p> Olivia you crack me up . As for ' The Promise ' .... one day when I was trying and failing to write about going whale watching in Kaikoura , a memory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leotard and swimming with a pair of laughing dolphins . Could it be for real ? Apparently Olivia wrote ' The Promise ' herself , it was one of her favourites . Beauty is more than skin deep . RIP Olivia Newton-John , from all the little girls who wanted to be you . <p> Dear God <p> Please look after Mum and me and keep us safe . <p> Also when I grow up can I look exactly like Olivia Newton-John ? <p> Amen . <p> I unclenched my hands and hopped into my single bed . That 's a bona fide prayer , circa 1982 . It 's just as well it never happened because I never specified in the prayer what age Olivia Newton-John should be . I thought God would just know , because he was omnipotent and therefore it was inconceivable that God would n't be watching TV like me and therefore know what I meant . <p> The first film I ever saw at the cinema was Grease . I loved it . I did not ponder the feminist treatment of Olivia 's character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film in that tight black leather pantsuit and sang ' You 're the One That I Want ' to John Travolta , I thought her transformation was good . <p> Virgin to whore : what a brilliant narrative arc ! I did n't understand that I would never look good in a tight black leather pantsuit or that I needed more worthy prayers . <p> Nor did I react to a happy ending with cynicism . When John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John drove off into the sky in a big shiny red hot-rod , I simply felt elated . But my prayers did n't end in the 80s -- I prayed for a Happy Birthday Barbie and got one . I prayed for a Care Bear for Christmas ; God did n't come through . I prayed for a Cabbage Patch Doll . No cigar . <p> Grease . It 's Grease . <p> I got my first -- but not my last -- Strawberry Shortcake doll instead . Fair deal . Back then , God must have got a lot of requests for Strawberry Shortcake and her pet cat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , found it hard to keep up with the new dolls in the range . Each was based on a baked fruity morsel with scented hair to match . Mmmm . The sweet smell of Raspberry Tart and her pet monkey , Rhubarb . Alas , that curly-haired tart was never mine . <p> I did however own Plum Puddin ' and Elderberry Owl , and my favourite , cute little Apricot and her pet rabbit Hopsalot . Beneath her suede hat , shaped of course like an apricot , her hair was platinum blonde . So I made Apricot speak in a husky whisper like Marilyn Monroe . Dear God Please look after Mum and me and keep us safe . Also when I grow up can you tell me who created the Strawberry Shortcake doll franchise ? Amen . <p> Barbi Sargent first drew Strawberry Shortcake on a greeting card in 1973 while she was working as a freelance illustrator for the American Greetings Corporation . So Barbi made Strawberry Shortcake -- well , that sure makes for a sweet answer but of course it 's not that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chojnacki learned from market research when he was co-president of Those Characters From Cleveland Inc. , a subsidiary of American Greetings set up to create and license characters to people who make dolls and other merchandise . <p> So Barbi was simply an early influencer . Strawberry Shortcake met her next maker in Muriel Fahrion , another illustrator employed at American Greetings , who gave the sweet little redhead some extra strawberries and a cast of fragrant friends . Muriel then gave her designs to her sister Susan Trental , another employee at the corporation , who made Strawberry Shortcake into a rag doll ... after which Bernie Loomis , president of the General Mills toy division which owned the licence , said : " This is going to be the next major phenomenon in merchandising " . <p> In 1980 , Strawberry Shortcake products grossed 100 million dollars . That 's a lot of answered prayers . And in the 80s my prayers did n't stop , they were just gettin ' started . I also owned Twilight and Windy , a pair of My Little Pony unicorns by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1984 , I got the Baby Cotton Candy pony for Christmas . Accessories : a lavender playpen , a pink heart blanket , a baby bottle with yellow trim , a duck pull toy , a white baby necklace that read ' baby ' , a diaper box containing one diaper to be Velcroed around Cotton Candy 's tush ( the diaper had a hole for her pink tail to fall through ) and a lavender brush to brush her hair . <p> Next I got Surf Rider , a seahorse with a separate blue fish float with purple fins for maximum bath-time fun . I did n't know then that the first My Little Pony was invented by Bonnie Zacherle , an illustrator employed in research and development at the Hasbro toy company in Rhode Island . Bonnie was the daughter of a military veterinarian . Her interest in horses began when she was only four years old and her father was stationed on a US military base in Japan . <p> One of the animals her father had to care for was a Korean pony -- Bonnie fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own . Maybe she prayed for one . But God and/or her father never delivered . She grew up . At Hasbro one of Bonnie 's responsibilities was to come up with new ideas for toys . Lots of little girls want to own horses but not every little girl can . Bonnie designed the original My Pretty Pony based on a Palomino ; she wanted the toys to look like real horses , but the marketing department suggested the ponies be pink and purple . Marketing won . <p> " Little girls had to put their own personalities into each individual pony , " Bonnie said on a podcast in 2014 . ' " When play is open-ended like that it causes children to have stories of their own ... That 's when it starts to grow and go . " <p> Muriel Fahrion , the illustrator of Strawberry Shortcake , later noticed that the generation of girls who collected Shortcake in the eighties grew up and dyed their hair all kinds of different colours . " I like to think Strawberry Shortcake had something to do with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , going towards your potential and the freedom to have fun and be original . " <p> The poster on the author 's wall in 1982 <p> I lost Apricot on my way to school . She dropped out of my bag . I cried . Apricot was n't just a piece of merchandise . She lived in a village at the foot of my bed overseen by a poster of Olivia Newton-John . But now Olivia and me and the whole cast of plastic toys that were acceptable in the 80s are jammed in time , like videotape , our lives unspooling indiscriminately , our faces munched then crunched and sometimes Botoxed . <p> The My Little Ponies and Strawberry Shortcake dolls have gone through upgrades . Everything retro can be brought back , thinner the second time around . Google the past , and you can trace a path back to the patent and the names attached , but can you ever really meet your maker ? <p> Dear God <p> Please look after Mum and me and keep us safe . <p> Also , when I grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Press play and rewind . <p> Extracted from Things I Learned at Art School by Megan Dunn , published by Penguin Random House NZ . <p> The Spinoff Review of Books is proudly brought to you by Unity Books , recently named 2020 International Book Store of the Year , London Book Fair , and Creative New Zealand .

" They were in a really big hole , " says Wrenn . " They were verging on divorce . Their whole world was ending . " <p> It 's a scenario facing many businesses right now .

" Covid hit , we had all those government subsidies , that 's kept a few of them afloat ... now we do n't have government subsides propping them up anymore . There 's literally nothing left . " <p> That means another kind of epidemic is hitting business owners , Wrenn says . " It is an incredibly tough , challenging market , " she says . " Everyone is trying to do their best but nothing is working .

" Little Joe Bloggs made a dumb decision , or someone did n't pay them , and they 'd end up bankrupt , " she says . She wanted to help save businesses before they got to the point of no return , but that was n't her job , and her hands were tied . " There were things at IRD that I desperately wanted to tell people but could n't . " <p> A heart attack at the age of 37 forced her to make a change .

" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a company that 's due for liquidation and turning it around , " she says . That meant diving into the carpet company 's books , analysing their financial history , examining their personal lives , combing through their spending habits , and setting new goals -- often in intimate detail .

" <p> People can , and should , do this before Wrenn 's services are required . She says the grim economic forecasts could last a good while yet , and that makes it a great time to overhaul any parts of your business that may not be working . " My advice is to batten down the hatches , really think about where you 're spending your money , and protect your cash flow , " she says . " You can have the best business in the world with as many assets as you like but without cash flow , you 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really good business decisions to make sure the money 's going to the right places .

They 're not out of debt , but they 're paying it off at a nice rate and estimate they 'll be doing so for another year . Not only have they saved their house , they 've even managed a holiday , recently travelling to Auckland to attend a Warriors match . <p> Wrenn says sometimes it 's as simple as changing a negative mindset . " When you start thinking , ' This has all happened to me , ' it spirals out of control , " she says . " Let 's focus on what you can do , and do it one step at a time .

@@92752234 <p> Method to identify bucked shin can identify the problem at early stages , allowing the horses to be rested while they recover . Photo by Alan Piper <p> Ultrasound can be used for the early detection of a condition called bucked shin in racehorses , researchers report . <p> When racehorses enter work around two years of age , they can develop tiny stress fractures and new bone formations in their legs . This condition , known as bucked shin , occurs in about 70% of young racehorses , leading to pain and delays in training . <p> Researchers in Japan , writing in The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America , report on their development of a method to screen for bucked shin using ultrasound . <p> Although X-ray radiography can diagnose bucked shin , computed tomography scans and MRIs are necessary to evaluate the severity in detail . These strategies are difficult to use on large animals , especially in the field . Horses require anesthesia and must be lying down . <p> Axial transmission , in which an ultrasound emitter and receiver are placed on the skin to induce and measure wave velocities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The method could detect bucked shin more easily and preserve the health and growth of young horses , the researchers from Doshisha University , Nagasaki University , and the Japan Racing Association Equine Research Institute reported . <p> " If we can identify this disease at early stages , we can stop training for a period of several weeks or have the horses do light training while they recover , " said one of the paper 's authors , Mami Matsukawa , from Doshisha University in Kyoto , Japan . <p> To achieve this , Matsukawa and her team created multiple three-dimensional digital models of a racehorse metacarpal bone with varying degrees of bucked shin . Each was based on computed tomography measurements of a real bone with bucked shin . <p> The researchers simulated ultrasonic wave propagation along the bone model , finding two main wave components with different velocities , one faster and one slower . In the area with bucked shin , the fast waves changed speed dramatically because of irregularities in the bone , while the slow waves were almost unaffected . <p> " We use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bucked shin or not , " Matsukawa said . " In an area with bucked shin , there is a new bone formation . If you touch your leg , most likely it is very smooth and there are no irregularities . But if there was some new bone formation , you would find some irregularities in the shape that change the fast wave speed . " <p> The simulations showed that the larger the area of bucked shin , the more variation in the fast waves . Because the axial transmission technique is already established for humans , translating it to work for horses should not be too difficult a task . In comparison to other methods , such ultrasound devices would be small , compact , easy to carry , and inexpensive . <p> While this study used only the velocity as a diagnostic , the team aims to use other wave characteristics , like the modes and attenuation , to obtain material properties of bone in the future . <p> The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America is published on behalf of the Acoustical Society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

@@92752240 <p> In an interview in arch design magazine Wallpaper , former Apple chief design officer Jonny Ive reminisces on advice given to him by company founder Steve Jobs . He also expresses his anger that much design today does n't work as he and Jobs did at Apple , and is all the poorer for it -- going so far to claim that many products do not deserve to exist . <p> Ive is described in the interview as unfailingly polite , solicitous and considerate but often describes his design process as furious and angry , particularly in relation to design 's response to climate change on which he has been working with Prince Charles , the Prince of Wales . <p> Ive left Apple in 2019 to form his own design consulting firm and recently cut all ties with Apple . However , he still remembers the one word Jobs told him should go into everything he designs : Care . <p> Royal seal of approval <p> As well as being a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire ( KBE ) for the past decade , Ive is a Royal Designer for Industry , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His most recent design is n't quite on the scale of the iPhone : the seal for the Prince of Wales 's Terra Carta campaign , which boasts the motto For Nature , People and Planet . The seal was designed by Ive using a specially drawn Baskerville-derived serif font that he reserves for his personal projects . <p> Based on the famous royal charter of rights the Magna Carta , which was signed under some duress by Prince Charles 's distant relative King John in 1215 , Terra Carta is a mandate that puts sustainability at the heart of the private sector . It is meant as guide for business to avert climate catastrophe in the belief that capitalism and enlightened self-interest are compatible with saving the planet . <p> While all this royal talk sounds archaic , Wallpaper reports that , despite its Latin name , Terra Carta is written in the language of modern management theory , and looks at areas of green investment , such as electric flight , carbon-neutral construction and nuclear fission . <p> Ive is helping Prince Charles advise the four winners of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Initiative to take their projects to market . The two worked together after Ive suggested the forming of a design lab at the Royal College of Art ( RCA ) of which he is chancellor . <p> ' Care ' is key to design <p> For all of his accolades , Ive is filled with anger when discussing design . I am angry that most of what is made seems so thoughtless . So many products do not deserve to exist . The minimum that they should do to justify themselves and consume all that material is that their designers should care about them . <p> We have lost sight of how recent industrialization is . Unlike architecture , design is still a new profession . It is developed by putting a design office on top of a manufacturing plant , then discovered authorship , and is still trying to find how to make sense of the equation . <p> When you design , you must have a thorough understanding of materials , otherwise you get a fractured development of form . ... You often hear people apologising that things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand that excuse , but at Apple I spent months at manufacturing sites , and my apology would have had no currency . <p> He still remembers the time he spent discussing design with Jobs and how one word defined everything he helped make . Steve told me , ' When you make something with care , even though you do n't know who the people using it will be , they will sense it . Care is a way to express our love for the species . ' <p> And Ive still uses that advice today . If it 's designed and made with care , a mass-produced object can have the resonances of a batch production .

They take me to Gina 's on Symonds St , where I ca n't hear a word over the flirting .

@@92795231 <p> In Pierce Brosnan 's 007 debut , GoldenEye - and for the first time in the character 's cinematic history - James Bond went to Russia . Previous adventures had stemmed from Russian chicanery , of course - bushy-eyebrowed Sovietsplotting against the West , or sultry double agents sent to be seduced by Roger Moore - but no Bond film had been shot there until 1995 's GoldenEye . <p> Much had changed since Bond 's last adventure , the Timothy Dalton-starring Licence to Kill , was released in the summer of 1989 . Six years on , the Cold War had ended , the Berlin Wall tumbled down , and the Soviet Union was dissolved . The world in which Bond had operated for decades - the world that necessitated Bond existed at all - was gone , effectively dismantled . Now Bond , returning from a prolonged hiatus , was scrambling to find his place in the post-Cold War world - which he partly did by joyriding a 36-tonne tank through St. Petersburg , smashing through statues , walls , and balustrades . <p> There was some reluctance to send the production to Russia , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days into the second unit filming there , the tank chase hit an administrative blockade . The St. Petersburg authorities suddenly decided that Bond was causing too much damage ( though all destroyed artefacts had been made by the art department ) .

" They shut us down . The mayor wanted to renegotiate - as he put it - now that he understood the extent of what we were really doing . Read into that however you like . But we had a problem . They woke up to realise that they could make more money from us with our tanks running around the streets . " <p> To complete the sequence , St. Petersburg was recreated at Leavesden Studios in Watford , built on old aerodrome runways , so Bond could tear through the streets with little regard for historic buildings . There is a post-Cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Russia saw him retreat back to Blighty . <p> The tank chase is a crunching , muscular showpiece , and punctuated by one of those Bondian moments that made Brosnan a perfect Bond-of-the-moment - pausing post-tank carnage to adjust the tie of his impeccably-worn Brioni suit . <p> " Nobody 's ever seen this - only we have copies , " says screenwriter Bruce Feirstein about the tank chase . " Every beat was written out . Everything - T-junctions and F-functions . It 's an 18-page script unto itself . I remember sitting there with the director Martin Campbell and going , ' Here , here , here , and here - this is how we 're going to do this . ' Even down to where he straightens his tie . " <p> More significantly , it 's one of three action set-pieces - along with an almost 220-metre bungee jump off the Contra Dam in Ticino , Switzerland , and a climactic punch-up at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico , dangling over a 300m dish - that captures the spirited reinvention of GoldenEye , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Advertisement <p> It 's the film that retooled Bond for the Nineties - Bond 's first true reboot - and renewed 007 as an icon of then-modern masculinity : a Bond for the age of Cool Britannia , laddism , Union Jack guitars , and an exuberant , youthful jolt of patriotism . Without the tank-sized , zeitgeist-smashing success of GoldenEye , it 's hard to imagine that Bond would be where he is now . <p> " There was a need to reassess Bond 's place in cinema and culture , " says Kleeman . " And address that within the movie , in a way that I do n't believe that any other Bond has ever done . " But according to Kleeman , production of GoldenEye was also " incredibly nervy " . Even without the St Petersburg mayor . <p> Indeed , it was n't just global politics that had changed in Bond 's six-year hiatus . Five-time director John Glen was let go , replaced by Martin Campbell - a director with zero blockbuster hits to his name ; the Bond distributor , United Artists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Bond guardian , Albert " Cubby " Broccoli , now in declining health , passed the production reins to his daughter and step-son , Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson ; and James Bond was now some fella who we last saw playing second banana to Mrs Doubtfire . <p> Uncertainty over Bond 's future went back to Licence to Kill . Even 007 himself thought his number was up . " My feeling is this will be the last one , " said Timothy Dalton during an on-set interview , ostensibly intended to promote Licence to Kill as the next blockbuster . " I do n't mean my last one . I mean the end of the whole lot . " <p> Attempts were made to get another Dalton film off the ground - the beginnings of what ultimately became GoldenEye - but Bond was held up by behind-the-scenes drama : the frequently-changing ownership of United Artists ' parent company , MGM ; legal wrangling over Bond 's international distribution ; and the potential sale of Cubby Broccoli 's company , Danjaq , which owned the Bond film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( non-pandemic-forced ) break between Bond films . <p> During the hiatus , MGM/UA brought in new management , including the legendary producer and executive , John Calley , who was lured out of retirement to get the studio in shape for yet another sale . Kleeman , formerly at Paramount , came in to meet with Calley . " I 'd kill to work on a Bond film , " Kleeman told him . " I was Bond obsessed ! " Kleeman says . <p> But Dalton was closer to the truth than fans might realise . " John hired me , " says Kleeman . " Then I discovered there was no desire at all from the studio to make a Bond film . Bond was absolutely not on the books . " <p> It was n't a cat-stroking lunatic that almost killed Bond . Not sniffy executives , nor a laser beam up the Double-0s . Not even Dalton 's curmudgeonly catastrophising . It was the disinterested teenage boys . With the new administration in place at MGM/UA , audience research was carried out . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Kleeman , " was that every single teenage boy in America either had no idea who James Bond was , or they referred to James Bond as , ' Oh , that guy my dad watches on TV sometimes . ' It was the kiss of death . " <h> Advertisement <p> Teenage boys were a key demographic for action cinema . The genre itself - with an influx of hi-tech , CG-powered mega-hits , such as Terminator 2 and Jurassic Park - had left 007 in the dust . <p> ( Teenage boys were largely won over by the GoldenEye N64 video game , a phenomenon itself . The game was so popular that a new documentary , GoldenEra , explores its production and impact . " When I meet people of a certain age and tell them I worked on GoldenEye , they 're so excited , " says Feirstein . " Until they realise that I did n't write the game . " ) <p> Calley and Kleeman fought for Bond . " We went to studio boss Frank Mancuso and said , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under any constraints . Tell us how much you 'd be willing to gamble on Bond and we 'll make it work for that price . ' He said , ' OK , I 'll give you $49 million . ' That was the number . " <p> Batman Forever - released that same year , and perhaps the closest equivalent in terms of intellectual property and franchise appeal - cost double . <p> One problem for the higher-ups was the incumbent Bond , Timothy Dalton . His films have aged tremendously , more in line with the grit of Daniel Craig , but Dalton was the dads ' James Bond . " With all due respect to Timothy , " says producer Waye , " and as good an actor as he is , I think he was a bit old-time . " Licence to Kill had also been a box office disappointment , overpowered by summer blockbusters . The Broccolis wanted Dalton but the studio did n't . <p> Other potential actors were in the mix , including Liam Neeson , Ralph Fiennes , and Mel Gibson - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and more , " says Kleeman . " We also talked about Timothy . We had a big meeting with Barbara , Michael and Cubby , where they made the case for Timothy . Everybody , in essence , got a day in court . " <p> Pierce Brosnan had almost clinched the role years earlier , but was tied up by his TV series , Remington Steele . Waye , who worked across multiple Bonds , thought Brosnan was n't ready the first time around . " I remember when we tested Pierce , " says Waye . " He still had the Remington Steele look - quite young and long hair . When we came to do GoldenEye , he had matured . " <p> Kleeman remembers a meeting in Calley 's office to decide who would be the next James Bond . " We were debating it passionately , " he says . " Cubby , in my memory - which I think is correct - had a walking stick . At one point he thumped the floor with it . Everybody turned . He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Broccolis informed Dalton of the bad news , and Dalton graciously stepped down . Brosnan remembered getting the phone call from his agent , informing him that he was James Bond - but not to tell anyone . Brosnan agreed while mouthing to his wife , " I 'm f*****g James Bond ! " <p> Famke Janssen as Xenia Onatopp grips Brosnan 's Bond . Photo / Alamy <p> " Pierce Brosnan was born to play Bond , " says Matthew Field , co-author of the Bond film history , Some Kind of Hero . " Pierce played to audiences ' expectations . He looked like Bond . He dressed like Bond and he had all the sophistication and charm . " <p> Brosnan does look tailor-made for 007 . He 's a Bond created within the context and knowledge of the series , playing off all the Bonds who came before , manifesting as the complete - but contemporary - Bond package . It 's all there : that intangible Connery-like quality that treads between suave and rugged ; the occasional glimpses of vulnerability or darkness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the mighty Roger Moore - the knack for handling a double-entendre whenever the moment calls for it . One rises to meet a challenge . <p> Brosnan , however , was n't a sure thing . By the time GoldenEye had rolled around , Brosnan was playing supporting roles in family comedies and romances . " To my mind he was the perfect actor , " says Kleeman . " But from an internal studio and industry perspective - when there was Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes and Mel Gibson out there - it was , ' You 're going with the cheesy actor who 's the straight man in Mrs Doubtfire ? ' " <p> Kleeman says similar about director Martin Campbell , who had n't yet made a major film ( though he 'd made some excellent television , including the British miniseries , Edge of Darkness ) . Interestingly , Campbell would successfully reboot Bond twice - GoldenEye in 1995 and Casino Royale in 2006 - astutely tapping into the cultural moment each time . <p> Campbell wanted to begin the film with the stunning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's second only to the 2.1km ski parachute jump from The Spy Who Loved Me . <p> The bungee jump was performed ( twice ) by stuntman Wayne Michaels .

It was the most enormous , gigantic piece of engineering , quite awe-inspiring . A lot of really burly tough riggers looked at it and said , ' F*** that ! ' " <p> " The guts of that guy jumping over on that rope ! " says producer Waye . " It was just tremendous ... we could only test the rope so much . " <p> The story sees Bond uncover a plot by the former 006 , Alec Trevelyan ( Sean Bean ) , and some disgruntled Soviet types , who plan to use the space laser weapon GoldenEye ( named after Bond creator Ian Fleming 's estate in Jamaica ) to hit London and steal bank records . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Georgian fighter pilot who orgasms by squeezing men to death with her vice-like thighs ( better than being bitten to death by Jaws , at least ) , and Robbie Coltrane , playing dodgy Russian gangster Zukovsky . <p> The initial script for GoldenEye was written by Michael France , but was unpopular with the studio 's top brass . " It was a step backwards from where we wanted to be , " says Kleeman . Other writers wrote subsequent drafts - first Jeffrey Caine and then Feirstein . " They asked me if I 'd like to punch it up and add some ' wit ' , " says Feirstein . " Very quickly , I realised that the script needed to be superimposed with an idea . It needed a conceit - that the world has changed but Bond has n't . Every scene is about that . " <p> Bond certainly needed a Nineties debrief .

We do n't have to worry about ' Nineties sensibility ! ' Which , by the way , is a fair argument . " <p> But modern Bond is always at his most interesting when reflecting on himself and his relevance : in Casino Royale , breaking down the elements of what makes him 007 ; in Skyfall , reassembling the pieces and wondering if he still has a place in the world ; and in GoldenEye , dealing with a changing politics - in the war room and bedroom - and being a " relic of the Cold War " . <p> On the opposite side of GoldenEye stands Sean Bean 's Alec Trevelyan .

" I might as well ask you if all the vodka martinis ever silenced the screams of all the men you killed , " says Trevelyan to Bond in one standoff . " Or if you find forgiveness in the arms of all those willing women ... for all the dead ones you failed to protect . " <p> Indeed , Bond 's well-earned , decades-long womanising was , according to Kleeman , a " very thorny " issue to contend with .

But it soon wo n't be a farm anymore . <p> The land 's owner , John Hindrup , who bought it in 2013 for $1.8 million , sold it this year for 13 million . His windfall came courtesy of a newly lucrative industry in New Zealand : Forestry investors will cover the property in trees , making money not from their timber , but from the carbon the trees will suck from the atmosphere . <p> " If you told me this two years ago , I would n't have believed you , " Hindrup , 67 , said of the land 's skyrocketing value . <p> So-called carbon farming has become a key element of New Zealand 's drive to be carbon neutral by 2050 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carbon-intensive industries must buy credits to offset their emissions . Many of those credits are purchased from forest owners , and as the credits ' price has soared , forestry investors have sought to cash in by buying up farms . <p> The emissions trading programme is New Zealand 's most powerful tool to reduce greenhouse gases . But the loss of farm land to carbon farming could threaten one of the most iconic industries and change the face of idyllic rural areas . Farmers and agriculture experts have voiced concerns that sheep and cattle farming , a major employer in many communities and one of the country 's top exporting sectors , is bound for a significant decline . <p> " We 're talking about a land-use transformation beyond anything that we have seen probably in the last 100 years , " said Keith Woodford , an honorary professor of agriculture and food systems at Lincoln University in New Zealand who is also an industry consultant . " It is a big change in land use , and we just need to be sure that is what we want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programme is the only one in the world that allows companies to offset 100 per cent of their emissions through forestry .

The agriculture sector is New Zealand 's largest emitter of greenhouse gases , largely through methane released by animals . <p> Today 's policy decisions , in response to the long road ahead in addressing climate change , are essentially locking in land use for decades , Woodford said . Permanent carbon forests must remain planted with trees , and timber forestry that earns carbon credits is required to replant trees after they are harvested -- typically at Year 28 -- or face a financial penalty . <p> Already , the amount of farm land sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales to foreign buyers from places like Australia , Malaysia and the United States . In 2017 , the beef and sheep farms sold in their entirety for forestry totalled about 10,000 acres , according to a report commissioned by Beef + Lamb New Zealand , an industry group . Two years later , the figure was 90,000 , and while sales dipped early in the pandemic , they are expected to have risen in 2021 . <p> The land sales have grown as the price of carbon credits has tripled in the last three years , reaching $80 . The increase reflects an imbalance between supply and demand in credits as New Zealand 's emissions remain heavy , as well as the influence of speculators who expect carbon credit prices to continue to rise as the country faces the need to further tighten climate policies to achieve its pledges . <p> At current prices , credits can generate carbon farming revenue of upward of $1,000 an acre annually , compared with about $160 for sheep and beef farms . <p> David Hall , a climate change policy researcher at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credits was likely to pass $100 in the next few years , but that a price of over$ 200 would be required to prompt changes in the transportation sector that are necessary to meet the carbon-neutral goal . <p> Just how many trees New Zealand needs to meet that pledge is unclear . It will depend partly on how quickly the country transforms into a low-emissions economy , with technological advances reducing the need for carbon farming . <h> Advertisement <p> Under current projections , the country 's Climate Change Commission put the figure at 2.7 million acres of carbon forests by 2050 , but other modelling saw a need for more than 13 million acres , about 70 per cent of the area occupied by sheep and beef farms in New Zealand . <p> Shaving 2.7 million acres off the sheep and beef sector could translate to a loss of $2 billion a year in exports , Woodford said . Meat and wool are New Zealand 's second-largest export category , totalling about$12 billion , or 15 per cent of total exports . <p> With no obvious industry to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under downward pressure , eventually increasing import costs for New Zealanders , Woodford said .

Photo / Mark Mitchel <p> For rural communities , carbon farming risks creating " green deserts " of trees that generate few jobs . Permanent carbon forestry provides about one job a year per 2,500 acres after planting , according to a report from Te Uru Rakau , New Zealand 's forestry department . Timber forestry generates dozens of jobs during planting and harvesting but little for the almost three decades in between . Beef and sheep farming provides regular and seasonal employment of about 13 full-time jobs per 2,500 acres . <p> Horehore Station , the farm that was recently sold , employed three people full time and many others part time , such as shearers , fencers and helicopter pilots , Hindrup said .

The government has considered rule changes that would take some of the heat out of rural land sales -- and address concerns about carbon farming 's potential harm to biodiversity -- but backed off in the face of opposition from Maori landowners .

Some are planting their own properties in trees . Others are pulling an income from both cattle and carbon by turning underutilised farm areas , like erosion-prone gullies , into forests . <p> Niven Winchester , an economics professor at Auckland University of Technology , said the parts of the economy that contributed significant amounts of greenhouse gases , like agriculture , should be reduced . <p> " We as a society have to do something about climate change , " Winchester said , " and it is going to be costly .

@@92855231 <h> A dozen things I learned at a Waiheke Island dolphin stranding <p> First person - Being part of the successful rescue of eight dolphins stranded at Whakanewha on Waiheke Island last Friday gave me a hands-on chance to learn how to care for beached dolphins . Here are a dozen things I learned . <p> Rose Davis ( in blue wetsuit ) helps the dolphin she named Bonny as she enters the sea . Another one she cared for and named Angel is seen in the foreground . Photo : Jaimie Wilkie <h> It 's not a time to take selfies <p> - The first thing I learnt is it 's a harrowing scene . Arriving at Whakanewha on 12 August , the vast expanse of sand was dotted with nine sleek , dark shapes that could barely move . Babies and youngsters made up a significant number of the stranded common dolphins . <p> When I spotted two uncovered dolphins , I waded down the muddy beach and soaked two towels in shallow pools . I draped a wet towel gently over the nearest dolphin . Its lack of movement chilled me . Death had come fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my eyes , only to find a tiny baby dolphin lying lifeless on the sand . <p> I abandoned my towels and walked further , finding two young dolphins hanging onto life about 30 metres away . Two women were quietly trickling water from buckets over them and I joined them at about 11.30am . <p> As the day wore on , more people gathered . Some came to help but some just came to see the dolphins . A stranding is n't the right day to admire dolphins or to take selfies or gather likes on your livestream . It 's a day of tragedy and suffering where quiet help is needed . <h> Bring cotton sheets <p> The young dolphin I spent most of the day caring for was draped in a wet sack and a thermal-backed curtain when I arrived . I sensed its relief when I peeled these off and poured water over its skin . I learned from the experts that rough fabrics are too scratchy and artificial fibres can stick to their drying skin . Wet towels are also too heavy for a marine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the sand . <p> A cotton sheet proved the perfect light-weight fabric to drape over the dolphins to stop sunburn . <h> Bring buckets <p> One of the most beautiful aspects of the day was watching a long line of people form a chain of bucket bearers . Some stood in the cold sea for hours , filling heavy buckets with fresh seawater . These were passed from one pair of caring hands to the next so the island community could provide a steady supply of water for us to pour over the dolphins and keep their skin moist . <p> At one stage , I started trying to use all the water supplied . An expert told me to slow down , because even having water gently poured over them increases the dolphins ' stress levels . They only need wetting once every few minutes . <p> Photo : Supplied / Project Jonah <h> Never pour water in a dolphins ' blowhole <p> We were instructed to wet the dolphin 's bodies , but avoid pouring any water over their blowholes or heads . Even a tiny trickle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realised it 's like having water poured up your nose - you do n't want anything entering the holes you breathe through and neither does a dolphin . <p> Later , an expert taught us to wait until immediately after the dolphin had breathed out through its blowhole , then quickly splash water over its head . This helped keep it cool , washed sand from its eyes , and rinsed away the clear mucus that was welling up around its eyes on dry land . <h> Do n't move stranded dolphins <p> Trying to lift or drag a dolphin can cause physical harm . They can survive for 12 hours or more on the sand , so it 's best to leave them where they are . <h> Dig around them <p> Carefully dig out the sand around the dolphin .

Bonny started flapping and twisting around , giving non-verbal signals that she was in pain and needed to be moved off the side she had been lying on for hours . With expert help , we rolled her gently so she was lying flat on her belly with both dorsal fins free . <h> Talk to them <p> Bonny would jerk her head and slap her tail every time I walked past to get buckets of water for Angel . I learned to say " it 's only me " , before I entered Bonny 's space , a verbal cue that stopped her panicking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Angel all day . It was impossible not to admire her beauty and strength and joy . Her suffering was so tangible , I could n't help but offer her the only words I had , in a language she obviously does n't speak .

Bonny made sounds and Angel showed signs of listening closely for signs her mate was okay and responding when she heard her . <p> Eight of the 10 dolphins which stranded were refloated and appear to have survived . Photo : Supplied / Project Jonah <h> Stay calm or stay away <p> Dolphins are probably more sensitive than most people .

Looking after the dolphins meant asking people to stop talking loudly and noisily banging buckets together . Pouring water from one bucket to another also seemed a bad idea , as Bonny seemed to get more agitated - possibly hearing the sound of water increased her desperation to dive into the sea . <p> Someone placed orange cones and sacks in a circle , marking out the space the dolphins needed . This definitely helped . <p> Red algae appeared on Saturday morning at Whakanewha , where the dolphins had stranded on Friday . Photo : ROSE DAVIS <h> Be prepared to get attached <p> After an hour helping look after Angel , I cared about her as though she was a sister . Her kind , joyful gaze amazed me every time I paused to look into her eye .

Bonny bucked her head up to breathe as waves started to lap over her head , but stayed on the sand until the water covered her thoroughly . She had seemed healthy and active all day , despite the period where she had seemed in pain lying on her side . She swam away so strongly , I had little doubt she had survived her ordeal in fine form . <p> Angel sank . I cried out when she went down .

An adult and a baby dolphin died and the cause of their death is being investigated by researchers from Massey University , before their bodies are returned to Whakanewha for burial . <p> Red algae bloomed at Whakanewha and other bays on Waiheke Island on Saturday morning and samples of the algae have been collected for analysis .

Low levels of health literacy in the country are a significant reason for why hospitalisation rates for chronic conditions such as asthma are so high . <p> Asthma New Zealand CEO Katheren Leitner says she 's keen to harness technology to extend the organisation 's reach , enabling it to accelerate its path to achieving reductions in hospitalisations . <p> Patient education is the key to effective asthma management , technology provides a powerful platform to do this . Patients who complete Asthma NZ 's 3-Plus Self-Management Programme are 87 percent less likely to be re-admitted to the ER room for respiratory related problems and are 61 percent less reliant on reliever mediation . <p> " I realised quickly after joining Asthma New Zealand that we can never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leitner says . " Humans , as important as they are , are n't enough . We have to develop our triage systems , and that involves using technology . " <h> Beyond technology <p> While Asthma New Zealand is eyeing up a future harnessing advanced technologies including , conversational artificial intelligence , gamification and more integrated systems , the first step for the organisation has been deploying a new customer relationship management system to enable nurses to collect information more effectively when with patients and increase their productivity . <p> In the past nurses recorded information manually while with patients in their homes or out in the community , returning to the office to enter it into an old Access database , which acted as a data repository with little facility for extracting and using that data to show trends and make decisions . <p> Using Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM nurses can now enter data directly into smart devices -- and the CRM -- while talking to patients in the community . <p> " Ultimately we want to enable patients at times to be able to enter their data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records , " Leitner says . " A lot of higher risk or higher needs community have an innate distrust of the health system , and enabling them to be involved with the data helps in terms of the relationship and trust because they can see exactly what is entered about them . " <p> Leitner notes the system has already resulted in an improvement in the completeness and quality of the data collected . <h> The Exponential path to extending Asthma NZ 's reach <p> While the CRM is the first technology deployed under the new partnership with Quanton , Asthma New Zealand has also been working with Quanton 's Operational Excellence Practice to develop a ' plan on a page ' . <p> Asthma New Zealand worked with Quanton on Exponential thinking , to approach the problem differently rather than traditional linear approaches . A plan was formed that would enable Asthma New Zealand to make the quantum leap it desired , become an ' exponential organisation ' and have a greatly amplified positive health impact . <p> Ravi Kulatunga , Quanton Operational Excellence Practice Lead says " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's really important to get your business models and your people right . One of the key things for digitisation is the availability and access to data to make informed decisions around what technologies you are going to use . That is what has come out of working with Asthma New Zealand so they can start to look further ahead . " <p> The future technologies Asthma New Zealand are keen to harness will rely heavily on access to data to facilitate more productive ways of working making the deployment of the CRM a crucial first technology step . <p> " It gives them good foundation to be able to scale up now and in the future , " says John Che , Customer Success Manager at Quanton . " If we want to utilise artificial intelligence , machine learning , conversational AI or a patient or doctor portal , they have a very good foundation for all of those future integrations .

The decline in adolescent mental health was underway before the pandemic ; now it is a full-blown crisis , affecting young people across economic , racial and gender lines . <p> The trend has coincided with teenagers spending a growing amount of time online , and social media is commonly blamed for the crisis . In a widely covered study in 2021 first reported by The Wall Street Journal , Meta ( formerly Facebook ) found that 40 per cent of girls on Instagram , which Meta owns , reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platform . <p> C , now 22 , has been on social media since the age of 10 . Photo / Annie Flanagan , The New York Times <p> But there is a lack of reliable research into how technology affects the brain , and a shortage of funding to help ailing teens cope . From 2005 to 2015 , funding from the National Institute of Mental Health to study innovative ways to understand and help adolescents with mental health issues fell 42 per cent . <p> " The federal funding , or lack thereof , has contributed enormously to the place we 're at , " said Kimberly Hoagwood , a child and adolescent psychiatrist at NYU Langone Health and former associate director for child and adolescent mental health research at the NIMH . " We 've sort of put our blinders on . " <p> But there are powerful clues , experts said . They widely posit that heavy technology use is interacting with a key biological factor : the onset of puberty , which is happening earlier than ever . Puberty makes adolescents highly sensitive to social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends , where they fit in . Adults face the same onslaught , but pubescent teens encounter it before other parts of the brain have fully developed to handle it . <p> " On a content level , and on a process level , it makes your head explode , " said Stephen Hinshaw , a psychologist at the University of California , Berkeley . " You want to make it stop -- cutting yourself , burning , mutilation and suicide attempts . " <p> The ability of youths to cope has been further eroded by declines in sleep , exercise and in-person connection , which all have fallen as screen time has gone up . Young people , despite vast virtual connections , or maybe because of them , report being lonelier than any other generation . And many studies have found that adolescents who spend more time online are less happy . <h> Advertisement <p> Still , many questions remain . This is partly because the internet experience is so vast and varied , health experts say , which makes it hard to generalise about how screen time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and depression . <p> " That does n't mean there 's not a relationship , " Reeves said . " There are so many effects that are totally idiosyncratic to individual kids . " He added : " Each of their experiences are so radically different . " <h> An outside connection <p> C grew up in an upper-middle-class family and displayed a gift for music from an early age . An uncle remembered C at age 8 playing a flawless F ? r Elise on piano , with a bubbly Shirley Temple vibe . " An incredible talent . We were thinking Juilliard , " he said . <p> Mental health challenges ran in C 's family . In third grade , C began obsessively digging a pencil into one leg . Shortly after , puberty hit -- " crazy early , " C recalled . " I was still in elementary school and suddenly my brain is , you know , working like 20 times faster on the dark stuff . " <p> At 10 , C joined Mini Nation , a virtual community where they hoped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't tell their parents , fearing they would take away the iPod . " It was my connection to the outside world , " C said . <p> The cutting intensified . " Self-harm was like a smoke break , " C said . " I would do it , watch a little YouTube , take a break , knife , come back . " <p> C performed at an outdoor gathering in Salt Lake City last autumn . They displayed a gift for music from an early age . Photo / Annie Flanagan , The New York Times <p> After classmates told a school counsellor about the wounds on C 's arms , C spent a week in a psychiatric hospital , was prescribed Zoloft and was sent home . <p> C 's family moved to Utah , hoping for a fresh start . But the challenges plaguing C could be found everywhere . From 2007 to 2016 , emergency room visits for people ages 5-17 rose 117 per cent for anxiety disorders , 44 per cent for mood disorders and 40 per cent for attention disorders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , published in Psediatrics in 2020 , found that visits for deliberate self-harm rose 329 per cent . But visits for alcohol-related problems dropped 39 per cent , reflecting the change in the kind of public health risks posed to teenagers . <p> In the same period , the use of personal electronic devices exploded . In 2005 , 45 per cent of teens had phones ; by 2010 , 75 per cent did ; and by 2018 , 95 per cent did -- nearly half of whom reported being online " almost constantly . " Online time rose further during the pandemic . <p> Dr. Karen Manotas , a child and adolescent psychiatrist at the University of Utah , said social media sometimes seemed to play a role in the adolescent mental health cases she handled . In September , Manotas treated a 15-year-old boy in the hospital who had attempted suicide after learning of his girlfriend 's infidelity . When he decided to forgive her , the boy 's friends turned on him with " an online group text chat about him being a sucker . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand how exactly social media affects mental health . Photo / Annie Flanagan , The New York Times <p> Around that time , Manotas was seeing a 15-year-old girl predisposed to anxiety and depression who had developed a tic disorder , yelling out noises in public and turning her neck obsessively . The girl , Manotas learned , had identified closely with " TikTok influencers " whose tic disorders the girl seemed to adopt to perfection . " It was the exact neck tic this girl presented with , " Manotas said . " I was floored . " <p> Manotas noted that the girl 's tics were expressed in some circumstances but not others , and she ultimately concluded that the girl had been influenced by social contagion . ( The girl subsequently sought care in an inpatient setting , and Manotas did not know how her condition resolved . ) <p> " It 's like this sense of belonging and community that does n't really exist but they believe that it does , " Manotas said . " A lot of kids and teens are resorting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who they are . " <h> ' A double whammy ' <p> Since 1900 , the average age of the onset of puberty for girls has fallen to 12 from 14 , a shift that health experts attribute in part to improvements in nutrition . ( Puberty occurs about a year later for boys than for girls , and its onset has fallen , too . ) In puberty , the brain is flooded with hormones and other neurochemicals that , among other things , render a young adolescent more sensitive to changes in social cues , according to brain-imaging research by Andrew Meltzoff , co-director of the University of Washington Institute for Learning and Brain Sciences . <p> But the regions of the brain responsible for self-regulation do not develop any faster or earlier than before . Psychosocial maturity -- a person 's ability to exercise self-restraint in emotional situations -- does not fully mature until the 20s , according to a 2019 paper published by the American Psychological Association that drew on research involving 5,000 teens from 11 countries . <p> Now , the combination of early puberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can lead to " anxiety and depression when people feel a lack of control , " Meltzoff said . <p> Researchers have been framing the issue around a particular set of questions : Is social media to blame for the rise in adolescent emotional distress ? Is this a problem associated with consuming one type of information ? <p> Song lyrics on C 's phone during a rehearsal with their band . Photo / Annie Flanagan , The New York Times <p> The results of numerous studies are conflicting , with some finding that heavy use of social media is associated with depressive symptoms and others finding little or no connection . <p> A 2018 study of lesbian , gay and bisexual teens found that social media was a double-edged sword , opening up new support networks but also exposing adolescents to animosity . " There are literally thousands of hate messages in an instant , " said Gary Harper , a professor of behavioural health at the University of Michigan . <p> At the same time , he said , social media also provides validation and community : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be , that affirms diverse identities . " He added : " But your brain needs to develop enough to sort through all that information . " <p> A 2019 study in the Netherlands reached a similarly equivocal conclusion . Over three weeks , the researchers asked 353 adolescents to report six times a day how often they had browsed Instagram and Snapchat in the past hour and to note how they had felt in that time and at the moment of reporting . Twenty per cent of teens who used their phones to access social media said they felt worse -- but 17 per cent reported that their mood had improved . <p> The most reliable conclusion , researchers say , is that some teens are more vulnerable than others . <p> " Children can react very differently , " said Patti Valkenburg , founder and director of Center for Research on Children , Adolescents and the Media at the University of Amsterdam , and co-author of the Dutch study . For instance , when they encounter people online who appear successful , " some can be envious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Sleep and other factors <p> Absent clear answers , some researchers have begun to reframe the core question : not how much screen time is too much , but which activities known to be healthful might screen time be displacing ? <p> These activities include sleep , time spent with family and friends , and time spent outdoors and being physical . Sleep looms particularly large . In 2020 , a multiyear study involving nearly 4,800 teens found a close relationship between poor sleep and mental health issues . Participants with a diagnosis of depression got less than 7 1/2 hours of sleep per night , compared with the eight to 10 hours recommended by the National Sleep Foundation for people ages 14-17 . <p> Poor sleep is a " fork in the road , where a teen 's mental health can deteriorate if not treated , " Michael Gradisar , a clinical child psychologist at Flinders University in Australia , said in a news release accompanying the study . <p> A shortage of sleep makes it even harder for the brain to regulate and process emotional challenges , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enforce a no-device policy for an hour before bedtime and that they redirect young people to in-person , outdoor activities during the day . <p> Dr. Kara Bagot , a child and adolescent psychiatrist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai , noted that ample research showed the benefits of rest , exercise , imaginative and in-person play , whereas the impact of heavy screen time was uncertain . " We do n't know what can happen , and childhood is such an important developmental period for brain development , for social development , " Bagot said . <p> That uncertainty , she added , results in part from the " huge mismatch " between the billions of dollars spent by tech companies to attract users and the modest funding available to researchers such as her to study the impact . " It 's only going to get worse , " she said . " The tech keeps getting better and more advanced over time , and more engaging . " <p> Major research efforts , such as the federally funded Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youths in the United States and includes questionnaires , behavioural studies and expansive neuroimaging to understand brain development and function . The study began in 2015 with an emphasis on substance abuse but has grown to trying to understand the impact of screen time . <p> Gordon , director of the NIMH , said the government wanted more research but was not receiving enough funding applications from scientists . <p> " There 's not enough psychiatric care , not enough social workers to treat kids , " he said . " Even worse than that is the shortage of child mental health researchers . It 's a real problem . " <p> Two decades ago , public service campaigns encouraged adolescents to " just say no " to drugs , to practice safe sex and to find a designated driver . Today 's health experts are having a harder time offering adolescents such as C reliable , hard-and-fast guidelines for handling screen time and social media , said Hoagwood , the former associate director at the NIMH : " We ca n't just tell her she should n't have spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be OK . " <h> A stage of their own <p> In July , C stood at the edge of a music stage in Denver , rings in each nostril and dark makeup expertly drawn to resemble a cat 's eyes . <p> After years of pain and self-discovery , C 's relationship to the internet underwent a dramatic shift . There was an eating disorder , more cutting , the pressure of school , the agonising pain of depression . <p> At 15 , C was hospitalised for a week , and at 18 for longer . <p> " How would you believe it 's going to get better when you 're growing into your adult brain but still treated like a child ? " C said . " And you have depression . It 's like , wow , this is it , this is what 's waiting for me -- cool , I 'm out , I want to die . " <p> C at home their partner .

The role of the asset owner is to meet those standards knowing that real and effective enforcement will occur if the owner does not . <p> " This creates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reform water services delivery but which allows local approaches to local issues within the broader national regulatory umbrella . For this reason , we support the Government 's changes to the broader regulatory regime . " <p> One of the major findings in the work done by C4LD is that the massive transition costs required in the setting up and running of the four entity model is unnecessary and a significant waste of money . <p> " Castalia 's modelling for us shows that capital expenditure in the sector is actually financeable for the next 20 years , and beyond that with only the most modest of price increases . <p> " Accordingly , the four mega entity , " balance sheet separation " is simply not necessary . Other structural alternatives do exist and would effectively address the core problem .

When times are tough , communities want to see a local face who knows and understands them -- not an unknown and distant bureaucrat . <p> " It is our view there is a better and more durable way to deliver Three Waters reform than the model contained in the Bill . C4LD considers the alternative approach outlined in some detail in our submission is the way to do this . We ask the Government and the Select Committee to consider this seriously . <p> " It 's not too late to turn this issue around , for the Government to genuinely partner with councils and communities to achieve reform that everyone can agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could achieve bipartisan political support .

" <p> She said radiata , in contrast , was often planted surrounded by landscapes that were less vulnerable to invasions , such as highly managed landscapes , farmland with high stocking densities , or native forest . <p> Based on what the authors illustrate , Dr Wyse said radiata certainly had the ability to pose a threat to vulnerable habitats such as sand dunes , gumlands , geothermal communities and systems in the early stages of forest successions ( eg following a fire or other disturbance ) if they were nearby . <p> " As the authors highlight , radiata is structurally and functionally very different from the native plants of the ecosystems or successional stages that it invades , and it is therefore likely to have considerable effects on the ecosystems and future forest successions . <p> " The work is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation . " <p> Dr Wyse said due to the nature of the modelling , which uses occurrence records of where the species has been recorded , they can not overestimate suitable habitat , but are likely to underestimate it if locations where the species is present simply have n't been documented . <p> " Likewise , there may be other ecosystems impacted by radiata that have not yet been documented . <p> " I hope this work will encourage recognition that radiata is an invasive species in New Zealand , and that care and consideration needs to be given to the landscapes where it is planted . <p> " If we are to expand our radiata plantations , particularly for carbon sequestration , we need to be very mindful of the threats posed by the species to vulnerable ecosystems , " Dr Wyse said .

" <p> " When you join they take your name and any connection you have . My name Maryanne Green is linked to two of my aunties . " <p> The first screening in Gisborne at the Dome was like a big family gathering compared to the other screenings around the country . <p> Sharon has missed out on whanau hui for birthdays , Christmas and other celebrations . <p> " It feels amazing to be here . " <p> Sharon 's story with Gloriavale starts in the 1960s when Neville Cooper , who would later be renamed Hopeful Christian and create Gloriavale , visited Ruatoria on the East Coast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " One day Neville Cooper came to Ruatoria and set up his ' Voice of Deliverance ' tent for a whole week .

I wanted my mother in my life . I wanted my siblings too . It felt like everything was breaking up at that point , " Sharon said . <p> However , Sharon says her life at this time in the community was like any other average New Zealander . <p> " My husband had his own job , we had our own bank accounts , our own houses .

" <p> Sharon saids he did not read it . Neither did her husband , even though the first line of the declaration said that " you have read , studied and understood what you are signing up to " . <p> Her eldest son , John Ready , and his sister , Virginia Courage , are in the documentary . <p> Sharon lives in an aircraft hangar a small distance away from the main buildings . <p> " After my husband left because they would n't talk about the issues he had , I had to figure out where to live .

This is what 's happened . Everyone in Wellington has known for years that Paul Eagle was considering running for Wellington Mayor . So at the last government elections in 2020 , he was challenged on that . Why was he running for parliament if he was n't planning on being there for the whole term ? If he was just going to quit after a couple of years and force a by election which will cost the whole country $1.2m-odd and then go off to be the mayor . So the media asked him and he dodged the question and they pushed him and finally he ruled it out . He said " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now he 's doing exactly what he said he 'd ruled out . He 's running for Mayor . And good on the media for drawing attention to this . Because now Paul Eagle is costing taxpayers a lot of money , potentially two years of a MP 's salary for a job that just tided him over , and then the cost of a by election if he wins the Mayoral race . <p> Now you might wonder why this matters , given politicians break their word all the time . But that 's the exactly the problem , they should n't do it . <p> Labour- 2017 election , no new taxes then they bring in the Auckland fuel tax . And again last election , no new taxes but then they bring in the ute tax , the landlord tax , the amazon tax , they try on the retirement tax and duty 's planning and the unemployment tax .

That 's BS , because Wellingtons ' been going backwards for years and we all knew two years that he was going to run for Mayor . Nothing much has changed between then and now . I reckon he just worried that if he fessed up and told the truth , he risked doing badly in the Rongotai electorate . <p> Ahead of an election the only thing we can rely on is the word of a politician . Their promise , it 's all we 've got . So they have to be honest . They have to keep their word . And if they do n't , we can not reward them for breaking it . <p> The Wellington Mayoral race is awful . It 's talentless . But I would rather vote for no one than vote for someone who breaks their word . Because is that really what you ( A ) want in your mayor and ( B ) want to reward ?

@@93337236 <h> Are workers really quiet quitting ? Or are they just putting their wellbeing first ? <p> Feeling exhausted by work ? You are not alone . Photo by Kinga Cichewicz on Unsplash <p> It appears to be the new workplace trend . Everyone , it seems , is suddenly talking about quiet quitting . <p> Quiet quitting is the idea that workers should n't worry about going above and beyond , should n't work overtime or additional hours , or push to get something done if that means doing more than what 's in the job description or outside of regular work hours , and instead workers should do what it takes to meet expectations -- and that 's it . <p> What does quiet quitting look like ? It could mean turning off notifications and putting your phone on ' do not disturb ' after 5pm , ignoring calls or emails and leaving the office as soon as your rostered day is done . <p> In 2022 there has been an explosion of interest in the term , with articles and think-pieces going through the pros and cons of employees deciding to just not do more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It seems from internet sleuthing that the trend can be traced back to articles first published in March this year about " coasting culture " , discussing the idea that rather than joining the great resignation where workers chuck their demanding jobs , you can instead choose to just do enough to get by and keep getting paid . <p> While coasting can easily be dismissed as employee laziness , " a BBC story said , " it often arises out of deeper underlying issues at a company : from a missed promotion , to feeling their contribution is n't being met with adequate reward . " <p> And there is data to show that coasting resonates with employees - a CNBC survey found 39% of those surveyed described themselves as coasting . A Gallup survey published in January reported that US employees ' engagement dropped for the first time in a decade , and about half of workers said they were neither engaged , nor disengaged at work . <p> But some are n't calling it quiet quitting at all . <p> " Act your wage " is often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly in lower waged sectors . <p> One meme swapped out quiet quitting for " inflation adjusted effort " , giving a nod to the spiralling cost of living and wages not keeping pace . <p> And for many unionists , there is absolutely nothing new about it except the terminology . <p> Work to rule looks a lot like quiet quitting . Work to rule means working exactly to the rule book ; you do the minimum outlined in your contract , and that 's it . It 's considered a step along the path which could lead to more aggressive worker action including strikes . <p> Coasting , or quiet quitting , can be a reaction to stress and workplace burnout and this seems to be gaining traction as the backdrop for these worker movements . <p> A recently released survey by the Employers and Manufacturers Association ( EMA ) and insurer NIB shows why these ideas are catching on . <p> This survey of 1200 New Zealand workers found 85% of employees suffered tiredness , 63% felt anxious and 69% had difficulty concentrating . <p> One-in-four employees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those thinking about a career change , 78% said they were looking for flexible working , 74% for career development , 74% for regular performance feedback , and 69% for wellbeing initiatives . <p> EMA chief executive Brett O'Riley said the survey found the number one cause of workplace stress is understaffing , which often leads to poor work-life balance and places pressure on employees to work longer hours . <p> He said employees intending to change jobs in the next 12 months should sound a clear warning bell that businesses need to pay more attention to their employees ' wellbeing . <p> The workplace health and safety regulator , Worksafe , found in its New Zealand Psychosocial Survey that the speed and intensity of work , the need to conceal feelings from other people at work , and workload were the most common sources of psychosocial risk for workers . <p> It found demands at work are the most common psychosocial risk across the New Zealand workforce . <p> This report found people are recognising wellbeing as an important component of workplace experiences post-pandemic , and workers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their wellbeing . <p> A study of 31,000 people from 31 countries published by Microsoft in 2022 found 53% of those surveyed said they are more likely to prioritise their health and wellbeing over work than before the pandemic . <p> People report a greater need for prioritising health , wellbeing , and family over work compared to pre-pandemic times and they wish to better integrate those needs through how and where they work . <p> And in Microsoft 's Work Trend Index study , 47% of people said they are more likely to put family and personal life over work than they were before the pandemic . <p> It also found burnout has been on the rise during the pandemic , and workplace was the top stressor for American adults , costing the US economy an estimated $300 billion annually . <p> It is a rejection of hustle culture . A rejection of the idea that work should be the most important thing in our lives , a rejection of spending most of the days of our lives working as hard as we can . It is about embracing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realising work will go on , with or without you . <p> Here 's a tweet from a stressed worker . " Every job where I have n't quit has exploited me ...

" <p> Mark Bolino , director of management and international business at the University of Oklahoma , explained it like this . <p> " The pandemic has forced people to think about life , work and family differently . Much of the workforce has also reassessed how their careers fit into their lives . " <p> And if your career is n't fitting into your life as well as you think it should , quiet quitting starts to look appealing . <p> Of course , the Chinese workers who brought tang ping to the fore now have a new catchphrase I expect will be spun into an English interpretation soon enough . <p> Now , it is not about lying flat .

For reference I got burnt out up to march this year and have quiet quit up until the last month or so , it takes time to recover and pull yourself back together . Wellington is slowly draining as first home buyers leave for more affordable areas and can either work remotely for good coin and have a lower cost of living , large businesses having high staff turnover not only due to culture , but even those with good culture are losing staff to better money elsewhere , youth leaving for overseas where the money can be insane depending what area you are in ( reference , I have a friend offered ? 149k starting rate as a lawyer in London ) .

I get the feeling that those who " quiet quit " do n't just do so with their jobs , but also with their own life , they give up . I would hope that someone 's job , no matter how basic , is more than just work , that there is some pride in doing well , and recognition form the employer of a job well done . We spend too much time in our life at work , not enjoy it , do something you like , at least most of the time , then it wo n't feel like " work " , also you 'll be good at it and people will notice . Most importantly you 'll be happy . Do n't give up , do n't quit on yourself ! <p> I had a supposedly committed life partner a long time ago who " quiet quit " on me over several months ( did n't know what it was by that name then ) . She eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious &amp; wilful misconduct . <p> When dealing with businesses , mainly larger ones , and government authorities , I increasingly get the impression I am being somewhat " looked after " by a " quiet quitter " . Whether or not I have an understanding of their reasons , I will certainly not be tempted to do business on that basis . The more people that feel like that , the less those quiet quitter jobs will survive I am afraid . Opportunities for the more responsive businesses and work force . <p> Whether there is a link between quiet quitting and the dropping productivity - I can only speculate . But if there is a link , quiet quitting becomes a further factor in our inflation figures , which are hurting all of us . <p> When I first started working for my current employer , we were a US corporate that merged with another US Corp . Saw the head count reductions , people made redundant and asked to reapply for less jobs . Were sold to a private equity firm , split up and found our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of putting my hand up to assist the team when quiet , rather than doing the " bare minimum " as per the job description . When SHTF and the reductions happen , being expected to do the job of 2-3 people is better than sitting at home on the couch . <p> It 's not just employees that are " quiet quitting " . CEOs are masters of this . This is often how they got to where they are . Relying on employees working their guts out for a pittance while they took every advantage they could along their career path . <p> Some employees are just waking up to the fact that their employers " quiet quit " on them ages ago , right from the very beginning . <p> The arguments here are quite a good bellweather for where general economic sentiment is in the here and now , with a wide spectrum of views and opinions from a variety of backround . <p> If you 're in a retail or large-scale merch environment , it 's quite useful to get a handle on where things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or inflation figures to tell us what has already happened . That 's not useful information to me then . I keep this in mind when I 'm modelling things like cashflow . <p> In the First World , ' workers ' have been getting relatively - and really - poorer since the 1970 's . This was disguised with debt , bread and circuses . <p> Now , the cross-over point is well behind us ; it 's worth more to grow food and do your own maintenance at home , than to work for a pittance , borrow the difference and pay someone . As a couple , we live on one 4-day salary ; one is permanently at home building , planting , maintaining , producing . It 's simply worth more to us , that the second person earning a wage . <p> The " system " constantly try to pull you back into the termite super colony though . Increasing your fixed costs exponentially , while at the same time inflating away the value of any asset you might have and increasing rules that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ societal interaction . At no point can you say , " I 've got enough to kick back and relax " , unless you are 90+ of course . The system does n't like that . At 90 you 're being cleaned out of those now valueless savings acquired from all those years of working overtime for the company anyhow . <p> I guess it comes down to how you value your time and whether you can tolerate paid employment . If you can work for a day or two and can buy a year 's worth of potatoes with the proceeds its debatable how efficient it is to grow them yourself . <p> Good comment . Some companies are in a permanent state of " emergency measures " , not replacing staff , cutting R&amp;D , trying to make employees work harder and more efficiently , micro-managing , implementing new systems to track workers and eliminate individuality . Nirvana is just around the corner ... Now some workers are getting tired of it they accuse them of " quiet quitting " . <p> I have never understood why the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking marginal . <p> I did the absolute bare minimum with a large corporate for 18 months while I got my business running . Write good reports , corporate speak at meetings , do n't make suggestions above your station , keep your staff happy - pro tip - bbqs for Friday lunch every fortnight , , good bbq , no precooked snags or marinated steaks . Did n't retain vege staff for some reason . <p> Many people posting on line about quiet quitting seem to have done so in response to poor management . It 's not a problem in the company I work in . <p> There 's also an aspect of poor managerial organisation overloading people with admin as well as work , to the point they can get little done . This is demoralising and causing burnout . Interesting discussions going on in the area of deep work/slow productivity regarding this issue . <p> I did some analysis of why a company was experiencing a trend of increasing staff turnover , though it was n't yet over the industry average . I sat down with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thru the last 50 employees to leave . Two thirds of them had been openly critical of their manager(s) leading up to their resignation . So it comes down to the boss . <p> However I do n't think most people have any idea of how stressed and unhappy your average CEO of a large company is . In my experience over half would have sought help at some point . <p> My view of where we are headed is the bulk of the population pretty much disengaging ( even from family life ) and medicating themselves with games , drugs , porn , entertainment , sex bots etc , and the rest becoming super motivated robotic engineers or whatever . <p> Working out what makes me happy and being the best version of myself is how I see life . Understanding my own values and then engaging in activities ( including paid work ) that helps me enjoy those values makes me content . <p> If that is n't possible for me while I am employed then work is a means to an end and becomes paid incarceration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathise . Ultimately those that have a job they enjoy and find rewarding have either worked it out and made changes or are lucky . Either of those will work but only one person can make the change . <p> Yes it 's kind of pejorative . An employee could simply be protecting their sanity , preserving their work/life balance , sticking to the terms of the contract , avoiding being exploited or just working smarter . <p> A self policed process of doing exactly what you think is expected of you and not an ounce more is the same thing . If you are not doing what 's expected of you , eventually someone will be having a little chat with you . <p> Wow ! A lot of cynicism here , or perhaps it is me that is naive . Over my lifetime , I have certainly experienced good bosses , bad bosses , good colleagues , bad colleagues , but by &amp; large most of us started at the bottom , often doing menial stuff , but everyone generally expected to get experience , be promoted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seemed to work . <p> I have noticed among my offspring that expectations seem to be a bit unrealistic , start work , become an executive within months/buy a house much like your parents with all new whiteware etc/ holiday overseas , etc .. <p> I must admit we have been taken in by the socialist rhetoric to an unhealthy degree .. ie , do n't worry , your government will look after all the hard stuff . I do n't underrate the huge difficulties facing the younger folk , especially getting a roof over their heads . But I do believe the worst thing that happened with covid pandemic was a belief , heavily promoted by the media , that the challenges ahead were so daunting , that only the government could rescue you , and of course you have a human right to a warm dry home , food on the table , so do n't worry if getting all this is too hard , " we " will sort it for you . <p> No denying difficulties and some real pain , but believing that any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a scam which can only result in tears . <p> To be honest , this sounds more like a perspective steeped in generational preconceptions ( or talkback radio discussions ) than accurately in touch with what people are actually discussing or up to in younger generations in the workplace . I work with many from younger generations and read their perspectives more widely and there 's massive motivation and work ethic . Just not where conditions and leadership are rubbish . <p> My views are somewhat prehistoric , because most of my living has come from generating a volume of work , weight of produce , square meters , that sort of thing . Super binary stuff , you have either succeeded in generating X amount of product at Y price , or you have not . <p> Many jobs are not like this , so the parameters for achieving or not achieving become somewhat arbitrary . <p> It is just my anecdote , but people who can consistently turn out the requisite volume at a reasonable quality level are becoming rarer to come by . They also are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability , I have seen a lot of fairly unexceptional Forest Gump types end up doing pretty well in life despite themselves . <p> Hard pinning down one specific reason for this change , but there are many . <p> I spent my working life in chemical manufacturing companies ( 4 including 2 multinationals ) , from the factory floor to the boardroom . Everyone knew every day whether we were doing a good job or not . With allowances &amp; penal rates ( multishift operations ) the factory workers base pay was above the NZ median income , then there was additional overtime for coverage training SL AL etc . <p> Staff attitudes of entitlement have increased alot . A good recession and widespread unemployment such as the free money crash that is just starting now will help heal the rot . Creative destruction is nature 's way . <p> Considering that many workplaces outright refused WFH and other arrangements until Covid happened , I 'd say businesses are finally reaping the rewards of decades of inflexibility and expecting to eat into more and more of an employee 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around commuting , while not coming to the party in terms of better wages that match living costs or fringe benefits to help offset it . <p> It 's not leaving the house at 530am to be able to leave early enough to only spend an hour in the evening commute on the way home . It 's basically three hours a day back that you do n't get paid for . It was something that many companies swore could n't be done and would n't work until they literally did not have a choice . <p> And guess what , it turns out it was possible the whole time . Throw in rising fuel costs , increasing congestion and other things like sports pick-ups and drop-offs and suddenly you 're talking tens of thousands of dollars a year of unpaid time related to work that you suddenly have back . <p> Exactly , a boom and bust is as natural as the four seasons . We need a good downturn to clean out the mal investment . The heart of this problem is central banks and the monetary system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much debt caused the problem , how will more debt make it better ? It 's time for monetary reform . <p> Businesses would do the same to you in a heartbeat pay you the minimum that they can to retain you . If they replace you with someone cheaper overseas they would . Its just people waking to companies not being loyal to them so why should they be loyal to the company . <p> Yup , and if wages for a decent week 's work had kept pace with actual living costs incurred by employees , we would n't have a housing affordability issue . <p> Throw in the general unwinding of redundancy , family medical insurance , company cars and other such perks over the last few decades and I 'd be surprised if the actual lot of most professionals has improved , if at all , until the advent of WFH post-Covid . <p> When they really started pumping global free trade , even as a youngster I wondered how they could maintain lifestyles in the West while introducing a few hundred percent more workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does that . It makes everything seem hopeless . You can never afford to buy a house , you are just on a treadmill . <p> How did it come to this ? <p> Maybe it is just the cyclical nature of life . A country goes through a period of growth , then a period of decline and then , eventually , a period of growth again . <p> All the way through the long years of decline our dear tyrant leaders desperately search for the magic elixir that will re-ignite growth . Yet , each magic elixir turns out to be a scam , easily sold to our gullible and desperate leaders . Thus , all their plans turn to dust and only serve to cause yet more grief , by turning a difficult period into a catastophe by lengthening and deepening the decline . 
@@93337237 <p> But first , the latest dairy auction has delivered higher prices . Overall they were up +4.9% in USD terms , and with our currency weakening , the rise in NZD was a stellar +10.2% . These rises were led by WMP which delivered a bit of a surprise . WMP was up +5.1% from the last auction . But in between there was a GDT Pulse event for WMP a week ago and that did not signal such a big rise today . Today 's WMP result is +5.7% higher than the GDP Pulse event . Buyers are realising that future supply is going to be lower than they were planning so demand is returning to shore up that supply shortfall . <p> This the US , they have returned from their long Labor Day weekend to face sharply rising yields as bond losses pile up . The USD is surging too especially against commodity currencies which are in full retreat . <p> However , the US service sector is firing on all cylinders ( if that is a valid phrase these days as the car industry turns electric ? ) . The ISM services PMI expanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was led by activity and new orders . Labour markets remained tight , they said . <p> The ISM services PMI is the widely-watched services survey in the US , but it is n't the only one . The internationally benchmarked Markit one told a quite different story . Usually these surveys see quite similar conditions , but not this month . The Markit services PMI is in contraction and reporting its sharpest fall since May 2020 with new orders retreating . One of them is wrong , its just not clear which one at this time . <p> Separately the US logistics LMI reports a fifth month of easing in August , the lowest expansion since May 2020 . Mostly it is falling demand . Although the index shows the overall logistics industry continues to expand , the rate of growth is now well below the all-time high/tightness in March . Warehousing Capacity is down again , transportation prices fell for a second month while transportation capacity continued to increase and inventory levels grew . This logistics LMI suggests the Markit PMI might be closer to the mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the bond market is back to pricing in another full +75 bps rate hike at the next US Fed review on Thursday , September 22 ( NZT ) . Bond prices are taking a hammering . <p> In China , economic news has gone very quiet . It is neither fashionable not wise to report news that their economy is struggling , especially ahead of the upcoming Party Congress . But it is clear that house prices in their resale markets are falling across a broad range of cities now . And the Chengdu lockdown is shaping up to be a make-or-break situation for their zero-Covid policies . <p> In Japan , their currency is weakening fast . The Bank of Japan is holding on to its aggressive easing program to finally get inflation rising , and it might succeed . But the cost is a sharply falling yen as those easing policies are now in sharp contrast to the rest of the word . The very much wider yield gap between US Treasuries and Japanese government bonds has encouraged investors to dump the yen for the dollar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extensive support programs for energy supply and household budgets as the winter season looms , one where there will be no Russian energy to cover the cold snap . The size of these programs in total could be epic , and the EU is stepping up itself with overarching support . <p> In Australia late yesterday , their central bank raised its cash rate target by +50 bps to 2.35% . This was as expected . They said they are n't seeing any reason to expect CPI inflation lower than 7 ? % in 2022 , so the pressure remains to get it back to 3% and within their policy range . In turn that means more outsized hikes can be expected , although they are clearly trying to avoid tipping them into a consumer-led spending recession . <p> The UST 10yr yield starts today at 3.33% and up +13 bps after Wall Street 's long weekend .

But the tech-heavy indexes are down more . Overnight , European markets were generally positive , most up +0.2% except Frankfurt which was up +0.9% . Yesterday Tokyo ended flat , Hong Kong dipped -0.1% . But Shanghai rose a strong +1.4% .

The main advantage is no adjustment in gap and the biggest these days no adjustment in timing . <p> it was a lot easier to keep cars running back then than it is now .

Lot of fun doing that . <p> I 've had a few issues with modern computer controlled cars and when they start playing up you have to take them to a mechanic with the right diagnostic equipment to test the systems . Those systems used to be brand specific but I expect them to be more universal today . It is more expensive to replace the bits too today . <p> " In the past , you got a manual with your car advising you how to change oil , adjust points , etc . Nowdays there 's just a sticker telling you not to drink the battery acid " <p> It 's a bob each way , if you 're not inclined towards doing anything mechanical at all , newer cars are now less work . But from a serviceability perspective , they 're way more complex and beyond what most people could do in their own rapidly vanishing personal garage . <p> No , currently a Ranger from new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the computer problems . <p> Granted the computer systems are more reliable today , and i have had no issue other than a ruptured sense line ( cheap to fix ) . But talking to mechanic mates when the computer systems start playing up they can be difficult and expensive to repair . The older cars need more frequent tuning , but were easier and cheaper to keep running . <p> Im with you , I have built numerous engines in my lifetime , mostly twin carburetted , I did cheat and install points replacement modules in some , which were very reliable . Recently I put an injected coil on plug engine into a car , along with a modern 6 speed slushbox , the learning curve on wiring and ecu and transmission tuning has been torturous . For the record it does run . <p> I 'm no fuddy duddy but agree . I had an otherwise perfectly operating Toyota sports car which had some capacitors in the ECU delaminate at 165,000k causing sputtering and misfiring. $1100 ( in 2006 ) to rebuild the computer and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ICE cars these days are excellent , but beyond the ability of the average home mechanic to repair . <p> A useful tip if your modern car is doing strange things . Disconnect the negative battery lead and leave it off for 20 minutes minimum . Reconnect and wait 20 seconds at each step of restarting engine . i.e. 20 secs from battery connect to accessory position . Then a further 20 secs before full ignition mode and a further 20 secs before attempting to start . It corrects many ecu faults . <p> I moved to getting a cheap generic Bluetooth OBDII reader from E-Bay a few years ago and some software for the laptop . The fault codes the ECU can put out is very useful these days . Reliability is highly brand dependent , my Toyota was beyond believable with the ECU still going after 30 years . <p> While I tend to agree , I 've got a Peugeot 307 with a failed ECU . Looks like it might go to the scrap heap despite only 160km on the clock as I ca n't find a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere in the world . A new one is more than the cost of the car . I 'll go back to Toyota , although I think even they peaked in reliability in the 90 's . Too much complexity now . <p> Only way I 'd ever go back to European is with an EV . And even then , it would have to be mostly outsourced to the other bits of the world who know better . The E208 , 2008 and other Stellantis EVs we can buy here atm are all running a NIDEC unit , so functionally a Japanese motor , inverter and charger . <p> My circles used to joke that you could put twenty economists in a room , close the door and ask them to come up with a ham sandwich .

Maybe that is all that matters . <p> Just because you have an IQ of 130 or better does n't mean you do n't have your blind spots . There are one or two contributors to these pages who seem to believe that because they ( claim ) to have a high IQ then they must be right in all things . Even self proclaimed ' thinkers ' fall into these traps . I sometimes wonder if they are so smart why do they contribute to the comment streams rather than write the articles ?

Those ' smart ' and ' thinkers ' must be here just to educate us dummies ? <p> If you attempt to hold energy prices below the market clearing rate ( i.e a binding energy price freeze ) not only do you push the quantity of energy demanded up but you ensure there 's a shortage . Either that or you force govt owned entities ( not 100% on the exact structure of Scotland 's energy markets ) to sell energy at a negative economic profit . <p> Enabling energy prices to reflect supply and demand in this case would push energy prices higher , ensuring people pay closer to the true price of their consumption ... I am puzzled why you would have an issue with this ... <p> ... or is it perhaps just that the opportunity to take a dig at economics was too good to resist ? : D <p> Yeah , but of course if government intervention in the market , and poor provision of infrastructure ( a key government responsibility ) is causing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remove the current sources of inefficiency , rather than add another source of inefficiency , that deals with some of the current symptoms . <p> Consider it like putting a poisoned band-aid on a wound .

Better to fix it properly once , then poorly once and properly twice* <p> Yes , I definitely accept the infrastructure provision argument . I have a great visualization of this for my students - two graphs side-by-side : one being population growth , the other being infrastructure build/provision . It stunningly highlights our infrastructure investment deficit . <p> We let too many people in via immigration over the last 20 or so years . <p> Thing is - they 're here now and you ca n't build Rome in a day . And taking resource and energy scarcity into account , it 's questionable whether we 'll ever catch up . Hence , we 're in a pickle - our options are : re-purpose ; re-build new or abandon . Re-build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skill scarcity as well - the majority of recent migrants never had the skills to build the infrastructure required to accommodate themselves . <p> So immigration has aggravated the very infrastructure crisis it was promised to solve in the first place . <p> What scares me is that there is still no policy in place to solve this issue . If low-wage employers once again end up dominating the visa application numbers , this critical skill gap will only widen further . <p> Much if not all that ' skill scarcity ' will be driven by successive Government 's adherence to the ' free market ' economic model and overall neglect of infrastructure . Any engineer worth their salt will have gone elsewhere to get the pay and the opportunities to use their skills . <p> I also made a comment above re Scotlands current move today to public &amp; private rent control which you may have missed - not that I agree with your perspective but to reassure you that you 're not alone in your thinking : ) . <p> We 've had this topic &amp; discussion a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neoliberal mindset " , NZs most socialist PM in recent history Rob Muldoon attempted the last rent freeze ( along with prices &amp; wages etc ) in a King Canute like attempt to hold back the inflationary waters of 40 years ago . It did n't work then &amp; it wo n't work now . Those who do n't learn the lessons of history are doomed to repeat it . <p> I think Piggy would roll over in his grave if he knew you thought he was a socialist ! That 's funny ! <p> But rent controls in isolation will never work . That is why they have failed in all instances internationally . Check it out . Rent controls have always been put in place on their own to cover social housing . That is the equivalent of saying there can just be one rule to govern our roads . It may be speed , condition of the vehicle , which side you drive on or what ever but there can only be ONE rule . It can not and wo n't work . Rent control is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and regulation governing social housing , but no government has the understanding or the political will to enact them . <p> After a mixed picture from the manufacturing side of the US economy ( ISM stable , PMI weak ) , US services surveys were expected to both show more weakness in August . <p> S&amp;P Global 's US Services PMI did indeed fall and disappoint , printing 43.7 vs 44.1 expected ( and below its flash print ) and well below its 47.1 print for July - that is thelowest since May 2020 . <p> Of course , in keeping with the utter insanity of the ' baffle em with bullshit ' data we are seeing , US ISM Services unexpectedly rose in August - extending July 's unexpected rise - at 56.9 ( above 55.4 expected ) and its highest since April . <p> Take your pick - either US Services are contracting at the fastest pace with the lockdowns or are expanding at their fastest pace in 5 months ... and the picture was the same mixed view in Manufacturing ... <p> The reason the public service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pool ) is because governments want them to " do " more . Vote for a government that does less and you 'll see numbers drop off . <p> It was my contention at the start of Covid , and I 've said so on these pages many times , that one very good reason that lockdowns wo n't work is that people make mistakes . <p> If you really want to know about misinformation then try Chris Martensen . Articles from Peak Prosperity used to frequent these pages , not so much anymore as it turns out Chris is a pathologist and quite well qualified to understand public health . He has always questioned the main stream narrative , but his questioning not so welcome anymore as it goes against too much bias . Look up one of his latest videos " When Push Comes to Nudge " .

Palindromes ? <p> Yes , driven by an appreciating USD and a rampaging tightening Fed . Countries will defend their currency and a global currency war is underway .

@@93337238 <p> Economists at the country 's largest bank are predicting that inflation will be back to the targeted 2% level by mid-2024 , but they see " a long and difficult battle " for the Reserve Bank ( RBNZ ) against domestic inflation pressures . <p> In an NZ Insight publication ANZ economist Finn Robinson and chief economist Sharon Zollner say " surging wage growth " and ongoing local cost pressures will see NZ-generated inflation " hold up around current highs " till early next year before gradually easing . This publication is the second part of a detailed crunch of the inflation picture by the ANZ economists , with the first published earlier in the week . <p> The RBNZ has been aggressively hiking interest rates since October last year to counter inflation that has been running very hot , reaching 7.3% by the June quarter of this year .

Even in our central forecast , inflation would have been above the 2% midpoint of the RBNZ 's target band for three years . We see risks around the outlook for both domestic ( non-tradable ) and global ( tradable ) components of inflation . " <p> The economists say the key is to distinguish between the short and medium term . <p> " In the very near term , we fully expect inflation to ease , and quickly , particularly thanks to factors like rapidly falling oil prices . But over the medium-term , we see significant risks that inflation will remain too high for too long , which would necessitate further OCR hikes in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> They say that " front and centre " on the domestic inflation front is the possibility that rapidly accelerating labour costs ( absent a commensurate increase in productivity ) could see domestic inflation pressures come in stronger and more persistent than forecast . <p> " We currently anticipate that annual growth in private sector productivity-adjusted labour costs will peak at 4.4% in the first quarter of 2023 ( versus 3.4% in Q2 2022 ) . But wage pressures have surprised recently with their strength . Domestic labour demand remains insatiable , and with the Australian labour market likely to add further heat over the next year , upside surprises feel likelier than downside ones . " <p> This highlights , the economists say , the " double-edged sword " that is sharply rising wages . <p> " It sounds like great news for households , and it 's no doubt a relief for workers , particularly those on lower incomes , who have been watching inflation eat away at their real purchasing power . But for the RBNZ , strong wage growth means that household demand is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have delivered -- ie that more OCR action could be required to slow spending sufficiently to bring inflation down . " <p> Robinson and Zollner say that as surging inflation gets factored into wage and price-setting behaviour , it raises the risk that a 4% OCR is no longer as much of a brake on the economy as previously thought . <p> " In other words , high inflation expectations and wage growth mean the neutral OCR could currently be creeping higher ( the neutral OCR is the level of the OCR that is neither contractionary nor expansionary for the economy ) . In coalface terms , people 's idea of what a ' reasonable ' mortgage rate is might be gradually lifting again , just as it gradually fell as inflation and nominal interest rates trended lower over years and decades . <p> " The RBNZ 's latest estimate of the neutral OCR is 2% , but they have already said that they are revisiting their models , and some members of the Monetary Policy Committee have given a range of 2-3% as their sense for where neutral is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes in the neutral OCR go 1:1 into the required OCR . If the neutral OCR is 3% rather than 2% , then an OCR closer to 5% rather than 4%would be needed to deliver the monetary tightening required to bring inflation back to 2% within an acceptable timeframe , all else equal . Sounds high , but so is inflation . And it 's still well-below the 8.25% OCR peak seen before the GFC ( although the housing market was still in full bubble mode at that point , whereas currently house prices are falling ) . " <p> On a global perspective , the economists believe that " one-off spikes " in inflation look likely to become more common . <p> " While Covid appears to be in retreat as a global disruptor ( touch wood ) , geopolitical tensions continue to raise the risk of ongoing commodity price surges , or a retrenchment of global trade . And the ongoing costs of adverse weather conditions continue to mount as climate change rolls inexorably forward . All of these factors mean the era of New Zealand importing global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " All in all , it 's an inflation soup out there , both domestically and internationally . We 've seen a perfect storm of supply-side impacts through COVID-19 and the supply chain chaos it has unleashed , combined with what turned out to be overly powerful fiscal and monetary stimulus ( given how unexpectedly resilient economies turned out to be over the past few years ) . While we are forecasting that a 4% OCR will be enough to achieve a return to 2% inflation over the next two years , there are clearly significant risks that interest rates will need to go higher to engineer a timely return to target . " <p> In summing up the situation , Robinson and Zollner say it 's not all one-way traffic for interest rates , but the balance of risks remains firmly tilted towards more hikes being needed than less . <p> " While headline inflation numbers look like they may have peaked in several countries , including New Zealand , that 's not sufficient .

The good news is that incomes are rising , albeit slowly . <p> If you have a particular distirct you want me to apply the formula to in order to calculate ' x ' - I 'd be happy to do so ! <p> I was recently looking at suburbs around Wellington - house values compared to median incomes . A couple stood out , in particular Island Bay where median household incomes were at or below national median based on the 2018 census however house prices generally 1.5 - 2x the national median . There are some very tired , run down 2 - 3br houses renting for $1200+ pw in Island Bay . Cases likely this are what make me think we still have a lot of downward pressure in the market . Entirely unsustainable without major wage inflation , and given the economy is being squeezed this money is disappearing fast . <p> I believe the real issue is that in Wellington at least , there are supposedly 80k homes . 40k of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expanding the city and renters are simply being squeezed out . Quite literally , they 're leaving . <p> Great article here - in summary , against today 's market prices for properties , no one will make a decent yield . But , many investors ( far more than not ) bought when house prices were affordable - and they are doing just fine based on profitability , but not yield ; <p> Brightline has made IRD 's life a whole lot simpler no need to take that fight now . Next change will be to extend the brightline to infinity and then it can be called what it really is , a capital gains tax . <p> Looking at the graph , this does feel like best case scenario . At any rate it 's difficult to see what may happen over the next year or two , especially with all that may happen offshore . <p> Basically , there 's no need to bet on it right now and I certainly would n't be putting my money in the ring . I guess in a way that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to it as tight as possible . <p> Why is it that workers and households are always the ones that are deemed to bear the costs of inflation ? We have economists saying that unemployment must rise to tame inflation and workers must reduce wage increases to below inflation and yet there are never the same calls to stop businesses from passing on costs or to reduce their profit margins . <p> Much of our economy suffers from a lack of true competition and where companies are free to charge us as much as they think that they can get away with . The power companies and supermarkets as an example . <p> While Covid appears to be in retreat as a global disruptor ( touch wood ) , geopolitical tensions continue to raise the risk of ongoing commodity price surges , or a retrenchment of global trade . And the ongoing costs of adverse weather conditions continue to mount as climate change rolls inexorably forward . All of these factors mean the era of New Zealand importing global deflation through our import prices is probably behind us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflation and low neutral OCR rate era had been passed . Globalisation is in retreat which brings higher demand and lower supply . There will be less money flow to assets and more money flow to goods and products which will give a decent boost to productive industries . The cost to service debt will be high also .

Using other more expensive measures to achieve emissions goals exacerbates the current cost of living crisis . <p> " A reliable domestic supply of natural gas is going to be a vital transition fuel to and beyond our journey to a net zero emissions economy . <p> " Unlike many European countries that are now facing soaring energy bills , New Zealand is blessed with good sources of domestic energy resources such as natural gas .

And if parents started driving down side streets to get to the school , councils could extend the ban to those side streets as well . And that 's just one example of how this policy would work . <p> But , unlike the housing intensification business , it 's quite likely that our local councils will love this one because councils - rightly or wrongly - are perceived as being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build cycleways and they love to tell us that we should be taking the bus and riding a bike . <p> The name of this government policy - Reshaping Streets - says it all , does n't it ? And councils love re-shaping streets . So maybe they wo n't be so quick to push back on it . <p> Another thing this proposed policy would do is it would let councils remove car parks for two years - again with just two weeks ' notice - and it 'd be two years before they had to ask us what we thought of it . <p> Just yesterday afternoon I went into town to do something but I just about gave up when it became so difficult finding somewhere to park - all because the council thinks we should n't be driving into town , and we should be riding our bikes or taking the bus . So there are nowhere near as many parking spaces in town as there used to be . <p> And that 's why I think councils everywhere are going to love this " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because if it goes through , they 'll be able to take away even more car parks ( with just two weeks ' notice ) and make us wait two years before we get to have a say on it . <p> They 'll be able to close the roads around schools during drop-off and pick-up time , with just two weeks ' notice , and make us wait two years before asking what we think of it . <p> In my view , calling these things " pilots " is nothing short of shifty .

However , it shows a condition of co-presence already observed in horses with bovine papillomavirus type-1 and 2 , and clinically evident in human papillomavirus-related disease . <p> " Our findings further prove the broad diversity of papillomavirus types in horses and highlight the need for further investigation of the clinical significance of this newly described virus .

Photo : Supplied / Chris Ford <p> To illustrate this point , I read some mortality data recently from the United States which extrapolated how - for example , for disabled people living with impairments including cerebral palsy ( which I live with ) , multiple sclerosis and learning disabilities - Covid-19 was the primary cause of death in 2019-2020 , whereas it was only the third highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have been available before last week , when our government took the decision to scrap all but what it deemed as the most necessary requirements to retain . <p> Regretfully , the Labour government , facing many pressing political pressures due to the cost-of-living crisis that have been impacting on its popularity , chose to repeal the last remaining restrictions around mandatory mask use in public places including shops and public transport , as well as all remaining vaccination mandates . <p> I fear that all this has been done to simply keep Labour 's support up amongst non-disabled voters without considering any of the implications for disabled people whose voice is often politically marginalised , even at the best of times . <p> Moreover , given the lower socioeconomic status of much of the disability community , it would be fair to say that many disabled people and people with health conditions traditionally vote Labour at general elections . <p> I wonder how many disabled people would be feeling so inclined to vote for them at the moment ? Time will tell . <p> Furthermore , I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind for the struggling government in its decision , especially given that the official email from Whaikaha the Ministry of Disabled People requesting feedback from disability community organisations gave only 24 hours for this to occur . <p> Critically , the new ministry - that is supposed to act as the voice of disabled people - also failed to send it to all Disabled Persons Organisations ( DPOs ) - organisations run by and for disabled people . <p> I know this because I work for a DPO , the Disabled Persons Assembly ( DPA ) New Zealand , whose chief executive ( my boss ) Prudence Walker told the Otago Daily Times earlier this month that this omission " ... was a critical oversight " . <p> And a ' critical oversight ' it has really turned out to be , with masking up only now required in health care settings including hospitals , doctor 's surgeries and pharmacies as well as rest homes . <p> While access to essential Covid-19 antivirals for people who fall ill with the virus has been expanded , these requirements still do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In fact , I checked with my GP about this at my last medical check-up in mid-August , and as we went through the criteria list together , it was found that I would not immediately qualify for any antivirals if I fell ill with Covid-19 , even though I 'm over 50 and meet most of the other requirements . <p> All of these actions have caused simmering concern within the disability community , and even outright anger from some within it , including from my good friend and prominent fellow advocate Dr Huhana Hickey . <p> Other prominent medical and scientific professionals who have been really great allies of disabled and marginalised people during the pandemic , including one of my great Kiwi heroes Dr Siouxsie Wiles , spoke out in saying that it was too early to do away with masking up , as Covid-19 could still throw up some nasty new variants , especially as the Northern Hemisphere goes into what will be a very difficult winter , meaning that any new , potentially nastier variants might make their way southwards , even while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone to keep wearing masks . A new study shows super spreader events likely help new variants take hold rather than fizzle out . https : //t.co/YudZaYPxzy <p> While I acknowledge the government has given itself some wriggle room to dial up masking and other requirements should the need arise , it still is not enough . <p> Doing away with the traffic light settings altogether means some new and otherwise untested system will have to come from the Ministry of Health if new variants eventuate . <p> Therefore , how much non-disabled people would be prepared to tolerate ( and comply with ) a new round of masking up would be interesting , to say the least , particularly if it comes after a prolonged period of not having to do so . <p> Personally , I would have preferred the mandates to stay for places including supermarkets , airports , public transport and all public buildings , and for people visiting supported residential and other services for disabled people , and with a review to be completed in December in close partnership with disabled people and their organisations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grey Power ) . <p> Any mandates should only have been altered or removed with the full involvement and agreement of representatives from the most impacted communities . <p> Regretfully , though , I recognise that the Covid-19 rule relaxation ship has now sailed . Whether I like it or not , that ship will have to sail with disabled people like me within it . <p> At a personal level , I will still wear a mask if I am in places where I deem myself to be at risk , and this will include , for example , at large-scale indoor events . <p> Otherwise , political considerations and the supposed lessening of infections should not be the only considerations which inform all future decision-making around Covid-19 . <p> I believe that we should be wary , for at least the next six months , as I believe it will take that length of time to determine whether Covid-19 will remain in abeyance or flare up again . <p> That 's why I believe that all remaining Covid-19 restrictions should only have been removed beginning next year and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an overnight one . <p> By this time next year , I believe that we might be over the worst ( fingers crossed ) . <p> But , in the meantime , if Covid-19 turns unexpectedly bad again ( and it could do that very quickly ) then the government , opposition parties and various business groups that originally called for the immediate removal of restrictions should be held responsible - if politics triumphs over science , reason and the human rights of our most at-risk communities . <p> * Chris Ford is a Dunedin-based freelance writer and disability advocate .

As economist and political commentator Eric Crampton wrote yesterday , if the allegations -- especially those documented by Herald journalist Kate McNamara -- bear up , then " New Zealand is a fundamentally corrupt country . If it does n't , the air needs clearing " . <p> Latest revelations about the Mahuta family contracts <p> Three government agencies have been undertaking reviews this year into how they came to give contracts to Mahuta 's husband , Gannin Ormsby , and other close family members . Ormsby owns a consultancy , Ka Awatea Services , which has been contracted to supply services in the last couple of years to Kainga Ora , the Ministry for the Environment , and the Department of Conservation . Another consultancy , Kawai Catalyst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tomoko and Waimirirangi Ormsby , and has also gained government contracts . <p> The latest revelation , which MacNamara reported on yesterday , is that Kainga Ora has admitted it did not follow correct procedures in awarding a contract to Ormsby , and is now undertaking a review of how this occurred . MacNamara reports : " Housing Minister Megan Woods has confirmed that Crown housing agency Kainga Ora was deficient in its conflict of interest processes in awarding Ka Awatea Services a $66,846 ( excluding GST ) contract . " <p> According to Kainga Ora , Ormsby 's firm was hired to " engage Maori and to understand Maori perspectives on Kainga Ora urban development work " . The firm then used another relative , Rama Ormsby , to do the work . <p> It seems no conflict of interest declarations were sought or received from any of the participants , despite Mahuta then being the Associate Minister for Housing with specific responsibility for Maori housing . <p> MacNamara reports : " Woods previously said that ' a verbal conflict of interest was declared ' when the contract was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the clarification that no " formal " conflicts , written or verbal , were declared . " <p> The " Extraordinary pattern " of government contracts <p> TDB Recommends NewzEngine.com <p> All three contracts that Ka Awatea Services has won with the government agencies were awarded while Ormsby 's wife , Nanaia Mahuta , had ministerial responsibilities for those agencies . Furthermore , as MacNamara reports , " All of the contracts were awarded on a sole source basis , without competitive bids . " <p> In terms of the contracts provided by the Ministry for the Environment to the family firms Ka Awatea Services and Kawai Catalyst , a review has just been released that shows " a litany of deficiencies in the process of awarding the contracts " . For example , due to the family connections the contracts should have been signed off by the Ministry 's chief executive . Further conflicts of interest were not sufficiently discussed or managed . <p> The Department of Conservation is also reviewing the process that led to Ka Awatea Services being awarded a $52,000 contract , which has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report , MacNamara also reveals that the Government 's Criminal Cases Review Commission has employed Ormsby as a " connector " since January 2021 . She reports : " It has been asked whether Ormsby 's criminal record was considered relevant in his hiring but has not yet responded . In 2003 , Ormsby pleaded guilty and was convicted on one charge of assaulting a woman . " <p> In addition , the Waikato Regional Council has recently employed Ormsby for $33,000 to provide consulting services to identify issues Maori were facing in the area , and last year the Ministry of Maori Development gave his firm a $28,000 grant to assist on suicide prevention . <p> Has Nanaia Mahuta dealt with the conflicts of interest appropriately ? <p> Both the Prime Minister and Nanaia Mahuta have suggested that there is nothing to see here , saying the Minister has followed the correct procedures in dealing with the conflicts of interest arising from these family contracts . <p> The first device for dealing with a conflict of interest has been for the Minister to essentially recluse herself from the situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For example , when her sister Tipa Mahuta was appointed chair of the new Three Waters regulatory advisory group , the Minister passed her Local Government responsibilities to Kelvin Davis while the decision was made . <p> But this has n't always occurred . Kate McNamara points out , for example , when she " appointed Waimirirangi Ormsby to the group that produced the He Puapua report " , this was deemed unnecessary because Ormsby was not a " close relative " . <p> Mahuta also says that she has covered herself by declaring " conflicts of interest " to the Cabinet Office and colleagues whenever they have arisen . However , just because such a conflict is declared does n't mean that it is no longer a problem . <p> Commenting on this recently to the Herald , Prof Karin Lasthuizen , the Chair in Ethical Leadership at Victoria University of Wellington , has argued that this can be like a passenger declaring the possession of forbidden goods on arrival into the country but not then doing anything about it : " Saying you can manage this conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a big hornets ' nest to declare ' , and then Customs says , ' Okay , here 's a form for you to fill out and you will be fine ' . Of course it does n't work that way for a reason , and that 's the problem itself and the consequences it might have . You ca n't actually bring in a hornets ' nest into the country even if you declare it . " <p> Is an independent investigation required ? <p> So far , no other journalist or media outlet seem to be covering the ongoing questionable contracts apart from the Herald 's Kate MacNamara . She has written six reports on the topic so far this year . TVNZ 's Q+A programme did raise some of the allegations with Mahuta in an interview by Jack Tame recently , but she was able to easily swot away the questions , painting a picture of herself as a victim of malicious and anonymous online smears and was n't challenged on this . <p> To be fair , there might well be ulterior motives in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarters .

But that 's their legitimate role , and many of the facts about the Mahuta contracts have only come to light through questions being asked in Parliament . <p> Some have even attempted to paint questions being asked about potential corruption or nepotism as being racist . For example , on Newshub , Labour-aligned commentator Shane Te Pou denounced criticism of Mahuta as " racism and double standards " . <p> The Herald 's Audrey Young says it 's time to clear the issue up once and for all , saying Mahuta should just front foot the issue because questions are mounting , and they are distracting the Minister from important work : " They have reached such a pitch that she herself should refer the matter to the Public Service Commission or Auditor-General to get an independent opinion and draw a line under it .

@@93696235 <h> Better tedders , smarter balers <p> Kverneland has introduced a new 15.6m tedder aimed at high outputs , accuracy and operator comfort , incorporating a new ground-following system , with easy and simple operations . <p> The new Kverneland 85156 C offers a 15.6m working width , achieved using 14 rotors , with a general construction featuring oversized elements to help increase production and reduce downtime . <p> The small diameter rotor design provides a generous overlap between each rotor , resulting in efficient pick-up and inversion of the crop , as well as a regular distribution over the complete working width . Superior ground adaption over the full working width is achieved by the new TerraFlow solution , that features a highly flexible frame , allowing each of the 14 rotors to accurately follow ground contours . <p> A unique connection between the tedder unit and carrier frame means the rotors can flex and adapt to ground contour independent of the carrier frame . This ensures the tine- to-ground distance remains constant , providing clean work and a uniform crop flow . <p> Standard 380/55-17 tyres are said to give increased stability of the tedder and ensure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available as an option . Fitment to the tractor requires one single hydraulic for raising and lowering the tedder , alongside a double acting for machine folding/unfolding , with a transport width of less than 3 metres . <p> Crossing crop already spread is achieved using the single acting ram , which gives the machine adequate clearance and manoeuvrability . A new border spreading device helps keep the crop towards the body of the paddock when tedding along borderlines and headlands , with the hydraulically activated swath board keeping the crop within the working width of the tedder . <p> To reduce operational downtime , a clever design allows the Kverneland 85156 C to enjoy easy maintenance with long service intervals . Greasing points are kept to a minimum , while driveline ( except for the PTO ) , rotors and most of the joints are maintenance-free . <p> Meanwhile , the 6500F , a new generation of heavy-duty fixed chamber round baler introduced in 2020 , was joined by the variable chamber Plus Series in 2021 , aimed at users focused on predominately baling silage . Both are designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs . <p> The next logical step in was to incorporate a higher level of automation in both series . <p> Both models have been enhanced by the addition of TIM ( Tractor Implement Management ) capability , targeting professional farmers and contractors looking for improved efficiency and more operating comfort . <p> TIM enables two-way communication between tractor and implement , allowing both machines to work in unison , increasing efficiency and reducing the possibility of human error due to fatigue . <p> When working with TIM activated , the operator can concentrate on feeding the crop into the baler pick-up , with the remainder of the cycle being automated . <p> The Swedish manufacturer Quicke says its new range of Silocut shear grabs deliver a cleanly cut clamp face to reduce secondary fermentation , using less power , but can also split and cut wrapped silage bales , while retaining the film and net . 
@@93696236 <h> Cut , bale , wrap in one pass <p> A eureka moment in a pub led a Midlands , UK contractor to capitalise on his council mowing contract by devising a novel way of turning the clippings into saleable livestock feed . <p> Mitch Platt 's plan involved a second hand McHale Fusion baler wrapper with the standard pick-up assembly removed and replaced with a flail mower , allowing him to cut , bale and wrap round bales in one pass . <p> Prior to the brainwave , Mitch 's work involved maintaining wildflower meadows or sites of scientific interest , with any clippings needing to be removed to prevent fertility build . This entailed cutting with flail mowers with collectors , transferring the debris to trailers with a grab loader then dumping on a muck heap . Although the system worked , it was labour intensive and decent grass was being dumped and left to rot . <p> As well as creating silage that could be sold or given to his own livestock , his idea offered a considerable time and labour saving over his original system . <p> The conversion was started in 2018 , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roy , who was a skilled engineer . Roy 's experience was put to the test when it came to manufacturing pulleys for the driveline on a lathe and calculating rotational speeds . <p> He sourced a second hand , high bale count McHale Fusion 3 baler/wrapper from a dealer in Wales , its heavily worn pick up making it ideal for the project . The mowing element came by way of a 2.7m flail unit already on the farm , allowing a sub-3m transport width and the ability to deal with hidden , foreign objects . <p> Much of the development centred on getting the mower positioned to throw grass into the baler rotor , and on a drawbar design that offered a way of adjusting cutting height . Other tweaks included widening the baler intake and extending the side feed augers to match the width of the mower . <p> The Y-shaped flails on the mower cut the grass into 5cm lengths . <p> The driveline was sorted by Mitch 's father who cleverly designed a belt-driven system to accommodate the mismatch of the baler running at 540rpm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a right-angled gearbox . <p> The final part of the system was to add a molasses tank , to make poorer grass more palatable , using air from the tractor to send a fine mist of molasses into the rotor via four jets . <p> Up and running for the 2018 season , bar a few minor teething problems , it worked well , although lack of visibility of the cut grass entering the baler means the driver needs to stay alert . <p> Working speeds range from 5km/h to 16km/h and cutting height is adjusted according to the conditions . The Y-shaped flails on the mower cut the grass into 5cm lengths , delivery bales that typically weigh around one tonne . Due to travel distances , a JCB Fastrac 4220 is the preferred power unit . <p> The Swedish manufacturer Quicke says its new range of Silocut shear grabs deliver a cleanly cut clamp face to reduce secondary fermentation , using less power , but can also split and cut wrapped silage bales , while retaining the film and net .

If we travel in both directions , the rake can grab two swaths from the mower and move 18m of grass into a single swath , " says Broom . <p> Given that there is a plethora of pivot irrigators is North Canterbury , pivot ruts are a hazard of the job . Broom says the improved hydraulic suspension system of the new 1370 floats over the pivot ruts . By comparison , the older Swadro uses springs on the two front rotors , while the new unit has hydraulic accumulators , with adjustment to vary the degree of float , that when combined with the wider jockey tyres , is said to travel better over pivot ruts . <p> " When we hit peak season , we chop until we drop with the forage harvester , so raking is not the ' boy 's job ' with us because it is critical to the whole operation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rows together is not an easy job , but the new Swadro 1370 has stood up to the task without any problems .

" <p> They 've needed everything from horse floats and boats to get their creations to Wellington over the years , but Karl says that participating in WoW has never caused much stress in their relationship . In fact , he reckons WoW has been great for their marriage . " You 've got the ups and the downs , the good and the bad , the ugly and the beautiful . " The couple tend to disappear from social life in the months leading up to WoW , so much so that their friends and family refer to it as their " counselling " time . <p> " We only have cats , no kiddies , which makes it easier because there 's a lot of stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns .

" I ca n't even remember what my entry looks like so it 's gon na be really exciting to see , " says Erna . They will also be looking forward to seeing some of their fellow WoW-heads , a group called " the old trouts " who have been entering since the early noughties . <p> And once they 're back home in Karaka , it will be back to " counselling " they go .

Having alienated myself from my school friends early on with a headfirst dive into evangelical Christianity , my social life throughout most of my teens was concentrated on Sundays . The rest of the week was spent skipping school , self-harming and convincing myself I was being persecuted for Jesus . <p> The turning point came in the form of a long lunch at Christchurch 's pre-quake C1 cafe with a bestie who 'd recently started studying at Otago University . Her account of hall life was nothing short of Narnian : a parallel universe where kids were in charge of their own destinies , jocks were friends with nerds , lions lay down with lambs and sometimes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kindly forked out the fees for my fresh start . And so began Year Zero of the me I am now . <p> I showed up at Carrington College knowing almost no one , but with a self-imposed mandate to socialise , I soon befriended posh pissheads and brainy God botherers and lots of people in between . We 'd all come from somewhere else . Now , we had barely a degree of separation between us . <p> The bonds were cemented fairly swiftly : ours was the final cohort to suffer through many long-standing Scarfie traditions that were axed -- for better or worse -- for subsequent generations . I have never known a dread so incandescent as that which consumed me at Otago 's terminal toga parade : a kilometres-long gauntlet along which thousands of impractically dressed teenagers sprinted in various states of inebriation , while being pelted with home-made missiles by older , gleeful peers . By the end , some of us were drenched ; others were bleeding . But together , we 'd survived . And , electric with our own adrenalin , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only at the age of 31 that I appreciate the rarified beauty of the Dunedin student experience . It was , as far as I 'm concerned , an egalitarian utopia : on arrival , former statuses as head prefect or sporting champion faded into insignificance on this blank social canvas that stretched from the shadow of Signal Hill towards the sea . Come second year , it did n't matter how rich your dad was , your inaugural flat was as freezing and shitty as everyone else 's . Everyone wore the same Kathmandu puffer jacket , drank the same fetid Double Browns , and ended up on the same sticky dance floor on Saturday nights . <p> This was a time and a place for drunken hijinks but we were under no illusions it would last forever .

I set off , along with flatmates outfitted variously as " Pirate Batman " , " Jesus Batman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards the fray . <p> Hours later , I 've pashed a severely platonic friend , blacked out in broad daylight on the Frederick St footpath , and arrived home at sunset in a backless hospital gown . A decade later , the same friend unfurled his yoga mat alongside mine before 8am on a recent Saturday morning . Where once we revelled in suburban decay , today , we perform self-care before sun-up . <p> As much as Dunedin was a playground , it was also a training ground . It was , for example , where I became a journalist , though I did n't recognise this at the time . The stories I produced for the student mag remain some of my best work , notwithstanding an " expos ? " of the city 's least popular property managers , one of whom stormed the office claiming -- not without reason -- that I had defamed him . I wrote about New Zealand 's refugee quota , restorative justice , abortion protestors and , apparently trying to exorcise some latent demon , a piece entitled : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , this eclectic portfolio was enough to land me a job in a mainstream newsroom and launch a career I 'd never planned . <p> Professionally , I was grateful to learn about the concept of " right of reply " in a low-risk context . On the home front , I routinely learned things the hard way . Turns out people do n't have to love you and they also do n't have to live with you . After my first semester of second-year flatting , a flatmate* rang to inform me he and the others would be renewing the lease the following year . I would not be on it . There was no way around this breakdown in relations but through : I had half a year in the house to go and there was no thought of skulking back to Mum and Dad 's . So I went on antidepressants , bucked up my attitude , and I wish I could say I only had to learn that lesson once : your actions have consequences . And karma is a bitch . <p> Amid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any proper grown-ups on the scene , we raised each other : cooking shared dinners from Alison and Simon Holst 's Very Easy Vegetarian Cookbook Sunday to Thursday , weekly flat shopping at the South Dunedin Pak'nSave , and trialing increasingly gruesome methods to annihilate the rat who kept eating our fruit and crapping on our couch . This was the time and place to learn these life skills . I know former Scarfies who , in their late 20s , found themselves housetraining flatmates who 'd stayed at home to study but never learned to load a dishwasher . <p> In the hearts of many who 've passed through , Dunedin can feel more akin to a worldview than a location . Since graduating , I have discovered that the common experience of forging one 's identity near the ends of the earth has been enough to sustain friendships , build new ones , and resurrect those I thought I 'd left behind . In the past year , I 've spoken at these dear ones ' weddings , held their hands at funerals and danced with them barefoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing up together . <p> And , some of us are still flatting . Earlier in the year , I lived alone for the first time on a dodgy street in a drug-addled part of town , an empowering if disquieting experience where I levelled up my adulting even further by killing cockroaches and twiddling screwdrivers . But with a deposit on an off-the-plan apartment , I knew I 'd have to apply for a mortgage , and felt it financially prudent to move back in with a flatmate . <p> In a sparkling twist of fate , the development fell through within days of giving my notice . However , I had no second thoughts about sharing a flat again ; and the house hunt is on indefinite pause . There 's a lot to love about living in community ; Dunedin showed me that . The key is finding the people -- and the place -- that bring out the best in you . It might be a gentrified street with a view of the Sky Tower .

@@93954230 <h> Eight 's Documentary Beyond Conversion To Debut On TVNZ October 11 <p> Eight 's TV documentary BEYOND CONVERSION about the harrowing history of Conversion Therapy in New Zealand is set to launch via TVNZ on October 11 . This is Eight 's 2nd documentary film production , produced via The Story Department . <p> Funded by Irirangi Te Moto - New Zealand On Air and TVNZ , BEYOND CONVERSION is produced by Leanne Pooley and directed by Loren Prendiville and is an intimate look at the fight to ban conversion practices in Aotearoa . BEYOND CONVERSION follows a bill many thought would pass unanimously , but was in-fact highly contested , prompting the largest number of public submissions in New Zealand 's legislative history . This powerful story is told through the voices of Kiwi survivors , who have laid themselves bare to shed light on the impacts of conversion practices . The film explores the complexities of this divisive issue , along with the spectrum of voices and opinions that came to light during the political process . BEYOND CONVERSION is a moving , nuanced conversation about religious freedom , personal identity and the meaning of choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department , Katie Millington says " BEYOND CONVERSION was a must-tell story for us . The film shines a light on the true horrors of the very recent practices of conversion therapy , Loren and Leanne have created a memorable and unflinching film that is powerful and raw in its delivery . It also leaves the viewer with hope as we look toward a brighter future for people of the rainbow community who can now embrace their deserved freedom and choice . " <p> BEYOND CONVERSION director Loren Prendiville 's film career began in 2016 when her background in psychology and her love of storytelling drew her towards documentary filmmaking , she states " BEYOND CONVERSION is a film that 's close to my heart . As a proud queer person and having grown up in a religious environment , I was compelled to bring to light the traumatic experiences of those in my community .

It 's my hope that this film will create conversations amongst families and communities about the importance of celebrating our diversity and protecting our most vulnerable -- regardless of our beliefs .

She was made an Arts Laureate in 2011 , named an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit for Services to Documentary in 2017 and the same year she was admitted to The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences ( The Oscars ) , she comments that " This film is overdue and Loren Prendiville was the right person to make it . I was continually impressed by the depth of Loren 's intelligence , her creative instincts , and her compassion .

@@93978238 <h> Political Roundup : No confidence in dire local govt elections <p> The " No Confidence " vote in local body elections could be as high as 60 per cent by the end of this week . That 's essentially what it is when only 40 per cent of the public choose to vote , which is what is happening at the moment . In fact , voter turnout is trending lower , meaning New Zealand could be headed for a record low voter turnout ( and hence a record no confidence vote in politicians ) . The reality is clear : the vast majority of the public are not inspired by what 's on offer from candidates across the country and voters are n't convinced that voting in local elections really matters . <p> Voter turnout was supposed to increase in 2022 <p> This year 's extremely low voter turnout is occurring despite circumstances that should be driving increased public involvement . Firstly , there are a large number of very competitive mayoral elections taking place -- in which the likely outcome is far from decided . In Auckland , Wellington , Christchurch , Dunedin , and Invercargill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win , and a number of new mayors are likely to be elected . This situation normally drives up turnout . <p> In addition , there are a number of factors that many commentators and authorities believed would drive up participation : <p> The new Maori wards in many elections were supposed to provide for better representation of an historically under-represented demographic <p> There is increased media coverage of local elections and , in particular , a plethora of voices explaining the need for people to vote <p> The Three Waters reforms have provided a contentious public issue for voters to vote for or against as candidates take a pro or anti Three Waters stance <p> A much more demographically diverse range of candidates -- women , Maori , young people , and so forth -- standing was said to help boost turnout amongst sections of the public put off by so-called " pale , stale , and male " incumbents <p> Local government authorities have produced huge publicity and advertising campaigns , normally incorporating te reo Maori and an emphasis on diversity , to get people enthused about democracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a significant impact in lifting voting so far . Perhaps some of these dynamics have actually had a counterintuitively negative impact . <p> Could it be that the low voter turnout reflects contentment ? <p> Of course , there are plenty of explanations for the public choosing not to vote . Some politicians and commentators have been attempting to put a more positive spin on the declining voter turnout . Much of this looks like wishful thinking . They say the declining voter turnout simply reflects public satisfaction with the politicians and their local authorities . Voters are content to just let the politicians continue doing their good work without the scrutiny and evaluation of voting . <p> But there is absolutely no evidence to support the view that the low voter turnout reflects contentment . In fact , there is strong evidence throughout the country that the public 's unhappiness with councils has reached an all-time high . <p> Surveys carried out by local authorities show that dissatisfaction with individual councils is very strong this year . For example , in Wellington , when the public were asked this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who are " satisfied " dropped to a new low of only 12 per cent , while those who said they are " dissatisfied " jumped to 52 per cent . Similarly , those who believe that the Council makes decisions that are in best interests of the city has plummeted from 50 per cent to just 17 per cent this year . <p> TDB Recommends NewzEngine.com <p> It seems that throughout the country there is a similar level of anger and disenchantment with local politicians which should dispel any rosy idea that lower voter turnout is in some way positive . <p> Those pushing the " contentment theory " of low voter turnout also have to grapple with the fact that non-voters are disproportionately made up of the poor and marginalised of society . Evidence shows it 's the wealthier demographics that vote in much larger numbers than others . <p> For example , suburb comparisons in the 2019 Rotorua Lakes Council elections showed that the higher turnouts were from residents from wealthier housing locations , and vice versa . <p> Overall in Rotorua the turnout was 45 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates were much higher , and for the lower socio-economic areas the voting rates were about a third of this . <p> For example , in Rotorua 's flash suburb of Springfield , 59 per cent voted , in leafy Lynmore it was 57 per cent , and wealthy Kaharoa had a turnout rate of 56 per cent . <p> However , the poorer suburbs had abysmal turnout rates . In disadvantaged Western Heights it was only 27 per cent , and in the poorest area of Fordlands voter turnout was an incredible 18 per cent . <p> This pattern was borne out by a 2015 Auckland Council study that showed significant variation in voter turnout according to socioeconomic status . <p> It goes to show just how much participation in elections is a function of socio-economics . And so , a discussion of voter turnout must involve an awareness that elections in New Zealand are primarily determined by wealth . <p> It seems that local government is n't working for most people . And this is especially the case for the poor . Increasingly there is a feeling that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dysfunctional and captured by vested interests and elites . <p> All around the world voter turnout has generally been on the decline over the last few decades , driven by waning trust in authorities and politics . And this is evident in the rise of populist nationalism and the increased peddling of conspiracy theories . <p> A 17 per cent turnout in amongst poorer communities speaks to something rotten in our democratic processes . Fixing this wo n't involve superficial and mechanical changes to voting systems or just more public education . A much bigger examination of the failings of our political system is necessary , and this needs to include looking at wider societal problems . <p> Without big change , our elections will decline further in legitimacy . As today 's New Zealand Herald points out , the Prime Minister is being " asked this week to speculate on how low the turnout threshold should be for local elections to be considered valid " . She wo n't answer this . But someone is going to have to engage very quickly . <p> What is clear is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system of local government is not the answer . The public -- and especially poorer New Zealanders -- will just keep essentially voting " No confidence " in larger and larger numbers until it 's impossible for this message to be ignored or misunderstood . <h> 3 COMMENTS <p> " In Auckland , Wellington , Christchurch , Dunedin , and Invercargill , for instance , it 's not clear who will win " <p> Well here in Christchurch one of the candidates Mr Maugher believes he has already won three weeks ago and began having meetings with " like minded " councillors and candidates about what they were going to do when he had won . <p> For the first time in 36 years I tore up my ballot paper and I do n't regret joining many thousands of others who wo n't be casting a vote because every three years its the same . I promise to listen , I promise to act , I will get things done , I am independent but you will never know which way I will vote , I am going to support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earthquake damage ten years after the event and so on and this area has been ignored by council . <p> All I see is neglect , blocked drains , weeds and unkempt areas , graffiti , rubbish everywhere , broken dangerous foot paths , vacant land that is left to the vandals the litter and the weeds . <p> I think most of these things get neglected because to fix any of it does not return a profit which reflects how this country is run in other words no profit wo n't do ! <p> Local government is more about squeezing hard pressed ratepayers by adding on ridiculous costs to do anything and suffocating bureaucracy . They are legalised gangsters and they want to be re elected every three years to continue acting like a dictatorship . <p> People wonder what is the point of voting when a Central Government power rides in and forces unwanted cycle lanes tries to steal our water system allow 3 story buildings blocking out the sun and fails to look after it own homes and the people that reside in them . <h> STAY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ' TheDailyBlog.co.nz ' unites New Zealand 's leading left/centre-left commentators and progressive opinion shapers to provide the other side of the story on today 's news , media and political agendas.

In what Kyiv describes as Moscow 's response to its defeats , President Vladimir Putin has incorporated four partially occupied regions of Ukraine . <p> The annexations , widely dismissed as illegal , have raised fears of a possible escalation in the seven-month war . Putin and other senior Russian officials have suggested that nuclear weapons - possibly smaller , tactical weapons - could be used to defend those areas , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared to do so . <p> Speaking in English at the president 's office in Kyiv , Zelensky said : " They begin to prepare their society . That 's very dangerous . <p> " They are not ready to do it , to use it . But they begin to communicate . They do n't know whether they 'll use or not use it . I think it 's dangerous to even speak about it . " <p> Then , in Ukrainian , he said through a translator : " What we see is that Russia 's people in power like life and thus I think the risk of using nuclear weapons is not that definite as some experts say , because they understand that there is no turning back after using it , not only the history of their country , but themselves as personalities . " <p> However , he denied having called for strikes on Russia during an online event on Thursday , saying the Ukrainian word he had used had been misunderstood . <p> The initial comment was denounced by Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said it demonstrated why Russia was right to launch its operation in Ukraine . <p> " After that translation , " President Zelensky said , " they the Russians did their way , how it 's useful for them , and began to retranslate it in other directions . " <p> The interview happened hours after US President Joe Biden said that the Russian threat to use nuclear weapons had brought the world closer to " Armageddon " than at any time since the Cuban Missile Crisis during the Cold War . <p> Zelensky said action was needed now , as Russia 's threats were a " risk for the whole planet " . Moscow , he claimed , had " made a step already " by occupying the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant , Europe 's largest nuclear station which Putin is trying to turn into Russian property . <p> Around 500 Russian troops were at the plant , he said , although the Ukrainian staff still operate it . <p> " The world can stop urgently the actions of Russian occupiers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanction package in such cases and do everything to make them leave the nuclear power plant . " <p> Empowered by sophisticated Western-supplied weapons , the Ukrainian army has made significant advances in the east and the south , reclaiming towns and villages even in areas the Kremlin claims are now part of Russia . <p> Zelensky said Russian forces were putting up a " good enough fight " , but that Ukraine had received weapons - " I wo n't say we have enough now " - and soldiers were motivated to push forward . <p> The Russian military 's setbacks , a major embarrassment for President Putin , have sparked unusual criticism of the country 's military . <p> Amid the losses , President Putin announced the mobilisation of hundreds of thousands of reservists , which led to rare anti-war protests in Russia and to a huge exodus of military-age men . <p> President Zelensky urged Russians to " fight for your body , rights and soul " , saying : " These mobilised kids now , they come without machine guns , armoured jackets , they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be kebab ... they need to fight for their lives . <p> " All Putin is afraid of is not a nuclear strike , " he said .

" <p> According to the ERA , a former co-worker said he recalled Dhiman regularly working 50-55 hours per week . <p> Dhiman 's annual leave was extremely limited while working for Mann . <p> In 2018 , he took just his second period of leave , returning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arranged by his parents . <p> But even in granting the leave Dhiman was owed , Mann became threatening . <p> " He told me , okay , okay , yeah , that 's fine , you can go . <p> " But make sure you do n't take more days . <p> " If you want one more week , then you do n't have to come back , you have to just stay there . " <p> The couple spending so little time together meant Dhiman 's wife had a long struggle ahead in obtaining a visa . <p> She only joined Dhiman in New Zealand earlier this year after four years of marriage . <p> In 2016 , Dhiman was granted a three-year essential work visa as a store manager for the pizza store in Flat Bush . <p> He said he continued to work 50-57 hours a week and continued to be paid for less . <p> In November 2019 , Mann sold the pizza store to another employee . <p> Dhiman said he was forced to continue working there as manager , fearing his visa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . <p> But in 2020 , after eight years of being underpaid and exploited , Dhiman had finally had enough and resigned . <p> He took his case to migrant rights advocate Sehgal , who fought on his behalf . <p> At this point , Mann approached Dhiman 's brother , threatening his family with repercussions . <p> When the case was picked up by the ERA , Mann denied involvement in the breaches of minimum entitlements but conceded that some payments in respect of public holidays were owed . <p> At an investigation meeting on 6 July , Mann did not provide a written statement or any evidence . <p> When the ERA told Mann he would be under oath , he abruptly left , saying that the entire process was a " set up " . <p> When contacted by RNZ , Mann said he would be laying corruption charges against Dhiman 's advocates . <p> But when asked about underpaying his staff , Mann hung up the phone . <p> Dhiman was now working as a pizza store manager under a different employer in Huntly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , he said he was happy that justice would be served . <p> The ERA ordered Mann to pay Dhiman within 28 days of the determination . <p> The payment awarded included $69,981 in arrears of wages , $28,153.14 in arrears of holiday pay , and interest on the two amounts .

@@94083232 <p> Employees are often warned about the data exposure risks associated with the likes of phishing emails , credential theft , and using weak passwords . <p> However , they can risk leaking or exposing sensitive information about themselves , the work they do , or their organisation without even realising . <p> This risk frequently goes unexplored in cybersecurity awareness training , leaving employees oblivious to the risks they can pose to the security of data which , if exposed , could be exploited both directly and indirectly to target workers and businesses for malicious gain . <p> Here are eight unusual , unexpected , and relatively strange ways employees can accidentally expose data , along with advice for addressing and mitigating the risks associated with them . <p> Video conferencing platforms such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams have become a staple of remote/hybrid working . However , new academic research has found that bespectacled video conferencing participants may be at risk of accidentally exposing information via the reflection of their eyeglasses . <p> Using mathematical modelling and human subject experiments , the research explored the extent to which webcams leak recognisable textual and graphical information gleaming from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a controlled lab setting show it is possible to reconstruct and recognise with over 75 per cent accuracy on-screen texts that have heights as small as 10 mm with a 720p webcam , " the researchers wrote . " We further applied this threat model to web textual contents with varying attacker capabilities to find thresholds at which text becomes recognisable . " <p> The 20-participant study found that present-day 720p webcams are sufficient for adversaries to reconstruct textual content on big-font websites , while the evolution toward 4K cameras will tip the threshold of text leakage to reconstruction of most header texts on popular websites . <p> Such capabilities in the hands of a malicious actor could potentially threaten the security of some confidential and sensitive data . The research proposed near-term mitigations including a software prototype that users can use to blur the eyeglass areas of their video streams . <p> " For possible long-term defences , we advocate an individual reflection testing procedure to assess threats under various settings and justify the importance of following the principle of least privilege for privacy-sensitive scenarios , " the researchers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new hire SMS " phishing attacks <p> On professional networking site LinkedIn , it 's common for people to post upon starting a new role , updating their profile to reflect their latest career move , experience , and place of work . <p> However , this seemingly innocuous act can open new starters to so-called " new hire SMS " phishing attacks , whereby attackers scour LinkedIn for new job posts , look up a new hire 's phone number on a data brokerage site , and send SMS phishing messages pretending to be a senior executive from within the company , trying to trick them during the first weeks of their new job . <p> As detailed by social engineering expert and SocialProof Security CEO Rachel Tobac , these messages typically ask for gift cards or bogus money transfers , but they have been known to request login details or sensitive decks . <p> " I 've seen an increase in the new hire SMS phish attack method recently , " she wrote on Twitter , adding that it has become so common that most organisations she works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new starters to limit posts about their new roles . <p> These are good mitigative steps for reducing the risks of new hire SMS phishing scams , Tobac stated , and security teams should also educate new employees about these attacks , outlining what genuine communication from the firm will look like and what methods will be used . <p> She also recommended providing employees with DeleteMe to remove their contact details from data brokerage sites . <p> Users may not associate posting pictures on their personal social media and messaging apps as posing a risk to sensitive corporate information , but as Dmitry Bestuzhev , most distinguished threat researcher at BlackBerry , tells CSO , accidental data disclosure via social apps such as Instagram , Facebook , and WhatsApp is a very real threat . <p> " People like taking photos but sometimes they forget about their surroundings , " Bestuzhev said . <p> " So , it 's common to find sensitive documents on the table , diagrams on the wall , passwords on sticky notes , authentication keys and unlocked screens with applications open on the desktop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use for nefarious activities . " <p> It 's easy for employees to forget that , on an unlocked screen , it 's simple to spot which browser they use , what antivirus products they are connected to , and so on , Bestuzhev adds . " This is all valuable information for attackers and can so easily be exposed in photos on Instagram , Facebook , and WhatsApp status updates . " <p> Keiron Holyome , VP UKI , Eastern Europe , Middle East , and Africa at BlackBerry , emphasises the importance of security education and awareness about this issue . <p> " Companies ca n't stop employees taking and sharing photos , but they can highlight the risks and cause employees to stop and think about what they are posting , " he said . <p> 4 . Data ingestion script mistypes result in incorrect database use <p> Speaking to CSO , Tom Van de Wiele , principal threats and technology researcher at WithSecure , says his team has treated some unusual cases whereby a simple mistype of an IP address or URL for a data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " This then results in a mixed database that needs to be sanitised or rolled back before the back-up process kicks in or else the organisation might have a PII personally identifiable information incident that violates GDPR , " he adds . " Companies deal with data mixing incidents on a regular basis and sometimes the operations are irreversible if a succession of failures occurs too far back in the past . " <p> Van de Wiele therefore advises security teams to leverage the authentication aspect of TLS where possible . <p> " This will lower the risk of mistaken identity of servers and databases but understand that the risk can not be fully eliminated -- so act and prepare accordingly by making sure you have logs in place that are acted upon as part of a larger detection and monitoring strategy . That includes successful as well as unsuccessful events , " he adds . <p> Van de Wiele also advocates enforcing strict rules , processes , awareness , and security controls on how and when to use **41;1011;TOOLONG environments . <p> " This will result in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real product data and ensures that any kind of update or change as a result of the discovery of a security issue can be tested thoroughly in pre-production environments . " <p> Naming servers so that they can be distinguished from each other versus going over-board with abbreviations is another useful tip , as is performing security testing in production , he says . " Invest in detection and monitoring as one of the compensating controls for this and test to make sure detection works within expectations . " <p> " This information can be used by attackers to footprint the company , compile a list of valid username or email addresses , target phishing emails and , in some cases , target development systems , which may have fewer security controls , for takeover and lateral movement .

" Administrators should also train users on what goes into a CT log so they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Innocent " USB hardware become a backdoor for attackers <p> Employees may be inclined to purchase and use their own hardware such as USB fans or lamps with their corporate laptops , but CyberArk malware research team leader Amir Landau warns that these seemingly innocent gadgets can be used as backdoors to a user 's device and the wider business network . Such hardware attacks typically have three main attack vectors , he says : <p> " Malicious-by-design hardware , where devices come with pre-installed malware on them , with one example known as BadUSB . BadUSBs can be purchased very easily on AliExpress , or people can make their own with open sources , such as USB Rubber Ducky , from any USB device . " <p> Next are worm infections -- also called replication through removable media -- where USB devices are infected by worms , such as USBferry and Raspberry Robin . <p> Third are compromised hardware supply chains . " As part of a supply chain attack , bad software or chips are installed inside legitimate hardware , like in the case of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used by Amazon and Apple in 2018 . " <p> Detecting these kinds of attacks at the endpoint is difficult , but antivirus and endpoint detection and response can , in some cases , protect against threats by monitoring the execution flow of extended devices and validating code integrity policies , Landau says . <p> " Privileged access management ( PAM ) solutions are also important due to their ability to block the USB ports to unprivileged users and prevent unauthorised code . " <p> 7 . Discarded office printers offer up Wi-Fi passwords <p> When an old office printer stops working or is replaced by a newer model , employees could be forgiven for simply discarding it for recycling . If this is done without first wiping data such as Wi-Fi passwords , it can open an organisation up to data exposure risks . <p> Van de Wiele has seen this firsthand . " Criminals extracted the passwords and used them to log onto the network of the organisation in order to steal PII , " he says . <p> He advises encrypting data at rest and in use/transit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key for end-point devices in general . " Make sure removable media are under control , that data is always encrypted , and that recovery is possible through a formal process with the necessary controls in place . " <p> Avishai Avivi , CISO at SafeBreach , recounts an incident where a non-malicious email sent by an employee for the purpose of training almost led to the exposure of data including customers ' Social Security numbers . <p> " As part of the training of new associates , the training team took a real spreadsheet that contained customers ' SSNs , and simply hid the columns containing all the SSNs , " he tells CSO . <p> " They then provided this modified spreadsheet to the trainees . The employee was looking to continue training at home , and simply emailed the spreadsheet to his personal email account . " <p> Thankfully , the firm had a reactive data leak protection ( DLP ) control monitoring all employee emails , which detected the existence of multiple SSNs in the attachment , blocked the email , and alerted the SOC . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be exposed by even the most genuine , benevolent of actions . <p> " Rather than relying on reactive controls , we should have had better data classification preventative controls that would have indicated the movement of real SSN data from the production environment into a file in the training department , a control which would have stopped the employee from even attempting to email the attachment out to a personal email account , " Avivi says . <h> Microsites <h> Featured <h> Slideshows <h> Channel gathers for Nextgen New Zealand 's Summer ( Somewhere ) Party <p> Held in Auckland , Nextgen New Zealand 's Summer ( Somewhere ) Party was an opportunity for celebration with a tangerine taste of summer .

@@94083233 <p> Agile development teams must ensure that microservices , applications , and databases are observable , have monitoring in place to identify operational issues , and use AIops to correlate alerts into manageable incidents . <p> When users and business stakeholders want enhancements , many devops teams follow agile methodologies to process feedback and deploy new versions . <p> Even if there are few requests , devops teams know they must upgrade apps and patch underlying components ; otherwise , the software developed today will become tomorrow 's technical debt . <p> The life-cycle management of machine learning models is more complex than software . <p> Andy Dang , co-founder and head of engineering at WhyLabs , explains , " model development life cycle resembles software development life cycle from a high level , but with much more complexity . We treat software as code , but data , the foundation of an ML model , is complex , highly dimensional , and its behaviour is unpredictable . " <p> In addition to code , components , and infrastructure , models are built using algorithms , configuration , and training data sets . These are selected and optimised at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change over time . <p> Why monitor machine learning models ? <p> Like monitoring applications for performance , reliability , and error conditions , machine learning model monitoring provides data scientists visibility on model performance . ML monitoring is especially important when models are used for predictions or when the ML runs on datasets with high volatility . <p> Dmitry Petrov , cofounder and CEO of Iterative , says , " The main goals around model monitoring focus on performance and troubleshooting as ML teams want to be able to improve on their models and ensure everything is running as intended . " <p> " Monitoring can help businesses balance the benefits of AI predictions with their need for predictable outcomes , " he says . " Automated alerts can help ML operations teams detect outliers in real time , giving them time to respond before any harm occurs . " <p> Stu Bailey , cofounder of ModelOp , adds , " Coupling robust monitoring with automated remediation accelerates time to resolution , which is key for maximising business value and reducing risk . " <p> In particular , data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AI models are often probabilistic , meaning they can generate a range of results , " says Kayala . <p> " Sometimes , models can produce an outlier , an outcome significantly outside the normal range . Outliers can be disruptive to business outcomes and often have major negative consequences if they go unnoticed . To ensure AI models are impactful in the real world , ML teams should also monitor trends and fluctuations in product and business metrics that AI impacts directly . " <p> For example , let 's consider predicting a stock 's daily price . When there 's low market volatility , algorithms such as the long short-term memory ( LSTM ) can provide rudimentary predictions , and more comprehensive deep learning algorithms can improve accuracy . But most models will struggle to make accurate predictions when markets are highly volatile , and model monitoring can alert for these conditions . <p> Another type of ML model performs classifications , and precision and recall metrics can help track accuracy . <p> Precision measures the true positives against the ones the model selected , while recall tracks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on ML model drift , such as concept drift when the underlying statistics of what 's being predicted change , or data drift when the input data changes . <p> A third concern is explainable ML , where models are stressed to determine which input features contribute most significantly to the results . This issue relates to model bias , where the training data has statistical flaws that skew the model to make erroneous predictions . <p> These issues can erode trust and create significant business issues.Model performance management aims to address them across the development , training , deployment , and monitoring phases . <p> " To ensure ML models are not unduly discriminating , enterprises need solutions that deliver context and visibility into model behaviours throughout the entire life cycle -- from model training and validation to analysis and improvement , " says Kenthapadi . <p> Josh Poduska , chief field data scientist at Domino Data Lab , says , " Model monitoring is a critical , ongoing process . To improve future accuracy for a model that has drifted , retrain it with fresher data , along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the current reality . " <p> Ira Cohen , chief data scientist and cofounder at Anodot , shares important factors in ML model monitoring . " First , models should monitor output and input features ' behaviour , as shifts in the input features can cause issues , " he says . He suggests using proxy measures when model performance can not be measured directly or quickly enough . <p> Cohen says data scientists need tools for model monitoring . He says , " Monitoring models manually is not scalable , and dashboards and reports are not equipped to handle the complexity and volume of the monitoring data generated when many AI models are deployed . " <p> Here are some recommended practices for ML model monitoring and performance management . Petrov recommends , " Ensure you have the tools and automation in place upstream at the beginning of the model development life cycle to support your monitoring needs . " <p> Meanwhile , Dang says , " Data engineers and scientists should run preliminary validations to ensure their data is in the expected format . As the data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should enable data unit testing through validations and constraint checks . " <p> Cohen suggests , " Use scalable anomaly detection algorithms that learn the behaviour of each model 's inputs and outputs to alert when they deviate from the norm , effectively using AI to monitor AI . " <p> In addition , Kayala says , " Track the drift in the distribution of features . A large change in distribution indicates the need to retrain our models to achieve optimal performance . " <p> Also , Bailey adds , " Increasingly , organisations are looking to monitor model risk and ROI as part of more comprehensive model governance programs , ensuring that models meet business and technical KPIs . " <p> Software development largely focuses on maintaining the code , monitoring application performance , improving reliability , and responding to operational and security incidents .

" Danny has been pretty heavily involved in the debrief and has seen some drafts . He is coming off contract and after discussions with the high performance and player welfare committee , we decided we would go to market . " <p> The move to make Hay reapply for the role has been interpreted as a vote of no confidence in the 47-year-old , with the view that he would have been in a no-win situation if he chose to enter the process overseen by the board and NZF hierarchy . <p> But Pragnell refutes the idea that it was a mere gesture , saying Hay would have been assessed like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100 per cent genuine , " said Pragnell .

Video / Mark Mitchell <p> Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern , Agriculture Minister Damien O'Connor , and Climate Change Minister James Shaw are making an announcement in the Wairarapa on the Government 's plan to reduce agricultural emissions . Video / Mark Mitchell <p> The Government claims its plan for pricing agriculture emissions is pretty much what the farming sector said it wanted , so why the rural uproar with claims farmers and their communities will be wiped out ? <p> What'sin the Government 's proposal for reducing agricultural greenhouse gases that 's different enough from the $51 billion-plus sector 's own blueprint to provoke Federated Farmers into calling it " a gut-wrenching " outcome that will " rip the heart out of small town New Zealand " ? <p> The first thing to know is New Zealand , whose economy relies heavily on agriculture export production , is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price on agricultural emissions . <p> Second is that to date , the sector has not been pulled into the well-established Emissions Trading Scheme , despite howls of protest from environmentalists but after recognition from experts that its variables and special features would be like forcing a square peg into a round hole . <p> There are only two areas of major difference between what the Government is proposing and what He Waka Eke Noa ( HWEN ) , the primary sector climate action partnership that came up with agriculture 's blueprint , recommended - but in those , it seems they might as well be talking different languages . ( The Government was represented on HWEN ) . <p> New Zealand is the first country in the world to try to put a price on agricultural emissions . Photo / Supplied <p> The two big contrasts are in their views on emissions pricing and carbon sequestration recognition . ( Carbon sequestration is the process of storing carbon - carbon dioxide is naturally captured from the atmosphere through biological - think farming , think forestry , grasslands , tree planting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to HWEN , in both areas , what the Government wants to do will particularly hurt the country 's sheep and beef farmers , backbone of the $12 billion red meat export industry . <p> HWEN programme director Kelly Forster says under the Government 's pricing proposal , unveiled this week , it might hit its emissions reduction target but in doing so , wipe out 20 per cent of sheep and beef farmers . <h> Advertisement <p> " They 've said in their report socio-economic impacts could be considered but are second to achieving the targets . <p> " Obviously that is something the sector ca n't stand behind . " <p> But why would sheep and beef farmers be hit by emissions pricing more than dairy farmers ? <p> " There 's an assumption dairy farmers are worse in terms of emissions but that 's not the reality . Yes , sheep and beef farm emissions are significantly lower per hectare , but they have a lot more hectares , " says Forster . <p> That means a sheep and beef farm could have similar total emissions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " The atmosphere does n't care if it ( emissions ) comes from one or two hectares . It just sees a kilogram of methane . The reason why the burden falls more heavily on the sheep and beef sector is they do n't make as much money as dairy , " says Forster . <p> A Government paper discussing the impacts of the Government proposal seems to support HWEN 's view that achieving its emissions target overrides socio-economic considerations . <p> " If agriculture emissions are not priced , or if the price is too low to reduce emissions , Aotearoa New Zealand is unlikely to achieve its emissions reduction goals . In this event , the Government will have choices about how to make up the shortfall ... Other sectors may be required to pick up some of the shortfall in reductions needed . " <h> Advertisement <p> The paper notes any form of agricultural emissions pricing system will have " significant " flow-on effects for wider society and the general public , the economy is likely to be affected , including exports , land use in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consumers of some food and fibre products may change . <p> HWEN worked for more than two years on its recommended blueprint of how the sector should implement an emissions reduction framework by 2025 , after the primary sector won its long argument against being pulled into the ETS . <p> In the area of how emissions should be priced , HWEN recommended an oversight board to advise on prices with ministers making the final decision . The Government wants Crown entity the Climate Change Commission to advise those ministers on price setting . <p> HWEN wanted separate levy rates for short and long-lived gas emissions and a separate price for sequestration . It urged a careful trajectory towards setting rates , with consideration given to the availability and cost of on-farm mitigations , social and economic impacts on farmers and their communities , and the risk of " emissions leakage " as overseas agriculture competitors cashed in on New Zealand 's global-busting move . <p> He Waka Eke Noa programme director Kelly Forster . Photo / Supplied <p> How the Government has responded to this , says HWEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfied that price is sufficient to meet targets " . <p> Still on emissions pricing , while HWEN and the Government agree a unique levy should be set for methane emissions , HWEN wanted a price ceiling - the Government proposes no ceiling . <p> HWEN wanted the levy for long-lived gas emissions initially set at the level required to cover sequestration and regime admin costs and to fund action , research and development . The Government wants the prices of long-lived gas emissions set annually and linked to the New Zealand unit price , with a proportional discount starting at 95 per cent and phased down to 1 per cent a year . <p> As for their differences when it comes to recognising sequestration , HWEN 's Forster says that 's " pretty easy " to grasp . <p> " There are a lot of different categories of sequestration . We broke them into categories to make it practical to apply a calculating framework of rewarding them ( farmer and grower sequestration efforts ) . <p> " Of the eight or so categories we recognised , they are recognising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sheep and beef sector . We know they have more opportunities to plant trees so that exacerbates the challenges the sector will have with an emissions price but also , it does n't hit a general sense of fairness ... you are being charged on your emissions but you are also not being recognised for sequestration happening on your farm . " <p> Beef+Lamb NZ says red meat farmers have more than 1.4 million hectares of native forest on their land absorbing carbon . It says it 's only fair this is recognised by the new emissions pricing regime from day one . <p> HWEN wanted recognition of additional on-farm sequestration from a wide range of permanent and cyclical forms of vegetation to offset the cost of the emissions levy . It recommended that from 2025 , the new scheme should recognise vegetation that is part of existing planting programmes , and from 2027 , it should recognise all categories of vegetation and back date recognition to 2025 . <p> Longer term , HWEN wanted sequestration transitioned into the ETS once the ETS was improved and expanded . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rewarding sequestration from riparian margins planted after 2008 , and reward , through contract payments , additional sequestration from active management of indigenous vegetation . <p> The Government also proposes a portion of the levy be set aside for sequestration payments , an application process , and a contract set for a number of years . <p> Long-term , the Government proposed incorporating vegetation categories into the ETS , and said it was considering an approach to " propose new categories " for inclusion in the ETS " where an individual pays for science and measurement . " <p> The Government says agriculture accounts for nearly half of New Zealand 's gross greenhouse gas emissions . They mainly come through methane -- burped out by ruminant livestock like cattle , sheep and deer -- but also from nitrous oxide , stemming from sources like fertiliser and cow urine . <p> The Government has committed New Zealand to becoming a world leader in climate change action . <p> A new domestic emissions reduction target by 2050 was set into law in November 2019 with the Climate Change Response ( Zero Carbon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 ( other than for biogenic methane ) . <p> The Government established the Climate Change Commission in December 2019 to : provide advice to Government on climate change mitigation and adaptation and monitor progress towards the new 2050 target emissions budgets and the implementation of a National Adaptation Plan .

@@94272234 <h> Some screen time better than none during young people 's concussion recovery <p> " It appears that spending too little or too much time on screens is n't ideal for concussion recovery . " Photo by larryvincent <p> Too much screen time can slow young people 's recovery from concussions , but new Canadian research suggests that banning screen time is not the answer . <p> Scientists from the University of British Columbia and the University of Calgary looked for links between the self-reported screen time of more than 700 youngsters aged 8 to 16 in the first 7 to 10 days following a concussion , and symptoms reported by them and their caregivers over the following six months . <p> The children whose concussion symptoms cleared up the fastest had engaged in a moderate amount of screen time . <p> " We 've been calling this the ' Goldilocks ' group , because it appears that spending too little or too much time on screens is n't ideal for concussion recovery , " said Dr Molly Cairncross , an assistant professor at Simon Fraser University . <p> Cairncross conducted the research while a postdoctoral fellow working with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Columbia 's psychology department . The study findings are reported in the journal Pediatrics . <p> She continued : " Our findings show that the common recommendation to avoid smartphones , computers and televisions as much as possible may not be what 's best for kids . " <p> The study was part of a larger concussion project called Advancing Concussion Assessment in Pediatrics ( A-CAP ) led by psychology professor Dr Keith Yeates at the University of Calgary and funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research . <p> The data came from participants aged 8 to 16 who had suffered either a concussion or an orthopaedic injury , such as a sprained ankle or broken arm , and sought care at one of five emergency departments in Canada . <p> The purpose of including children who had orthopaedic injuries was to compare their recoveries with the group who had concussions . <p> Patients in the concussion group generally had relatively worse symptoms than their counterparts with orthopaedic injuries , but within the concussion group it was not simply a matter of symptoms worsening with more screen time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Kids use smartphones and computers to stay connected with peers , so complete removal of those screens could lead to feelings of disconnection , loneliness and not having social support , " Cairncross said . <p> " Those things are likely to have a negative effect on kids ' mental health and that can make recovery take longer . " <p> The study differed from another conducted last year in the United States in that it tracked screen time and recovery over a longer period . The earlier study found that screen time slowed recovery , but it measured screen use only in the first 48 hours and symptoms for only 10 days . <p> The longer timeline led to another interesting finding , described by Silverberg : " The amount of time spent in front of screens during the early recovery period made little difference to long-term health outcomes . <p> " After 30 days , children who suffered a concussion or another type of injury reported similar symptoms , regardless of their early screen use . " <p> The researchers also observed that screen time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as the patient 's sex , age , sleep habits , physical activity or pre-existing symptoms . <p> " Screen time did n't make a lot of difference relative to several other factors that we know can affect concussion recovery , " Yeates said . " Encouraging concussion patients to sleep well and gradually engage in light physical activity will likely do a lot more for their recovery than keeping them off their smartphones . " <p> Ultimately , the findings suggest that blanket restrictions on screen time might not be helpful for children and adolescents with concussions . Instead , the researchers suggest using the same approach as with other activities , which is moderation . If symptoms flare up , screen time can always be limited . <h> Ad Blocker Detected ! <p> We have detected that you are using browser extensions to block ads .

Send your questions through to our experts at questions@nzherald.co.nz . <p> My parents divorced when I was 8 . It was a messy separation and Ispent years listening to them slag each other off . Now , 25 years later , they have rekindled their relationship and are looking to remarry . I 'm having a hard time accepting and being supportive of it . What should I do ? - Ben <p> Hello Ben , <p> Decades ago , when we trained as Family Court counsellors , a core principle we learned was that " every child is made up of half of their mother and half of their father " . Consequently , if you denigrate one of their parents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unacceptable . It must be galling to have years of that from your parents only to find that it was all for nothing . <p> The sad reality is that some people are so lacking in self-awareness and so caught up in their own pain that they can not sustain a long-term relationship . To make matters worse for their kids , those same limitations may make them unskilful and unempathetic parents . So they are oblivious to the harm they do their kids as they throw their upset about separation around . Unfortunately , the research is clear that hostile or combative separations typically leave children distressed , conflicted and stuck in some simplistic thinking about their parent 's relationship and why they separated . <p> If that description fits your parents , it is not surprising that you struggle to accept and support the rekindling of their relationship . Of course , it would be much easier for them ( and maybe others in the family ) if you did , but there 's nothing that says you have to . If your parents made a series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's on them , not you . <p> However , we can appreciate that being distanced and distressed by your parents ' renewed relationship is not a happy place for you either . Here are some suggestions to see if you can create a more workable situation for yourself . <p> The first is to see if you can find a place of compassionate understanding with which to view your parents ' behaviour . At 33 , you perhaps have had some relationship experience of your own . You may have experiences that will help you develop a more nuanced adult understanding of what the " slagging off " represented . Have you ever had a painful break-up yourself ? The pain is often related to unresolved feelings . <h> Advertisement <p> Hating someone is a very engaged relationship . The opposite of love is not hate , but indifference . In our experience , when people simply no longer care for each other , they typically exhibit apathy toward each other rather than energetic hostility . When couples have truly stopped caring , their separation can have an inevitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So is it possible for you to see that your parents ' ongoing distress represented " unfinished business " with each other ? <p> The slagging off may have indicated that your parents still cared deeply for each other and felt great distress that the relationship had ended . When humans experience emotional threat or pain , it triggers a frightened animal 's " fight , flight or freeze " response . If you are indifferent to someone , you are unlikely to feel threatened by them . But the more they matter to you , the more not getting on with them seems like a threat . Getting angry and blaming or speaking unpleasantly about the other person becomes a defensive response to the emotional danger of someone you love hurting you . <p> If neither of them was ready to " look in their own mirror " and see what they needed to own about their unhelpful patterns in their relationship , then their only recourse was to blame and be judgemental . An excellent way to avoid self-responsibility is to blame it all on the other person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accept their choice to remarry . One is whether they are willing to acknowledge what they have put you through in their selfish offloading of their pain about the separation . The other is them helping you make sense of it . We suspect the former may be the more critical piece . <p> You will have to make a judgement call about whether you think your parents have the self-awareness and courage to own the consequences for you of their behaviour . Even if you fear they are n't , it is almost certainly worth you making an initial attempt . <p> We suggest that you do some reflection on the impacts on you before you talk to them . Discuss with a friend , partner , sibling or therapist to clarify how you were affected . Alternatively , you could journal -- explore your thoughts and feelings on paper or a screen . Write without censoring or judging what comes out . <p> Then invite your parents ( either separately or together ) to help you with an issue affecting your relationship with them . Ask if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have impacted on you . You do n't have to persist if they are immediately defensive or deflective . However , if they are open , share what their slagging off each other meant to you . Even if you end up with a defensive response from them , many people find it frees them up when they express their reality to those responsible . <p> The other discussion you might want is to ask them to help you understand how they could go from slagging each other off for years to remarrying . Try not to come across as interrogating , accusing or expressing incredulity . Instead , we recommend that you ask in a genuinely curious way if they could help you with your struggle to be understanding and supportive of this significant change in their attitude to each other . How did this happen to them ? How do they make sense of the years of animosity and slagging off ? <h> Advertisement <p> If they simply reply , " Things change " , ask them to explain this further . How did it change for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to say about the other ? Do they still stand by them as a fact about the other person or more as an expression of something else ? If so , what was that " something else " ? <p> It can be very liberating to step into an " adult-to-adult " reflective conversation with our ageing parents . Of course , there is a risk that they do not want to be open and vulnerable with you . Still , at least they will understand if you are not so enthusiastic in your support for what they are doing . You will have likely demonstrated more capacity to risk vulnerability than they were when they were around your age . There is even a possibility that they might respect you for taking the risk to try to connect more deeply with them both in their rekindled relationship . <p> * Verity &amp; Nic are psychologists and family therapists who have specialised in relationship and sex therapy for more than 25 years .

Commitment To Peace <h> The TPLF and a Commitment to Peace <p> 24 October 2022 <p> Dr. Fikrejesus Amahazion <p> Events in Ethiopia continue to rapidly develop . Ethiopian federal forces have taken control of a string of major towns and cities in Tigray Region in recent days , and they are now reported to be on the outskirts of Mekelle , the regional capital . Meanwhile , high-level delegations from both the Ethiopian government and the TPLF have reportedly flown to South Africa for much-awaited peace talks . <p> Like all conflicts , the one that has been raging in northern Ethiopia during the past two years has been fought both on the ground and along the information front . Within the latter battle , a recurring , ever-present element has been disinformation . In fact , disinformation has remained central and dominant since the very beginning of the conflict . For instance , mere hours after the Tigray People 's Liberation Front ( TPLF ) initiated the conflict with its unprovoked November 2020 attack on Ethiopia 's northern command outposts , the group 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been numerous other examples of disinformation throughout the duration of the devastating conflict , one of the most persistent and harmful surrounds the claims that the TPLF is genuinely " committed to peace " . The historical record , spanning recent years and past decades , clearly shows that this frequently propagated notion is a total inversion of truth . <p> Blocking peace and violating international law <p> Between 1998 and 2000 , Eritrea and TPLF-led Ethiopia waged a bitter war . While the conflict was partly based on a dispute over the precise location of extensive parts of the boundary between Eritrea and Ethiopia , the fundamental root cause was , in the words of the eminent regional historian Alemseged Tesfai , " the TPLF 's persistent incursions into Eritrean territory , an act that can only be explained in terms of the expansionist tendencies of that Front 's leadership " . <p> Ultimately , the war led to the deaths of tens of thousands on both sides , caused large-scale displacement of civilians , and was highly costly for both countries and the wider region . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Algiers was signed , and then in December 2000 , President Isaias Afwerki and Prime Minister Meles Zenawi signed the Algiers Peace Agreement . Inter-alia , the agreement called for both parties to permanently terminate hostilities and refrain from the threat or use of force , established an independent and impartial Boundary Commission to delimit and demarcate borders based on pertinent colonial treaties ( from 1900 , 1902 , and 1908 ) and applicable international law , sought to determine the conflict 's origins , and established a Claims Commission to assess damages and losses caused by the conflict . <p> Subsequently , in 2001 , the Eritrea Ethiopia Boundary Commission ( EEBC ) was formally established in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Algiers Peace Agreement . After a lengthy investigation and litigation process , the Commission rendered its decisions on 13 April 2002 at the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague , with the entire process guaranteed by the United Nations ( UN ) and the OAU/AU and witnessed by several international parties , including United States ( US ) and the European Union . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was charged with guaranteeing the EEBC ruling and enforcing implementation without preconditions . <p> The EEBC ruling presented both countries with gains and losses ; however , one of the EEBC 's most significant decisions saw the flashpoint of the 1998-2000 war , the rural border town of Badme , awarded to Eritrea . While Eritrea accepted the EEBC 's decisions in their entirety and generally sought to uphold the integrity of the Algiers Peace Agreement , and although Article 4.15 of the agreement clearly stipulates that both parties " agree that the delimitation and demarcation determinations of the Commission shall be final and binding , " the TPLF completely failed to abide by its international legal obligations and responsibilities . Instead , it persistently sought to obstruct or reverse the EEBC 's decisions , continued to militarily occupy large swathes of Eritrean territory ( including Badme ) , and sustained a policy of unremitting aggression and hostility toward Eritrea . <p> Shortly after the verdict , TPLF leadership actually appeared to accept the EEBC ruling ; both the Foreign Minister and the parliament made statements proclaiming their " satisfaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the TPLF also expressed gratitude to the Commission for delivering a " just " verdict , even calling on the international community to " compel Eritrea to agree to a speedy demarcation . " <p> However , this line of approach was quickly and dramatically reversed . In 2003 , TPLF officials denounced the ruling as " illegal , unjust and irresponsible , " while castigating the Boundary Commission and seeking to reopen the EEBC 's decisions through an " alternative mechanism . " Subsequently , in 2004 , the TPLF vacillated again , this time shifting its position to claim that it accepted the ruling " in principle , " but within the context of various and numerous reservations , qualifications , and preconditions prior to implementation . <p> Importantly , the TPLF also began to establish illegal settlements within sovereign Eritrean territories ( an international crime ) , and in 2006 the Foreign Minister , the TPLF 's Seyoum Mesfin , sent a highly-publicized letter to the President of the EEBC , Sir Elihu Lauterpacht , again criticizing the EEBC and even assigning blame to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international obligations under the agreement . <p> Beyond its outright military occupation of sovereign Eritrean territories and rejection and obstruction of the EEBC ruling , the TPLF also maintained a policy of unrelenting military aggression toward Eritrea . In early June 2016 , for instance , the TPLF directed a large , unprovoked attack against Eritrea on the Tsorona Central Front , leading to the death of hundreds of Ethiopians and 18 Eritreans . Notably , the region , located along the tense , militarized border , was the scene of some of the fiercest fighting during the TPLF 's 1998-2000 war of aggression . It is important to note that such aggression , described by the Nuremberg Tribunal as " the supreme international crime , " was not only a grave breach of fundamental international law and the UN Charter , but also a clear , direct violation of Article 1.1 of the Algiers Peace Agreement . Rather than an isolated incident , however , the mid-2016 attack was only one in a long series of deadly provocations by the TPLF after the end of the destructive 1998-2000 war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Eritrea on no less than 12 occasions . <p> The TPLF not only oversaw the occupation of sovereign Eritrean territory and engaged in frequent illegal incursions into and attacks against Eritrea , it also regularly made calls for the overthrow of the Eritrean government and , through belligerent , threatening statements , boldly proclaimed its intentions to carry out " military action to oust the regime in Eritrea , " -- again violating the UN Charter ( e.g. , Article 2.4 ) , international law , and the Algiers Peace Agreement . <p> Sadly , although the entire EEBC process was guaranteed by the UN , UNSC , and OAU/AU , and witnessed by several international parties , the international community effectively ignored the TPLF 's complete failure to abide by its international legal obligations and responsibilities for demarcating the border . Instead of condemning the group 's illegal military occupation and repeated aggressive actions or calling for the immediate , unconditional implementation of the EEBC ruling , the international community , principally led by the US , turned a blind eye , abdicated their responsibility , and remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Smothering a region 's hopes for peace <p> In April 2018 , Dr. Abiy Ahmed took office in Ethiopia . His appointment came on the back of years of widespread protests in Ethiopia against TPLF rule . Ethiopia is divided into ethnically-based states within a federal system that was ruled by a coalition of four parties -- the Ethiopian People 's Revolutionary Democratic Front ( EPRDF ) -- which was dominated by the Tigrayan minority , who make up approximately 6% of the country 's total population of 110 million . In 2015 , popular protests , spearheaded by the Oromo , the country 's largest ethnic group ( constituting about 35% of the population ) , and later the Amhara , the country 's second largest ethnic group ( 27% ) , about land seizures and evictions , unemployment , human rights abuses , widespread corruption , and economic and political marginalization quickly spread across the country and threatened to bring down the regime . Thousands of civilians were killed or arrested , there was large-scale displacement , and the TPLF put the country under an extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ethiopia was hailed as a " development darling " and one of the top performing African economies , regularly posting impressive economic growth figures ( albeit ones that were clouded by widespread skepticism about the validity of reported figures ) , the country was also plagued by high levels of poverty and inequality , heavy foreign debt , rising inflation , a rapidly growing trade deficit , and a critical shortage of foreign currency , all of which put the economy in a perilous state . ( Recent empirical research has compellingly shown that much of the socioeconomic growth claimed under the TPLF 's rule was a mirage and based on cooked data . ) <p> It was against this backdrop of turmoil , mounting discontent , and widespread unrest , with the TPLF regime beginning to crumble , that Hailemariam Desalegn , who succeeded Meles Zenawi as prime minister , resigned in February 2018 . Dr. Abiy Ahmed , then a relative unknown , was soon appointed to the post . With the pressing need for fundamental changes and dramatic reforms abundantly clear -- even Desalegn acknowledged as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work quickly . He loosened the state 's tight grip and control on the economy , privatizing key state-owned enterprises , pledged multi-party elections , publicly denounced the TPLF 's use of torture and apologized for the killing of protestors , released thousands of prisoners and opposition leaders , and promoted reconciliation with exiled dissidents and critics . <p> The PM 's wide-ranging reforms also extended to dramatically shifting the country 's longstanding policy toward Eritrea , with Abiy announcing that Ethiopia would finally unconditionally accept and fully implement the UN-backed EEBC ruling of 2002 . <p> Abiy was by no means perfect and his government made many mistakes . A lot of his reforms stalled , security forces were heavy-handed , and the government often fell back into a number of troubling old habits . At the same time , however , many developments were greeted positively by the people of Ethiopia ( and the region ) and much lauded by the international community . <p> In stark contrast to the general sense of optimism and change , the TPLF , brooding and intransigent , began doggedly working to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the region . The group , which had maintained power for nearly 30 years through absolute force backed by the unconditional support of a small , yet extremely powerful and influential , group of Western states , sought to block the positive developments and stymie any efforts at reform or genuine change . <p> Deeply bitter and resentful about its loss of power and control over looted state resources , the TPLF retreated from Addis Ababa to its base in Tigray Region . From there , it worked relentlessly to promote conflict , tension , and chaos , including supporting subversive groups , inciting ethnic violence , and sponsoring assassinations , all in the hopes that the resultant instability and insecurity would prevent and roll back the reforms underway and ultimately topple the Ethiopian government . This would , according to the group 's calculus , allow it to evade accountability or justice for its decades of crimes and even help it restore its former dominance , both in Ethiopia and across the wider region . <p> Almost immediately after its precipitous fall , the TPLF began actively preparing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge caches in civilian areas ) , and training over 250,000 militias and special forces ( by embezzling and diverting development funds ) . As well , it refused to vacate occupied Eritrean territories and directed groups to physically obstruct Ethiopia 's troops as they sought to move away from the border . The TPLF also rejected any and all proposals to establish and institutionalize cross-border socioeconomic and peaceful processes with Eritrea . Instead , it amassed troops and moved heavy weaponry toward sensitive areas alongside the border , dug and fortified trenches , and even attempted to slip armed criminals , intelligence agents , and sleeper cells into Eritrea . <p> Alongside all of this , the TPLF was stoking tensions and dangerously ratcheting up violent , extremist , and hateful speech . While the people of Ethiopia and Eritrea were looking forward to consolidating peace , the TPLF completely dismissed -- and even derisively mocked -- all peaceful overtures or offers for constructive dialogue , including mediation efforts from officials , respected elders , and community leaders . On an almost daily basis , high-level TPLF officials conducted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prowess and capabilities , while parades and displays of troops and military hardware were frequent . <p> Keeping with established precedent <p> On 3/4 November 2020 , the TPLF launched a surprise , unprovoked attack across all outposts of Ethiopia 's Northern Command . According to different estimates , between 3,000 and 6,000 federal troops were callously slaughtered in the attack ( many as they were sleeping and defenseless ) . Thousands more were maimed and forced to desperately flee . <p> The premeditated act of unprecedented scale and gravity was fully endorsed by the TPLF Central Committee in its meeting in the preceding days . The TPLF 's objectives -- which its officials and high-level cadres openly boasted of on several occasions -- were to take control of the Northern Command ( which possessed some 80% of Ethiopia 's entire weaponry ) and then march to Addis Ababa in order to topple the federal government . The plan also involved the goal of invading Eritrea to carry out " regime change " and to incorporate large swathes of sovereign Eritrean territory into Tigray Region . ( If things did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to resort to destroying the nation outright . ) <p> Ethiopia 's Northern Command was the largest of the country 's four territorial military contingents and one-third of its personnel were ethnic Tigrayans with political affiliation and loyalty to the TPLF . The " command and control " hierarchy was also disproportionately dominated by loyalist officers . Relying on these , and with almost a quarter of a million militia and special forces of its own , the TPLF was thus highly confident that its operation -- which its officials dubbed a " pre-emptive blitzkrieg or lightning strike " -- would succeed in a matter of days . Completely contrary to all of its plans and expectations , the TPLF failed . <p> Yet in keeping with its longstanding precedent , established over several decades , the TPLF has spent the two years since it sparked the war repeatedly rebuffing offers for peace and breaking ceasefires . Contemptuously , it dismissed goodwill gestures toward peace from the Ethiopian government as " a sick joke " and a " PR gimmick " . All the while , it used these periods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , establish military bases and arms caches within civilian areas , and then launch attacks against neighboring regions , such as Amhara and Afar , and Eritrea . <p> Even now , as TPLF leaders arrive in South Africa under the supposed banner of peace , one should not be quick to assume that the group , which crows regularly about war being its " traditional sport " , has suddenly turned over a new leaf . Rather , the move must be viewed within the context of the utter failure of its latest round of attacks ( launched in late August and breaching a ceasefire that had been in effect since March 2022 ) and Ethiopian federal forces rapidly closing . Instead of being driven by a genuine search for peace , it could be that the TPLF move is borne out of sheer desperation and the group is seeking to secure exile , buy more time , or pursue its war on Ethiopia , Eritrea , and the region through other avenues . <p> The opposite of truth <p> As this broad sweep of regional history clearly demonstrates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " committed to peace " are laughable and can only be regarded as the opposite of truth . The reality is that the TPLF has been an obstacle to peace and the central cause of so much of the tension , violence , and instability that have plagued the entire region . In addition to disintegrating under scrutiny , however , the widespread claims and portrayals about the TPLF being " committed to peace " are a sharp , bitter insult to the many , many people in Ethiopia , Eritrea , and across the rest of the Horn of Africa who have been victimized by the group in recent years and over the past three decades . <p> Now , as the region and international community look forward hopefully to the possibility of peace , it is important that the history and continued actions of those who have obdurately blocked it are not obscured . <p> Dr. Fikrejesus Amahazion is a researcher and analyst based in East Africa . <h> Join Scoop Citizen <p> Scoop is a champion of independent journalism and open publishing - informing New Zealanders through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range of sectors .

But if they wish to get a HIV test then they need their parent or legal guardian 's consent in India . " Lot of young people do not want to go for a HIV test because they do not want to be judged by their parents or legal guardians . Also , there are prejudices related to being sexually active as well . " <p> There are punitive laws . For instance , those young people who inject drugs may be reluctant to access harm reduction related health services . <p> We need legal and policy harmonization so that everyone including the young can access the full spectrum of HIV services everywhere , especially those who are at a greater risk . <p> Privacy and confidentiality <p> Legal requirement to show government identity cards for accessing range of HIV-related services may deter some young key populations from accessing care . Applesta also points out that most of the HIV services are available during the time when young people may be in school or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be available at the time convenient or preferable for those most in need . <p> Stigma and discrimination still blocks access to care <p> HIV-related stigma continues to be a barrier in accessing healthcare services .

" If a healthcare centre is not youth-friendly and not a safe space for the young key populations , then we will not be able to serve most in need as they may be reluctant to opt-in for services , " said Applesta . <p> Self-stigma or shame is another obstacle which impacts self-acceptance , self-perception , self-efficacy , self-esteem and self-confidence . Self-stigma often results when self-issues interact with external causes ( such as discrimination or violence in family , school , social or work settings ) , resulting in depression , low self-esteem , anger and self-harm , even suicidal intent . <p> Self-stigma contributes to ' bridging behaviours ' -- such as injecting drug use -- that can increase a young person 's sexual risk-taking .

She stressed upon strengthening HIV prevention services with full range of HIV prevention tools and approaches available and accessible to the young key populations . Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis ( PrEP ) is yet to be made available widely in India . Post-Exposure Prophylaxis also needs to be made more widely accessible . <p> Comprehensive sexuality education is another missing or weak cog-in-the-wheel in India 's education system .

@@94376236 <p> Geneva - Sudanese authorities must take serious measures to protect civilians , control tribal violence in the country , and ensure that the rule of law is implemented after hundreds of people were killed and injured in the most recent rounds of violence in the Blue Nile state , Euro-Med Monitor said in a statement . <p> Euro-Med Monitor has followed with great regret the death of 223 people , the injury of dozens more , and the displacement of thousands as a result of tribal violence in the Blue Nile state in southeast Sudan , near the Ethiopian border . <p> After weeks of relative calm , the region experienced a resurgence of violent clashes in September which resulted in the deaths of seven people and the injury of many more . The events began to unfold on Monday ( 17 October ) and escalated into full-blown clashes on Wednesday ( 19 October ) in the Wad al Mahi area of Ad-Damazin , amid a near-total lack of security services . <p> Given the bloodshed , the governor of Blue Nile state on Friday declared a 30-day state of emergency , granting security forces full authority to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local police , army , and intelligence officials , as well as the Rapid Support Forces , to intervene with all available means to put an end to the tribal fighting . <p> The grim progression of recent events is evidence of a pattern . Repeated rounds of violence and the periodic deaths of large numbers of people are a natural consequence of insufficient security measures , and of government authorities ' failure to control matters by imposing the rule of law , taking prompt action , and finding radical solutions to ongoing disputes . Moreover , part of the conflict stems from systematic discrimination and racism , as one of the tribes involved is barred from owning land in the Blue Nile . <p> Tribal violence in Sudan is a recurring problem that needs a radical solution , not temporary measures . Such violence is difficult to prevent and control without addressing its root causes and creating a state of consensus , whereby all parties commit to resolve problems through specific , peaceful , and non-violent mechanisms . <p> According to UN estimates , the most recent rounds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hundreds more were injured , and approximately 65,000 people were displaced . Last April , 159 people were killed and thousands displaced from their homes in Kreinik , a city in Sudan 's West Darfur region . <p> Euro-Med Monitor stresses the need for comprehensive solutions to tribal violence in Sudan , including effective mechanisms to implement a national action plan to protect civilians , ensure the rule of law , and see to it that tribal disputes are not factors that affect the country 's political process . <p> The absence of civil rule since the Sudanese army seized power in October 2021 has exacerbated existing political and economic problems and paved the way for tribal conflicts and disputes in the country . The Sudanese army should return to the democratic path -- one that supports fair and equitable representation for all segments of society . <p> Sudanese authorities must conduct an urgent , independent investigation into the violence in the Blue Nile state , hold all those involved accountable , and ensure justice is served to the victims and their families . <p> Euro-Med Monitor calls on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protect civilians and their interests by maintaining security , responding quickly and effectively to outbreaks of tribal violence , and investigating the absence of or delay in security interventions to impose the rule of law during clashes in the Blue Nile state . <h> Join Scoop Citizen <p> Scoop is a champion of independent journalism and open publishing - informing New Zealanders through straight-talking independent journalism , and publishing news from a wide range of sectors .

Girard 's ideas are equally compelling . Perhaps we 're attracted to images of violence because of its anthropological function in the earliest periods of community formation .

A few years earlier , King 's novel about a pyrokinetic child being hunted by a government who want to weaponise her would have seemed thrilling , maybe even insightful . <h> Advertisement <h> Literary snobs and good writers <p> Perhaps the only thing worse than the literary snob who looks down on everyone who does n't read Joyce 's Ulysses on loop is the literary snob of the populist variety , the one who scowls at everyone who does n't read the kind of fiction that ordinary folks like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described the 2003 awarding of the National Book Foundation 's Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters to Stephen King as " another low in the shocking process of dumbing down our cultural life , " it was easy to dislike Bloom as an example of the former . Listening to King discuss his writing , it is almost as easy to dismiss him as the latter . <p> What makes a good writer ? According to King , " If you wrote something for which someone sent you a check , if you cashed the check and it did n't bounce , and if you then paid the light bill with the money , I consider you talented . " <p> So is King , as Bloom writes , " an immensely inadequate writer on a sentence-by-sentence , paragraph-by-paragraph , book-by-book basis " ? King does , after all , describe his own work as " the literary equivalent of a Big Mac and a large fries from McDonald 's " . And there are numerous passages throughout his work -- probably most pronouncedly in the words of writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious disdain for academic knowledge and scholarship . <p> As Bloom would probably argue , consistency in style and tone , and complexity of form , are key elements underpinning any kind of aesthetic mastery . And it 's undeniable that King has produced a not-inconsiderable volume of poorly written and inconsistent work . Sometimes his novels warrant criticisms of pretentiousness , hackneyed style and tediously repetitive prose . <h> Advertisement <p> King may or may not be a great , or even good , writer . His more self-consciously serious stuff sometimes seems intolerable to me : kitsch is only fun if the attitude is fun . And some of his work ( Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption and Dolores Claiborne , for example ) feels heavy-handed to the point of being virtually unreadable . Never mind -- these works are frequently adapted into incredibly popular and incredibly dull films . <p> In any case , the debate continues to play out , with critics intermittently arguing for and against King 's writing . Dwight Allen , for example , wrote in the Los Angeles Review of Books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the same publication , Sarah Langan responded : " All of King 's novels , even the stinkers , have resonance . ... his fiction is n't just reflective of the current culture , it casts judgement . ... No one except King challenges Americans so relentlessly , to be brave . To kill our monsters . " <p> King is , undeniably , a juggernaut of commercial literary production -- an industry unto himself , a literary and cinematic brand -- who has written a handful of genuine horror genre masterpieces throughout his career . <p> Perhaps it 's in part this combination of prolific volume and intermittent brilliance that keeps me , like an addict , coming back for more . <p> Ultimately , though , I would suggest I like reading King for the same reason so many others do , a reason that accounts for his enduring popularity when better horror stylists ( King 's contemporaries Clive Barker and Peter Straub , for example ) have fallen by the wayside . And that 's his unprecedented capacity to tap into nostalgia . <h> Advertisement <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on Stephen King , in one of those random nostalgic moments that seem to populate his fictional world , my brother gave me Revival for Christmas . <p> King 's Frankensteinian novel , published in 2014 , is about the aftermath of an encounter between a young boy and a Methodist minister fascinated by electricity . After years of mainly reading what is sometimes pretentiously called " literary " fiction , and mostly avoiding anything written after the 19th or very early 20th centuries , I returned to King-world . <p> And I was dazzled by what I found there , realising what I must have known as a kid : King is a superb storyteller . Much of his work is characterised by an infectiously energetic prose style , governed by a flair for simple but satisfying plotting and a supremely inventive imagination . <p> And -- yep -- I was stunned by his capacity to precisely render in prose , perhaps more acutely than any other contemporary writer , the confusing , often hokey and melodramatic , but always exciting images , emotions , and sensibilities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and totally inimitable , about King . Despite his work 's sometimes kitsch silliness ( a hazard of the horror genre ) , despite the not uncommon misfires -- and despite the absurdly voluminous output - King is able to authentically generate an atmosphere of nostalgia that taps into something at the very core of the pleasure of reading . <p> Swedish actor Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise the Clown in a scene from It . Photo / Supplied <h> It : a masterpiece of nostalgia <p> His novel It is a case in point : a masterclass in narrative development through a nostalgic structure . <h> Advertisement <p> It -- for anyone who has n't read it , or seen one of the three film adaptations -- cuts between the adult lives and childhoods of a group of misfits , the " Losers Club " , who collectively band together to fight the evil of their town , Derry . That evil takes the form of a shape-shifting clown , Pennywise . <p> The Losers Club battled and banished Pennywise as kids , but now " it " has come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live up to their childhood promise : that if " it " ever returns , they , too , will return to fight " it " . The narrative cuts between characters , en route to Derry , as they recall forgotten passages from their childhood " it 's " return has forced them to remember . <p> So , the novel is structured around a nostalgic trope : adults literally remembering and reconstructing their childhood in the present . At the same time , the town Derry is developed by King according to a quintessentially nostalgic image of the American small town , recalling peak 1950s Americana . Think Grease : soda fountains , switchblades and quiffs . But behind closed doors , fathers abuse daughters , mothers keep their children sick , and a monster that assumes the form of whatever demon most terrifies you stalks the streets , killing and eating children . <p> The narrative architecture is starkly simple , sustaining a profound sense of dread in the reader . The characters remember a dreadful past , in a present-future they wish had never materialised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given its suggestion that one 's future is foreclosed , that all we have are memories of a better time : memories that only exist as memories . <p> In some of King 's work -- Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption , for example -- nostalgia acts mainly as window dressing , functioning primarily as an aesthetic . But in It , nostalgia is neither incidental nor benign : it 's a way of exploring the impossibility of having to remember trauma . <p> Memory appears inevitably nostalgic , because it involves , for the characters , narrative reconstruction of childhood in the present . In the Derry library , for town librarian Mike Hanlon -- the only Loser to remain in Derry as an adult ( and the only one who did n't battle It in the sewers as a child ) - for example . Or for Ben Hanscom , an internationally successful architect , once the fat kid of the group , who flies back to Derry , drunk and asleep in first-class . <h> Advertisement <p> In this way , the novel functions as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of clich ? s from the horror playbook become legitimately terrifying for the children in the novel - they 're kids after all , and the cultural worlds of kids are often constructed around clich ? s -- from mass-produced popular figures like the Wolf Man , to figures associated with the characters ' nightmarish personal traumas . <p> It 's a " coming of age " story with a vengeance - a metatext on the horrors of youth , of fitting in , metamorphosing into adulthood , and breaking free of one 's parents - and it inherently explores the ways we use horror stories ( like fairytales ) to come to terms with this . <p> As Adrian Daub , revisiting the novel on its 30-year anniversary , wrote in the Los Angeles Review of Books in 2016 : <p> " Anamnesis -- remembering -- is the central structuring device of It 's parallel plots : characters have to find out what they once did , and confront what on some level they already know . ... Perhaps all the kids who devoured It in the ' 80s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world -- that unique combination of vivid clarity and forgetfulness -- its formal principle . ... All the friends , events , images , and feelings that we ever-so-gently cover in sand as we stumble into adulthood can startle us when we come face to face with them again , and these are the true source of It 's terror . What else have we hidden back there , we wonder uneasily ? " <p> In It 's truly weird ( over ) length , in It 's oscillating moments of genius and stupidity , in It 's ambition -- as King 's horror book about horror , the horror book to end all horror books -- it is an American masterpiece . It captures everything incisive , deluded , cruel and sentimental about the popular American literary imagination . <h> Reading as escape and connection <h> Advertisement <p> I think it taps into something at the heart of the process of reading novels . We sit with a novel and retreat from the world : an intensely solipsistic act . A novel sweeps us up into a fantasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reality ) and makes us feel , in our solitude , excitement about what 's to come -- but also a faint melancholy in remembering we will soon have to leave this world . <p> It 's no surprise many people cry at the end of novels : we 've made such a personal investment , then that world simply disappears , and all we 're left with are our memories of it . In our desire to return to this pleasurable state , we may feel compelled to borrow -- or buy -- another book . <p> But while reading a novel feels like a private act ( as opposed to going to a movie or concert ) , there 's also always a sense we are connected to ( and connecting with ) some kind of cultural and historical continuum . <p> We read Dickens in our solitude , yet imagine we 're in Victorian England , connected across 150-odd years . Time and space seem collapsed into a vibrant , active present . Dickens speaks to us , but more significantly , the zeitgeist addresses us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after all ? <p> The structure of It ( and much of King 's other work ) reproduces what attracts many of us to reading fiction in the first place -- an escape into a present that is at the same time a kind of memory-fantasy , governed by lingering nostalgia . <p> For Marxist philosopher Ernst Bloch , literature offers a utopian space in which we can transcend and transform the past and future , captured in the figure of heimat ( meaning homeland -- and appropriated in opposition to the term 's German nationalist use ) . Literature allows us to return to a mythic-nostalgic image of " home " -- which we know has never actually existed . This nostalgic space opens the possibility of a better collective present and future . <h> Advertisement <h> Long live the King ! <p> There are definitely better , more controlled stylists than King in popular horror fiction . But their work is somehow more forgettable . King 's perpetual presence - as ringmaster , as media conglomerate , as relentless worker -- is always in performance in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or his narratives hokey , but you will always recognise them as Stephen King . He has a flavour , and it ties his work together , good and bad . Much of it emanates from the man himself and his sheer love of writing and reading -- dare I say it , of " literature " . <p> This is evident in his publishing history , but also in the forewords and reviews , and endorsements , he writes for writers he loves . The revival of interest in noir master Jim Thompson , for example , who had vanished into obscurity , seems to be at least in part down to King 's forewords to several of his books . And one wonders how much the Hard Case Crime imprint , which publishes hard-boiled crime novels in the flavour of those of the 1950s and 60s , relies on the success of King 's original crime novels written for them . How many forgotten masterpieces of noir literature have been brought back into print because King publishes with Hard Case ? How many books have moved because a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No other living horror writer has enjoyed King 's longevity . There 's no one whose monsters have lingered quite as long in the popular imagination , and in the imaginations of countless readers like me . <p> The literature we read as children and adolescents has a profound effect on our cultural and personal formation , shaping our becoming as adults . King 's worlds , where children struggle to shape their futures , draw upon our own , personal nostalgia . But they also tap into a kind of nostalgia that lies at the heart of novelistic pleasure itself . <p> Horror films and novels situate us in precarious situations - we identify with victims , sense their isolation as monsters attack , and feel their glory when and if the monsters are defeated . <h> Advertisement <p> We creep through the worlds of horror , watchful , alert , before returning to the safety of our bedrooms , but we 're always a little sad when we come back : that world may have been dominated by killer birds , or by hellish blood-sucking fiends , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- place .

He combines a touch of the moderation that also gives hope , while providing the science , that like most of the universe is inherently simple and yet immensely profound . <p> If there is such a force as sad humour , it will be epitomised by the line of " usual suspects " whose egos will not acknowledge that there are functional alternatives to " destroying humanity " in order to save the planet for the devolution of humanity . <p> It would be very doubtful that either Sparky no-name or Mr Hughes has any actual training or degree such as a Ph.D in climatology to impress us that they hold vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have read or obtained from the internet , and by the way they seem to rave on from totally unreliable sources . Dave Beard brought a very nice , fresh , honest and readable approach -- well done . Mr Sparky no-name suggests that new protein sources such as insects are on the horizon , but a search does not reveal any recipe for a cockroach and flies pot-au-feu so far -- perhaps he may like to suggest possible preparation . Myself , well , I think I will stay with a good old pork chop . Now both of the doomsday prophets are going to tell me that pigs fart more than sheep or cows . Sad but true . <p> Gosh Dennis you are funny ! All that meat must keep your neck strong to hold that head up ay . I 've been experimenting with lentils , mung beans and chick peas . There are some delicious recipes on the internet . Give them a go ! Nobody has to give up meat completely , but try 3 meat free meals a week and you 'll feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be contributing to the very problem of global warming . Mung beans with their soluble fibre and raffinose will cause excess wind -- not only getting up the nose of anyone around you but contributing to the problem the same as any other animal . Just a thought . <p> Being many years your senior Aimee , I researched diets of many descriptions . When I say researched , I do not just mean that I have ' tried them ' , but have actually researched them after certain health misadventures , when I found that some hospital specialists and dieticians were woefully short on actual knowledge -- once taken past the surface ' mantras ' into deeper and finer aspects of their own specialisation . As arrogant as that may sound , I can produce results of my studies and application if you doubt my knowledge in that area , but I will not bore you with it here . Generally speaking , a varied diet which provides an abundance of protein , vitamins -- vitamin E being one of the better anti-aging vitamins -- and a good cross-section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safely taken in supplement form and is very beneficial in the recovery from ' men 's complaints ' and surgical indignities . Yes , there is a place for mung beans , chick-peas , lentils and other legumes such as green beans , and greens in general . Soy beans are great because of the ' plant estrogen ' they produce , and are particularly good for the ladies as they are passing through ' middle age ' . However , balance is the key and plenty of meat and fats containing amino-acids is the key to brain development once infants leave the breast . So Aimee , continue to enjoy your meat dishes -- yo'all hear now !

@@94598231 <h> Now you 're cooking <p> Add interest and depth to a white kitchen by incorporating subtle texture . <p> Kitchens sell houses but they can also break the bank ! In Live Luxe , The Block presenter and interior designer Shelley Ferguson suggests considering the following points before starting the design for your dream kitchen . <h> Lock in your look <p> Create a design board for your kitchen -- or , if you 've created a board for your overall home , use that as inspiration for your kitchen . Choosing an overall theme gives you direction , so check out magazines , Pinterest and Instagram to identify your favourite designs and use the architecture of your home as inspiration . <h> Kitchen layouts <p> To choose the right layout for you , look at your lifestyle . How many people live in your home and how do they use the kitchen ? Also consider the space . What kitchen layouts would work there ? Are you prepared to take out walls and renovate to get the kitchen solution you want , or do you need to work within the current floor plan ? <h> Social distancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cooktop and fridge . About 1200mm between each area is ideal , and if possible no major traffic should cross through the working triangle . The sink should be in the centre of the working triangle as it 's the most frequently used . And no full-height cabinetry or appliance should be positioned between any two of the major work centres -- keep them to the sides . Whatever layout you choose , mark the triangle out to make sure it 's not too big or too small . <p> The kitchen island can create a focal point for the entire living space . <h> Orientation station <p> Look at where the natural light and outlook is in your kitchen and orient the layout to suit . There 's usually a service zone including a large wall of cabinetry , cooktop and ovens -- place this in the least desirable spot in the kitchen . Save the lighter , nicer spots for the prep and entertainment zones where you will spend more time and rather than hiding the sink away , position it facing the view you like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each appliance to the other and make sure there 's enough access to them and space around them . You do n't want an oven and dishwasher colliding upon opening , or no prep and ventilation space around your cooktop . <h> Big beginnings <p> The largest areas in the space -- benchtops , cabinetry , paint and splashback -- will have the most impact , so choose these first . Get physical samples and create a palette you can keep adding to . You want them all to be complementary , so consider if the undertones and colours work together . Do n't be scared to make a statement ! <p> Drawers fit more than regular cupboards . <h> Cabinet meeting <p> Cabinets can be finished in almost any colour and texture to be cohesive with your overall design , so choose a profile that suits your theme . Wainscoted suits a farmhouse chic look , straight panels look great in coastal homes , and simple fronts are ultra-modern . You can keep drawer styles clean and simple and use the finish and the hardware to ramp up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement . <h> Refine the eyeline <p> Standard cabinetry is 600mm deep . But if your dishwasher and fridge are deeper , you 'll end up with appliances jutting out and ruining your streamlined design . In this case , pack your cabinetry out so everything lines up perfectly . <h> Open shelving <p> Kitchens need to be so hardworking that they can often end up looking utilitarian . Using open shelving to display ceramics , plants or cookbooks creates a design moment , adds different textures , and breaks up large areas of cabinetry . Only bother if you 're up for the styling challenge , though -- otherwise you may end up with clutter and dust being the main feature . <h> Light it right <p> Use layers of lighting to make sure there 's sufficient light for all kitchen tasks . A combination of downlights , pendants and under-cabinet strip LEDs works well . <h> The pointy end <p> Not having enough power points in the kitchen can be a big frustration . Mark them out on a sketch or plan of your kitchen , taking into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them double power points where possible , and try to sneak in a few hidden ones -- using a shelf in the pantry as an appliance cupboard can be a great bench-space saver . <p> Shelley Ferguson . <h> The ultimate island <p> Islands are a brilliant kitchen design feature because you can make them a work of art that creates a focal point for the entire living space . Here are some of my favourite things to do with a kitchen island : <p> -- Clad it in stone <p> -- Curve it ! <p> -- Add fluted timber panels <p> -- Give it legs ! <p> -- Show some metal <p> -- Add " waterfall " ends , so the stone is featured on the top and sides . <h> Be complementary <p> Look at your interior colour palette for clues on what benchtop to select . Gather samples of flooring , carpet , curtains , paint and tiles , and take them with you when looking at benchtop samples to see at a glance what ties in . Rather than looking at samples on a screen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for what you like , and there 's expert help on hand . Take stone samples home and view them in different lights and times of day in your kitchen . <h> Price it right <p> The benchtop is often the hero of your entire kitchen , so it needs to have wow factor . However , for most of us , budget defines our choices . The great news is there are lots of statement benchtop materials available in every price range , from cost-effective laminate to mid-range engineered stone and high-end natural stone . Figure out a realistic budget before getting your heart set on a material . Remember , additional to the stone you will also need to pay the fabricator ( the company who cut and install the stone ) . The following list shows some popular materials in order of their relative cost . <p> $$$$ Quartzite <p> $$$ Marble <p> $$$ Granite <p> $$ Stainless steel <p> $$ Engineered stone <p> $ Laminate <p> $ Timber <h> Remember that size matters <p> If you have a long kitchen , opt for a large slab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( a key detail when you have a defined pattern ) . Stone and engineered stone slabs come in different sizes , including jumbo ( 3.2m x 1.8m ) , so it pays to compare the benchtop size you 've planned to the size of the slab you want . <p> Kitchen benchtops need to withstand all manner of food and drink spillages . <h> Ensure durability <p> Choose benchtop materials that are durable and easy to clean with minimal join or grout lines to create a smooth and easy-to-clean surface . <h> Use the whole slab <p> If you are using natural stone , it comes in slabs and there are often offcuts . Ask the fabricator if they can cut the stone in the most efficient way to allow for offcuts . These can be used as bar benchtops , tabletops or even open shelving . <h> Save with standard <p> Stone comes in standard thicknesses , the most common being 20mm . Any wider and pieces need to be cut separately and mitred together to create a block of stone . So , if you 're on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard-width stone . <h> Tips <p> Drawers fit more stuff ! Use them for all your below-bench-height storage , including dinnerware and serveware . Adding smaller inner drawers within the main drawer gives you a slimline solution for cutlery without affecting the outward look of the cabinetry . <p> Taking cupboards right to the ceiling not only makes a space feel larger and more seamless , but also gives you more storage space . If you have a very high stud , pack out the space between the top of the cabinetry and the ceiling with a bulkhead -- this is a boxed-out wall to join the two spaces . <p> If everything in your kitchen is a solid white , the effect can be cold and flat . Add interest and depth by incorporating subtle texture . While cabinetry may be white , adding a veined marble-look stone , brass tapware , fluted glass upper cabinets or Lucite handles creates dimension , reflects light and demands attention . <p> Invest in quality hinges and other hardware if you can . While they 're not seen , a drooping cupboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid noise and hurt fingers , and the strength of the hinges keeps the cabinetry you 've invested in streamlined . <p> If you ca n't fit in an island , a mini-island or butcher 's block is a great way to add storage while saving space . <p> You can mix metals ! My rule is to mix what I call " dirty " metals , such as brass , bronze or gunmetal , but to avoid mixing shiny metals such as brushed brass and chrome . And I do n't mix dirty and shiny together . <p> The drain and basket waste surrounds will come with a standard stainless finish on your sink order , but it is possible to get them in various metal finishes to match your tapware , so shop around . <p> Place your bins close to your main prep area , away from fresh food storage and close to an exit for disposal . 
@@94598232 <h> Plant green for a better feeling <p> Space , time , physical work and the colour green ... It 's no wonder that gardening feeds both body and soul , writes James Wong . <p> Over the years , many theories have popped up to attempt to explain why spending time in green space can reduce feelings of stress and anxiety , improve self-image and , in some studies , even measurably reduce the need for pain medication . From their purported ability to clean the air , to allegedly mood-lifting compounds emitted by soil bacteria , to some mysterious effect that simply seeing the colour green has on our brains , let 's look at how the evidence stacks up . <p> Probably the most common claim I see is that plants , particularly houseplants , clean the air . While they do indeed do this on a planetary scale , the latest research now suggests that in indoor spaces the sheer volume you would need to achieve this makes it implausible . Quite how many ? Well , several hundred per square metre of living space to achieve the same benefit of simply opening a window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another one of the most enduring memes on social media is that soil bacteria , inhaled into our bloodstream , has been proven to improve our mood . Intrigued , I went to track down the scientific paper . This was a single study where the bacteria were injected directly into the brains of live lab mice . Unless you 're a caged mouse , this experiment does n't really confirm very much and even then the method of administration does n't sound like much fun . <p> What we do know , however , is there is something unusual about the colour green that seems to affect how our brains function . Researchers investigating the effect of exercise on mental health have found that seeing views of the natural world projected on to screens had additional benefits over and above the workout alone . However , when they manipulated the colour of these screens to show the same views in black and white or in shades of red , the effect was markedly reduced compared to the original green . <p> This may mean that using evergreen species or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fence green might contribute to its effect . <p> Similarly , designing your garden to be higher maintenance so that it is not simply somewhere to sunbathe in summer may improve the beneficial effect by encouraging gentle workouts . We know that low-impact , prolonged exercise , such as gardening , can burn more calories than a hard-hitting gym session , despite feeling easier . It is a way of being active that may appeal to far more people -- if for no other reason than it 's being outside in the fresh air and is n't as brain-numbingly boring as looking at the flashing lights of the treadmill , which brings me to my final point ... <p> Gardening is also a classic form of practising mindfulness , which can help to focus our thoughts on the here and now , distracting us from any worries or stresses . It 's not my thing , but mindfulness exercises are well documented to have a positive impact on mental health , and are even recommended by health professionals . So ditch dull , low-maintenance schemes such as herbaceous plants for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you could turn your garden into a welcoming , therapeutic space .

@@94622234 <p> Microsoft Build of OpenJDK , the vendor 's open source distribution of Java , has added an experimental feature to improve escape analysis compiler optimisation results . <p> With a patch and security update issued October 24 and dubbed the October 2022 PSU release , Microsoft seeks to improve escape analysis results by increasing the number of opportunities for scalar replacement . <p> In compiler optimisation , escape analysis is an algorithm that determines the dynamic scope of pointers , or where in the program a pointer can be accessed . <p> With scalar replacement , the Java just-in-time compiler can allocate the members , or scalars , of an object on the stack or in registers , rather than allocating the full object on the heap .

@@94622235 <h> Expedia CTO details return-to-work program for workers who come back <p> Expedia Group recently graduated its first group of former employees from a 16-week internship program aimed at reacquainting them to the technology workforce after having been away for two or more years . Anyone who took two or more years off to care for a family member is eligible . <p> Spurred by the global pandemic , the Great Resignation saw an exodus of people from the workforce ; over the past year , with millions of employees each month leaving jobs for a myriad of reasons . <p> Some employees said they were highly dissatisfied with work , but others cited more practical reasons . For example , women left the workforce more than men because of care-giving responsibilities , whether it was for children or elderly relatives , according to Amy Loomis , research director for IDC 's worldwide Future of Work market research service . <p> Although women are slightly more likely this year than last to say that their employer offers flexible work policies , the number is still low : just one-third say their company has flexible work , according to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the pandemic , only 22 per cent cited corporate flexibility around where and when they work . <p> With that backdrop , many organisations have responded to workplace churn and a dearth of tech talent by upskilling or reskilling existing workers and removing college degree requirements on job postings . Others are hiring through non-traditional approaches that include graduates of coding bootcamps , low-code training , and from population areas outside the norm . <p> Earlier this year , Expedia Group launched a return-to-work project called the Return Ticket Returnship Program , which can be attended by any worker with a caregiving gap on their resume greater than two years . The prospects do n't have to be former Expedia Group employees -- anyone with at least five years of tech career experience who left the workforce to care for someone can take part . <p> Expedia Group , which owns travel booking platforms Expedia.com , Hotels.com and Vrbo , pairs prospects with managers in an internship-style environment . The program is meant to sharpen worker skills , help them update resumes with new experiences , make networking connections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the aim of converting them to a full-time position . <p> Expedia Group 's goal is to have 50-50 gender balance by the end of 2025 at all levels . ( Currently , women represent 47 per cent of the company 's workforce . ) The first group of interns in the Return Ticket program -- seven women -- graduated in April ; the second group , which started in August , has 11 women and will run through the end of January . <p> Forty-five per cent of those involved in the Return Ticket program have already converted to full-time employees at Expedia Group " because of their strong performance in the program . " <p> Rathi Murthy , CTO of Expedia Group , is herself a mother and helped to shepherd the Return Ticket program . She responded to Computerworld questions about the organisation 's efforts to return workers to the workplace . The following are her responses : <p> What prompted the creation of the Return Ticket program ? <p> " We 're always looking for ways to build our tech talent pipeline , while also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caregiver has to pause their career to take care of a child or an elderly parent , they can have a very tough time getting back into the workforce , because either their technical skills have lapsed , or they 've lost their network connections . <p> " As a mother myself , there were definitely points in my career where I had to prioritise my family , but I was very lucky with always having amazing mentors who guided and supported me . At Expedia Group , we want to provide caregivers not just with the opportunity to pick up their careers , but with the support , mentorship and experience to truly excel . " <p> " Listening to our employees is important to retaining the great talent we have at Expedia Group , which is why feedback has always been a core part of our culture . When we hear their desire for more training or career development opportunities , it 's on us to make sure we act on it . <p> " We used feedback from our workforce to become more transparent about career advancement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to career development , including a tool that provides personalised recommendations for reaching individuals career goals . <p> " We also look for opportunities to up-skill and re-skill our people . Our recent investment in Udemy gives employees access to a self-paced online learning library to learn new IT skills on a schedule that works for them . <p> " Also , our learning team is currently reassessing teams ' skill needs with marketplace research and employee listening sessions . These insights show us the skills that are important today and in the future , so we can make sure our employees are set up for long-term success . " <p> " When employees see that we 've acted on their feedback , it shows that we 're invested in them and their growth . Our new career development tool launched less than a month ago has already been used by more than 50 per cent of our employees . This kind of engagement shows just how hungry they are for learning opportunities . When we set up our employees for success , it helps them to fulfill their potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win-win . " <p> In terms of IT , in what ways is ' empowerment ' important so IT staffers have a voice at the C-level table ? <p> " I invest a large amount of energy into developing relationships and empowering everyone on the product and technology team . It 's important that they 're highly motivated team players , who move quickly in a choreographed way to win . <p> " I 'm also a huge proponent of reverse mentoring . I have learned a lot from new graduates coming in with fresh ideas and new ways of solving old challenges . In this field , it 's important to open your mind to new ways of working and learning from everyone -- no matter their age . " <p> Do you see a problem with IT not having enough of a voice now ? <p> " Today 's CTOs and CIOs have a much broader remit and are more tuned in to business objectives than ever before . These days , technology is the backbone of every company , which means that tech and IT strategies need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can change rapidly , and too often IT projects are paused or changed before they can deliver value , so there needs to be a firm commitment from all parties to stay the course . <p> " It 's also important to have defined business metrics and demonstrate clearly how technology is moving the needle for the company . The team responsible for delivery should also be set up in the right way -- they will be accountable for delivering business outcomes , so durability is essential . " <p> What is more important on a candidate 's resume -- their degrees or skills ? Has that balance shifted recently ? <p> " When we hire , we 're looking for the most qualified candidate . A candidate 's skillset , experience , willingness to learn , and enthusiasm for our mission and values are always part of our evaluation . As we build our presence as a technology company powering travel , we need an experienced team with a diverse set of skills who can work through challenges and who want to continue to grow and learn throughout their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equitable employment opportunities in tech . We have an apprenticeship program , which is an 18-month rotational program for people who do not have a degree . Their skills and experience get them in the door , and we provide on-the-job learning opportunities and prepare them for a role in our tech organisation . <p> " Hiring is key to representation , and we continue to focus on hiring talent that represents the diverse travelers we serve . " <p> You 've used the term ' mindful tech leadership ' in describing your approach to a healthy workforce . What is that and why is it important ? <p> " In my personal time , I practice yoga and meditation which teaches the importance of mindfulness . My experience with digitally transforming tech companies has convinced me that there is a better path forward for a more mindful approach to tech leadership that empowers teams . <p> " Fostering data-driven cultures where leaders are empowered to continuously reprioritise workstreams means that teams can focus on solving problems that create the most value for the business . I spend a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're all pulling in the same direction . This helps us be more agile and ship solutions faster while sharing wins .

@@94622236 <p> When someone says they want to modernise an application for the cloud , what exactly do they mean ? Users have one perspective : They hope modernisation brings improved experiences , higher reliability , faster performance , and , ideally , more frequent feature deployments . <p> Architects , software developers , and devops engineers have different answers as to what app modernisation means . That 's because there are several technical approaches to app modernisation , and the optimal choice is n't always obvious . <p> For example , a workflow app used by dozens of users written in the latest versions of Java and MySQL may be an easy lift and shift to a public cloud . This approach requires little code rewriting but likely requires configuration changes , updating the CI/CD , and rerunning test automations . <p> On the other hand , if that same application is written in Cobol and runs on a mainframe , there 's a good chance it will need an overhaul before running in the cloud . <p> There are still several technical options in between lift and shift and a complete overhaul ; these are known as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences from one source to another , but they represent the top-level modernisation options well . <p> Factors to consider <p> Organisations have hundreds to thousands of legacy applications , apps with significant technical debt , and others with user or business benefits in a migration . Architects and technical leads often use different modernisation approaches depending on the business need and technical challenges . <p> The first issues to consider are the impacts on business operations and users . Mission-critical , higher-usage apps will require different technical approaches than apps used episodically . Every modernisation will require communication with users , testing , and training people on workflow changes . <p> Nitha Puthran , senior vice president of cloud and infrastructure at Persistent Systems , provides an overview of some of the business factors in selecting app modernisation approaches and road maps . <p> She says , " One of the biggest challenges organisations face is identifying and knowing which applications should be lifted and shifted , refactored , or rewritten and in what order . App modernisations require careful balancing speed to market with scalability , cost optimisation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " There can be many benefits to a cloud migration , including reducing costs , improving security and resilience , and making it easier to scale service delivery for customers , " he says . " For devops teams , it can improve staff agility and productivity , enabling teams to focus on the customer experience . " <p> Devops teams and architects should review each app 's business , technical , operational , and security factors and then consider these approaches to app cloud modernisation . <p> Retire apps that are no longer valuable <p> Still have apps to support dial-up connections , faxes , or other legacy ways of doing business ? When apps perform functions that are no longer needed , the appropriate modernisation strategy is to retire them . <p> Sometimes the decision to retire an app is clear cut : Business users have signed off on shutting it down , or retiring the app has no impact on business operations . But even when apps have low usage or perform a business function , their business value should be weighed against the modernisation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be appropriate when proprietary solutions are no longer necessary . He says , " Replacing an app is when an organisation stops relying on its own custom-built applications and migrates towards prebuilt third-party applications provided by a vendor and hosted on a cloud . " <p> Examples include customer relationship management tools , content management systems , or customised workflow tools developed when the equivalent SaaS , commercial , or open source solutions at the time did n't meet business needs . Today , business users may find better and cheaper third-party options compared to their proprietary one that needs updating . <p> Relocate the app to the cloud <p> Apps meeting business needs and running on supportable software stacks may be candidates for relocation . Instead of running them on dedicated hardware or virtual machines , the architecture and devops team find technical and business benefits by moving them to cloud environments . <p> For example , it may be easier to configure dev and test environments , autoscale production , and configure disaster recovery environments with the app running in a public or private cloud . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Migration does not equal modernisation . " He explains , " There are devops benefits to be gained with the lift-and-shift migration method . Almost all companies achieve some short-term gains , but the mistake that many tech leaders make is believing that the work stops there . " <p> Relocation may provide infrastructure flexibility , improved security , and cost reduction , but it does n't address issues with supporting the app and underlying code . <p> " Here 's the reality : A monolith in the cloud has all the same thorny issues it had on-premises -- slow engineering velocity , lack of scalability , and difficult maintainability , " Quillin explains . <p> " This phase is known as ' lift-and-shift regret ' as costs rise and cloud benefits are still out of reach . To bust this myth , migration must be viewed and planned in the context of a larger , more strategic modernisation strategy . " <p> Re-platform components that have operational benefits <p> Many interpret " lift and shift " as a migration option that requires minimal involvement from the development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes . The hope is to get some benefits of migration without the added work and costs of reengineering the code . <p> But between the code and the infrastructure are database platforms , frameworks , and components -- and opportunities to re-platform them during the migration . Although a re-platform generally requires developers , it may not require substantial code changes , especially when commodity , standardised , or near-equivalent platforms are swapped into the stack . <p> Tomer Shiran , cofounder and chief product officer at Dremio , shares one example . " Rather than lift and shift a legacy data warehouse or data lake to the cloud , a cloud migration introduces opportunities to adopt open lakehouse architectures and data mesh approaches to data management . " <p> Cloud architects may modernise data warehouses and data lakes to deploy them as public cloud services offering operational and cost benefits . Other re-platform options include migrating service buses , moving to an organisation 's standard CI/CD tools , or changing content delivery networks . <p> Reuse , refactor , or rebuild applications that offer longer-term business impacts <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the app modernisation , they have several options : <p> Rebuild modules and capabilities to improve functionality , address defects , or reduce technical debt . Some will rearchitect monolithic applications into microservices . <p> Which approach is best for your application ? Patel shares his point of view : " The refactor and rearchitect strategy , while the most expensive approach , should be considered when companies want to move toward a more agile devops model . This strategy also assists with continuous innovation , ultimately helping increase performance . " <p> Devops teams can also consider phased approaches . For example , they may first rehost apps running on supportable platforms to get the operational benefits of running them in private or public clouds . They can then consider reusing low-use apps that are n't upgraded frequently and rearchitecting other apps where there 's a business need for frequent enhancements . <p> App modernisations are n't free of costs or risks . For organisations with thousands of apps , it can take years to fully modernise the portfolio . Devops teams and architects must use a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an app 's modernisation strategy . <h> Featured <h> Slideshows <p> More than 530 executives came together under the Reseller News roof to celebrate ecosystem excellence and customer value at the Innovation Awards in 2022 .

@@94622237 <p> The OpenSSL project released a patch for two high severity vulnerabilities in the world 's most widely used cryptographic library . The project 's maintainers warned users since last week to prepare for a critical patch on November 1 , but the severity has since been downgraded following additional testing . <p> Organisations should still determine which of their applications and servers are impacted and deploy the patches as soon as possible . The vulnerabilities affect all versions of OpenSSL 3.0 , which has been available since last year . <p> Buffer overflows in X.509 certificate verification <p> The two vulnerabilities , tracked as CVE-2022-3786 and CVE-2022-3602 , are buffer overflow conditions in the punycode decoding functionality that was first introduced in OpenSSL 3.0.0 in September 2021 . <p> Punycode is a system for representing Unicode characters as ASCII and is used for example to represent internationalised domain names in the DNS system . In OpenSSL the vulnerable code is used for processing email address name constraints in X.509 certificates , also commonly known as SSL/TLS certificates . <p> " Any OpenSSL 3.0 application that verifies X.509 certificates received from untrusted sources should be considered vulnerable , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ includes TLS clients and TLS servers that are configured to use TLS client authentication . " <p> Most widely used encrypted communication protocols such as HTTPS rely on clients , such as browsers or applications , checking the identity of the servers they connect to by validating their certificates . In such a scenario , an application would have to connect to a server that would present a maliciously crafted certificate for either of these vulnerabilities to be exploited . <p> An attacker could also potentially force this condition with a man-in-the-middle ( MitM ) attack where they 're able to insert themselves between the application and the server and hijack the application 's requests . <p> In cases where servers are configured to use client authentication , meaning the server also validates the identity of the client by checking a certificate they present , servers would be vulnerable , too . <p> One OpenSSL flaw downgraded from critical to high severity <p> The OpenSSL project does n't use the CVSS vulnerability scoring system . Instead , it has its own severity ranking system described in its security policy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affect " common configurations and which are also likely to be exploitable . <p> Examples include significant disclosure of the contents of server memory ( potentially revealing user details ) , vulnerabilities which can be easily exploited remotely to compromise server private keys , or where remote code execution is considered likely in common situations . " <p> Buffer overflows can theoretically result in remote code execution , but this is highly dependent on the conditions needed to trigger it and the various mitigations used on a particular platform or system . <p> Initially , the maintainers viewed CVE-2022-3602 as critical because it 's a 4-byte stack overflow and CVE-2022-3786 as high severity because the attacker ca n't control the content of the overwrite . <p> However , after further discussion and testing done together with the organisations that were pre-notified of the vulnerability details -- including general purpose OS vendors that bundle OpenSSL such as Linux distributions -- the severity was revised . <p> " Firstly , we had reports that on certain Linux distributions the stack layout was such that the 4 bytes overwrote an adjacent buffer that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crash or ability to cause remote code execution , " the project said in its advisory . <p> " Secondly , many modern platforms implement stack overflow protections which would mitigate against the risk of remote code execution and usually lead to a crash instead . " <p> That does n't mean there are no situations , configurations , and platforms where the flaw can easily lead to remote code execution . OpenSSL is distributed as code and can run on a large variety of platforms , including embedded systems . <p> Applications can also bundle it directly and link to it statically or can use the library included by the OS , if the OS bundles it . However , the maintainers felt that its " common configurations and which are also likely to be exploitable " criteria for critical issues were no longer being met by this vulnerability . <p> OpenSSL 3.0 does n't have wide adoption yet <p> On the server side , the adoption of OpenSSL 3.0 is not yet very high . According to Censys , a company that scans the entire internet IP space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unique hosts on the Internet have one or more services using OpenSSL . <p> Only around 7,000 ( 0.4 per cent ) of those run a version of OpenSSL greater than or equal to version 3.0.0 . Furthermore , of those running OpenSSL 3.0 only a subset likely perform client-side authentication and would be vulnerable . <p> Of course , this telemetry only covers servers accessible from the internet and not those on internal networks , which could also be easily reachable by attackers who gain entry to a network . <p> Cloud and security firm Akamai performed its own scans on customer networks and found that around half of them had at least one machine with at least one process using a vulnerable OpenSSL version . The percentage of machines that used a vulnerable OpenSSL version on those networks ranged from 0.2 per cent to 33 per cent with a median of 6.1 per cent . <p> Since these vulnerabilities are more likely to be exploitable on clients rather than on servers , it 's much harder to determine how big the impact is when it comes to client @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fortunately , an important limiting factor for this exploit is that it can only occur after the issuer of the certificate has been validated . This means that in most cases , if certificate validation is enforced properly , attackers would have to obtain a maliciously crafted certificate from a trusted certificate authority ( CA ) . <p> " While memory overflow bugs can lead to worst case scenarios , the details of this particular vulnerability seem to indicate that the level of difficulty for an exploit is very high , " Brian Fox , CTO of software supply chain security firm Sonatype , tells CSO via email . <p> " The vulnerability requires a malformed certificate that is trusted or signed by a naming authority . That means that authorities should be able to quickly prevent certificates designed to target this vulnerability from being created , further limiting the scope . " <p> Red Hat has released an advisory and released OpenSSL patches for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 . The company rates the flaws ' impact as Important and said that neither SELinux nor Kpatch mitigate them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their applications to version 3.0.7 released Tuesday . The project also released OpenSSL 1.1.1s at the same time , but this is a bug fix release that is not related to these vulnerabilities . <p> The OpenSSL 1.1. x branch is not affected and is still supported until September 2023 , but the project maintainers advise application developers to always use the latest version in their applications , namely 3.0.7 at this time . <h> Featured <h> Slideshows <p> More than 530 executives came together under the Reseller News roof to celebrate ecosystem excellence and customer value at the Innovation Awards in 2022 .

It 's an international partnership that spans most of the world 's time zones , and it really reflects the threat that criminals and cyber attacks bring . " <p> Later , the White House issued a fact sheet stating that throughout the summit , CRI and private-sector partners discussed and developed concrete , cooperative actions to counter the spread and impact of ransomware around the globe .

Photo / Jason Oxenham <p> " I expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial difficulties and it met all of those , and it 's more financial difficulties than I thought , " he said . <p> Brown said he had inherited some surprises that no one was aware of during the election campaign , including three years of major disruptions on the rail network . <p> " It 's like every time you lift a stone here , slaters run out in every direction . " <p> The Herald canvassed three major issues with the 76-year-old engineer and businessman , who promised Aucklanders that his experience of fixing big , troubled and complex organisations made him the right person to be Mayor of the Super City and " Fix Auckland " . <h> Number 1 : Council finances <p> When Brown said Aucklanders are sailing into an economic and fiscal storm at his inauguration 10 days ago , he did not know the city was facing a $270 million budget hole . <h> Advertisement <p> " I did n't have the number but I knew it was grim and the body language from council staff was n't good , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public arena , Brown is assuring Aucklanders struggling in a cost-of-living crisis that the prospect of 12 per cent rate rises is " not acceptable and will not happen " . <p> He 's talking about a " hard-nosed " examination of the council , council-controlled organisations ( CCOs ) and Ports of Auckland , but aware he has to bring the 20 councillors and members of the Independent Maori Statutory Board with him - with a proviso . <p> Councillors and local board members with wishlists for things like new heated swimming pools may find they have a different wishlist from the mayor 's . <p> " My wishlist is not to put further loads on ratepayers if I can possibly avoid it , " he said . <p> There may not be money for new swimming pools . Photo / Alex Burton <p> Brown is also open-minded about selling the council 's 18 per cent shareholding in Auckland Airport , worth about $2 billion - " it 's not like we get anything back from it " , he says about its pause on dividends and need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does try to sell the airport shares , he is likely to face strong opposition from left-leaning and some centrists councillors . <p> Brown has also indicated in a drive to find savings he 's willing to cut funding to the 21 local boards , although he is keen to give the boards more powers and more say over how they spend their funding allocations . <h> Advertisement <p> The big unknown for Brown 's first budget is the long-signalled cost blowout in the $4.4b City Rail Link . <p> After speaking with Transport Minister Michael Wood on the CRL - the council and Government are jointly funding the project - Brown said the minister is similarly in the dark over the new cost . <p> Brown said he had been raising concerns about the new cost for six months , saying the horrible thing now is not knowing . <p> " I think we have been told it the new cost is coming out just before Christmas . " Ho , Ho , Ho , Merry Christmas ' , " he said . <h> Number 2 : Ports of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Ports of Auckland board " to deliver $200m of rates ... plus $200m of dividends " a year , saying last week that is no longer possible through port operations . <p> In his interview , Brown said he still intends to deliver $400m from the port land , but it would be progressive and take time . <p> " There is plenty of value down there . It is not being extracted by having cars on it . " <p> Brown is referring to Bledisloe Wharf , where giant ships currently unload 240,000 cars , plus commercial vehicles , trucks , buses and even trains in a year . <p> The mayor has asked Ports of Auckland chairwoman Jan Dawson to work with stakeholders to come up with a plan and timeline to develop a 16ha area from the Ferry Building to Bledisloe Wharf by March 31 next year , including moving the car trade to Northport , south of Whangarei . <p> She has responded by saying a working group will be set up but raised a number of issues around moving the cars identified in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be passed on to consumers , building new port infrastructure , higher carbon emissions , significantly reduced dividends to the Auckland Council and the impact of 10,000 jobs in Auckland . <p> Brown wants to turn port land into open space , restaurants and apartments . Photo / Michael Craig <p> Brown said the claims are " complete rubbish " , saying when he chaired an Upper North Island Supply Chain Strategy in 2019 , the car exporters said it would cost an extra $100 per car to move the cars to Northport . <p> He said the cost of parking a car on Bledisloe Wharf should be $500 , which is $400 more than using Northport . <p> Brown was also scathing of Ports of Auckland 's payment 's to the council , saying last year 's rates of $970,000 was less than the money it gave away in donations and sponsorships and planned dividends of $17m , $21m and $25m over the next three years are " way short of the mark " . <p> " I wo n't even remotely accept that , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Roger Gray , is doing a better job than his predecessor , but his pledge of getting towards a dividend of $50m a year is " less than Bonus Bond returns " on land he values at $6b . <p> The mayor 's vision is to turn port land into a vibrant area like the Viaduct Basin with a mix of open space , restaurants , apartments and businesses . <p> Asked where things will be at the end of his three-year term , Brown said : There will be work in train making use of the vacated land . Hopefully there wo n't be a pile of empty containers in front of Parnell , hopefully the containers will be on trains not trucks , " he said . <h> Number 3 . Public transport <p> " I have inherited , again , some surprises . Nobody was aware of the fact they were going to dig the rail up until midway through the elections , " said Brown , saying the council family does not have open disclosures . <p> When it comes to shutting down three rail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brown said he wants to know if it is " absolutely , absolutely justified " , saying other countries do not shut down a network but do it progressively . <p> " If it is absolutely unavoidable , how do we speed it up , " said Brown , who is not overly confident Auckland Transport can provide buses as an alternative to trains when the city is short of 500 bus drivers and services are being cut . <p> Looking out , Brown said Auckland Transport will not be getting any money for unwanted cycleways , but he does want them to spend money on roads through the use of dynamic lanes - changing the direction of centres lanes at peak times . <p> Dynamic lanes are used on the Auckland Harbour Bridge and Whangaparaoa Rd , the only road in and out of the narrow peninsula . <p> Brown said dynamic lanes , which do not involve civil works and do not cost much , should be provided on busy feeder roads , such as Dominion Rd , Mt Eden Rd , Remuera Rd and Pakuranga Highway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number one , the Northern Busway , so we want the eastern and western ones under way , " he said .

" <h> The root of our anger <p> There are difficulties in talking about where this anger has come from . The reasons for it are complex and some of the threads and connections sound far-fetched until you sit down and track the pathway from its origins . <p> For example , it might sound like a conspiracy theory to suggest Russia has influenced the social media landscape , yet there is evidence it manipulated US views on vaccines before the pandemic and maliciously influenced New Zealand audiences during it . <p> There is also difficulty because the feared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

The " Brave Project " - a European think-tank called Building Resilience against Violent Extremism and Polarisation - published a report in 2019 describing Europe 's growing polarisation . <p> It found the GFC at the heart of a decade-long path to a polarised Europe . The austerity policies which followed led to many becoming disillusioned with the political parties and practices they associated with financial insecurity and declining living standards . <p> It cited research showing how such problems encouraged voters along the political spectrum to the far-right where they encountered previously marginal views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order that then became mainstream , or normal , parts of the discussion . <p> Brave pointed to research that showed the emergence of " trigger events " in which mainstream media coverage of a specific situation became supercharged once in the hands of social media . In that sphere , those " trigger events " would be " catalysed by social media to recirculate alarmist or outright false news , creating misinformation or filter bubbles that reinforce polarisation " . <p> People consuming that content would be steered to more of the same by the algorithms used by social media companies . That grouped people into communities of interest where an " echo chamber " effect " constructs the appearance that fringe views are mainstream " . It 's a process that shares common ground with brainwashing . <p> Then along came the biggest " trigger event " of all - Covid-19 - and people became more polarised .

There are parts of the country doing well and parts of the country that are not - and they know it . <p> " One of the things that drive people to more extreme viewpoints is a sense of economic uncertainty , " he says , in an echo of Europe 's Brave report from 2019 . With that , he says is a " sense they 're not being listened to or reflected in politics " . <p> Think of the time we are living in as a landscape , says Kate Hannah , director of The Disinformation Project , an independent research group that started studying false and misleading information in February 2020 . <p> Events such as Covid-19 and Russia 's invasion of Ukraine are " once-in-a-lifetime flood events " which washed over a landscape already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infrastructure requiring investment and other societal ills . <p> Working on these pressure points are social media channels in which anger and violence thrive . <p> Asked about comparative time periods , Hannah offers two that match Kitteridge 's reference to an " inflection point " - points where the tectonic plates of history shifted . <p> Hannah puts forward England 's Chartist Reforms of the 19th Century in which the masses sought suffrage . Her second offering , and one which inflames opposition to her work , is 1930s Germany and the rise of the Nazi Party to power . <p> That latter example highlights the exclusionary nature of today 's anti-authority movements . Social media channels for those groups lean heavily on dogma which aligns the shift far to the right described in the pre-pandemic report from the European think-tank Brave . Woven through it are white supremacist touchstones , such as homophobic , racist and transphobic slurs . <p> Hannah describes it as mirroring the pathway that took Germany to genocide . It starts by pointing at groups as saying : " These people are not allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " They are not allowed to be in my country . " Finally , it says : " They are not allowed to be . " <p> It is a conversation loaded with language that dehumanises those who are excluded and desensitises those who speak it to the concept of violence against those opposed . <p> With an election year coming , it creates a charged and volatile atmosphere in which anti-authority groups will seek to be involved . " They want to make the country ungovernable . They 're going to get involved . They 're going to disrupt . " <p> Expect to see organised and pointed heckling , intimidation , and increasing use of false and misleading information to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the electoral process . <p> " MPs ' and candidates ' safety should be much more closely thought about and planned for which will feed into narratives about a lack of transparency . " <p> The physical threat will not come from those groups but from individuals drawn to those groups and compelled by their dialogue . <p> If there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a young man , likely with a history of mental health issues . He wo n't be the motivator of the group . He will be the person at the edge of it . <p> " He wo n't be the person talking the violence . He 's the person who will be thinking it . " <p> In line with Hannah 's description , others interviewed for this piece rejected the term " lone wolf " to describe these solitary actors . It 's a term that was in vogue to describe people such as the Christchurch mosque attacker or the Norwegian terrorist who was an inspiring force but one which overlooked the connection those people had to a supportive ecosystem . <h> How anger works <p> Rising levels of anger in the community can be pinned to " prolonged stress " brought about by Covid-19 and measures to manage it , says Victoria University of Wellington clinical psychologist Dr Dougal Sutherland . <p> " Anger is a natural human emotion . It 's giving us a message - something is irritating us that might be threatening us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's the behaviours that can get us into trouble . " <p> If it were war , then the anger would be directed at an enemy .

@@94680240 <p> What would Auckland mayor Wayne Brown say to a windfall income of a billion dollars ? <p> That 's the amount council sources say the Dubai-based company DP World could be prepared to pay , to secure alease to run the operations of the port . The period of such a lease is not known , but this is a substantial proposal . <p> Brown said yesterday that he wants to fix that deficit through " a combination of head office savings , operational efficiencies , relentless scrutiny of the expenditure and commercial performance of CCOs and the port , and limited rates rises " . <p> He specifically ruled out selling port land . But curiously , he did not rule out or even mention the possibility of leasing the port operation . That contrasts sharply with his statement of October 27 , which carried the headline , " Mayor says no to long-term port operator lease . " <p> Is he shifting his position on this ? <p> Brown 's statement yesterday also contrasts with one put out by the council 's chief executive , Jim Stabback , just a quarter hour after the mayor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-rates revenue " were also on the table . <p> A lease on the operation would not have to lock anything into the Waitemata site . The company is said to be " agnostic " about that and would want a deal that allowed it to operate from different sites . <p> Time for some lateral thinking ? Different sources have told me DP World may want to move the bulk goods operations -- like coal and cement -- to another port , perhaps Tauranga , allowing the vehicle imports to shift eastwards on the existing site . That would free up Bledisloe Wharf and the finger wharves for the " Wynyard-style " development Brown favours . <p> Worth remembering : The port makes considerably more money from vehicle imports than it does from the container operation . <p> DP World , which runs several future-focused ports around the world , is also likely to favour an increased rail operation , taking container trucks and car carriers off the road . <p> Despite Brown 's earlier bombast about no long-term lease , this proposal seems to tick a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an operational lease in his statement yesterday . <h> Advertisement <p> As one councillor told me , " Providing a revenue injection to the coffers of a billion or more ca n't be sneezed at when you 're on the ropes financially .

In a statement last week , he declared the transport crisis in Auckland is " caused largely by Wellington politicians and bureaucrats " . That is , it 's not primarily the fault of Auckland Transport , which he railed against repeatedly during the election campaign . <p> He also said there is " clear evidence staff are concentrating on running Watercare efficiently and effectively and delivering improving service " and was " pleasantly surprised " at the work being done by the events and economic development CCO Tataki Auckland Unlimited . <p> The agency has " responded positively and strongly to the change that is afoot in Auckland " , he said . As for the port company , it is " clearly focused on operating the port more efficiently and safely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is fading . But honestly , it does look like Brown , pre-election , did n't bother to learn much about the organisations he ranted against so often . <p> Not that it 's stopped him from blaming his predecessor for the council 's budget deficit . <p> " The $270 million budget hole is a legacy of former mayor Phil Goff papering over the fiscal cracks and passing the buck to the new governing body , and not being prepared to confront poor performance by Council Controlled Organisations ( CCOs ) and Ports of Auckland Ltd ( POAL ) over six years , " he said yesterday . <p> This is only partly true . The outgoing council 's annual budget for 2022/23 contains a funding hole of $90-$150 million . But that same council was also responsible enough to carve $900 million out of its spending during Covid . <p> The fiscal hole has not grown through six years of neglect , but in the last few months because of inflation . The interest rate on debt is up by tens of millions , wages are up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Nor is it true that the previous council failed to confront " poor performance " by the CCOs . It rewrote their instructions , abolished one of them , amalgamated two others , replaced many board members and pretty much cleaned out the old board of Ports of Auckland . <p> The new mayor is fond of his proclamations , but they do n't always stack up and he 's reluctant to be cross-examined about them . Did n't he promise honesty and transparency ? <p> Moving on . The seven new councillors made their maiden speeches in a special meeting of the governing body last week . Three of them talked about constructive engagement . <p> Julie Fairey from Albert-Eden-Puketapapa said , " I look forward to sharing the mahi with you over the next three years as we make positive change together . " <p> " When I talked to you , Mr Mayor , " said Lotu Fuli from Manukau , " I used the word equity perhaps a hundred times in our conversation . Do n't be surprised to keep hearing it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build a vibrant , sustaining and beautiful Tamaki Makaurau " . <p> Kerri Leoni from Whau sang her mihi and talked about her hopes for a new swimming pool and a community hub in Avondale : " A youth hub for our rangatahi , to help with social and life skills , helping to break the cycles of poverty . " <p> Andy Baker from Franklin , which stretches from coast to coast around the far south and east of the city , took a slightly different tack . Most people he knew were " still confused to be part of Auckland " . <p> His solution : " Maybe we need to tell the story better . We need to empower and entrust our staff and our communities ... Perhaps we need to remember that the wisdom of our communities will always exceed the knowledge of the experts . " <p> The other three were n't interested in this kind of talk . Mike Lee from Waitemata , Ken Turner from Waitakere and Maurice Williamson from Howick were angry . The council , in their view , is full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mayor , who are going to put a stop to it . <p> Lee complained about a " $10 billion goldmine for contractors " , which is a reference to the 10-year cost of running buses , road maintenance and other such contracts . <p> It 's absurd . There 's a good argument the council should be spending more on the buses , to boost driver wages and extend the services , and many people would like more spent on road maintenance as well . <p> Turner complained about speed humps and the council 's new programme for food scraps , which will reduce waste and emissions . He could n't see the value in it . <p> Williamson complained about CCOs " spending time on problems that do n't exist " . His example ? Speed humps around a local school . <p> " The lunatics are running the asylum , " he added for good measure . <p> Perhaps Brown could have a word with them both . He 's said many times he wants councillors to focus on the big problems . Speed humps are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this onslaught of the grumpy guys ? Jurassic World ? <p> " I can walk into a forest , " said Williamson , " and be the oldest living thing there . " He said it , not me . <p> No announcements yet on the shape of Brown 's new council . But he 's brought in a consultant : Public law specialist Max Hardy , a partner at the law firm MC . Some things are already clear . <p> Brown wants the governing body to take over the functions of the finance committee . That would cut out the Independent Maori Statutory Board , despite its having a statutory right to take part in decisions on natural and physical resources . That could produce a High Court challenge . <p> Williamson will probably be given a small committee and a sharp razor and be invited to get to work on council spending , especially in head office . <p> North Shore councillor and Labour member Richard Hills is tipped to head up a new planning committee that includes his old duties in environment and climate change . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big role in the new council .

The " real-life " version of who he is , what he really thinks , and how he expresses it . <p> From the three occasions he has been available for media questioning , it is clear that Brown 's own language , the way he articulates a position , is not the same mayor portrayed in the more copious written material . <p> Brown was confident as he spoke briefly with media the Monday after his election , that all the directors of council agencies could be gone within weeks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the person who had told almost every election campaign audience that it was " all about the numbers " . <p> As he read his way flatly through the pages , Brown spoke of the need to leave the city better than those elected found it : " That means environmentally .

" <p> Many educational programmes related to companion animal obesity have focused primarily on warnings about the health risks involved in obesity , with the blame laid at the feet of veterinarians for not communicating the severity of the long-term risks and/or owners for not responding effectively . <p> " However , encouraging environmental , social , or habit-changing behavioral interventions could potentially result in more lasting change . " <p> The study involved an analysis of data collected over three years , including semi-structured interviews with 28 horse owners and 19 equine professionals ( veterinarians , farriers , nutritionists and a behaviorist ) , 17 discussion threads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Britain , focus groups with 21 horse owners interested in managing weight , and extensive field notes . <p> The analysis indicated that owners lacked the knowledge to effectively identify excess fat on their own horses , particularly if the horse was a heavier breed such as a native-breed pony or cob . " Importantly , this issue seemed to be related particularly to their specific horse , rather than knowing how to identify fat on horses in general . " <p> For example , one person interviewed was a professional groom at a horse charity , and had been trained in condition scoring . " Nevertheless , she needed her veterinarian 's help to identify fat on her cob pony . " <p> Other respondents showed similar knowledge of the existence of condition scoring charts , yet had difficulty in knowing when to apply changes to their own horse 's management . <p> " Owners often had some knowledge of how and where fat might be located on a horse , but applying their knowledge to their horse 's body , then subsequently making changes to management , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that excess body fat was a health risk to their horse , and they often related this particularly to laminitis . <p> " However , because owners found it hard to identify how much fat was on their specific animal , most owners in this study had not made changes to the horse 's management to reduce weight , until an acute health issue such as laminitis occurred , requiring immediate action . " <p> While owners in the study understood that a range of weight management strategies was available , they found it hard to identify what would work within the environment in which they kept their horse , while also maintaining other aspects of their horse 's physical and mental health , protecting the land , as well as being manageable within the owners ' resources . <p> Designing weight management to meet these varied needs , therefore , requires knowledge of a range of different available strategies , which was sometimes problematic . <p> " Respondents and forum participants alike commonly focused on lunging , riding , soaking hay , strip grazing , and using muzzles in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited range of options , owners could therefore quickly feel that they had ' tried everything ' , particularly given the fact that horses could easily thwart efforts to manage weight by , for example , learning to remove their muzzles or breaking fencing . " <p> One described her feelings of futility : " You hit a point and you 're like , I do n't know what else I can do here " , having tried multiple different weight management methods for her cob mare . She had issues with each -- the mare became aggressive when hungry , would not lunge , and was too broad to wear a saddle . <p> In all , 40 different strategies were identified by owners , incorporating a range of relatively unusual practices which owners found fit more easily within their lives . For instance , these included riding one horse and leading another ; using paddock configurations designed to make the horse travel the maximum distance to reach its resources ; borrowing sheep to eat the grass ; turning the horse out with youngsters to encourage play , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participants commented on the social acceptability of overweight horses , in comparison to the lack of acceptability of horses that are even slightly underweight . <p> " Horse owners , forum users and professionals alike considered that the social acceptability of obesity in horses was caused by the prevalence of overweight horses in the local community , in the show ring , and in the media . " <p> Weight management strategies were not perceived as a social norm , and were generally constructed as " cruel " . <p> Many environmental restrictions were identified as a barrier to weight loss in the study . For example , owners on livery yards had little control over the type of field their horses were turned out into , and the hours of turnout . <p> " Frequently , livery yard managers also disallowed electric fencing , which owners might otherwise have used to modify or reduce paddock size . " <p> This lack of control over grazing represented a lack of physical opportunity for weight management for many respondents , the researchers said . <p> " Further , the type of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical opportunity to manage weight , because of the prevalence of high-production rye grasses on many yards , which created an inappropriate environment for horses . " <p> Some owners specifically aimed to create physical environments to better suit horses who were prone to becoming overweight ; for example , creating non-grass turnout areas , or extensive " track systems " , whereby horses were turned out in a series of paths which aim to encourage movement and minimize grass access . Others re-seeded their fields with grasses that they considered more suitable for horses than traditional rye grasses . <p> Owners also described a lack of areas which they perceived as safe for exercising their horses , which contributed to an overall lack of fitness and therefore increased the likelihood of weight gain <p> For horse owners , habits and ritualistic behaviors were commonly seen around care activities , which were perceived as being an important part of a routine for both horse and owner . Feeding was a central part of these ritualistic behaviors , and was positively reinforced by the horses ' responses . <p> The language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as describing horses as being " like a hippo " or " a chunky boy " . Photo by Kyle Mackie <p> The emotions of owners around their horses ' body condition , care , feeding , and exercise were also important in relation to potentially fueling obesity . <p> " Firstly , it was apparent across the data that underweight body condition was perceived to be a threat to welfare , while the presence of fat was often treated with humor . " <p> The language around fat was generally either humorous or cute , such as describing horses as being " like a hippo " or " a chunky boy " . <p> " Such descriptions and responses to fat show deeply held emotions around body image , and are likely to minimize the perceived health threats from fat . " <p> Further , some level of fat was perceived as being indicative of health , and therefore desirable . <p> Although most owners described an awareness of the risks of laminitis as a result of excess weight , it was unusual for them to feel motivated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For many owners , reflective motivation strengthened significantly once the horse experienced a weight-related illness , such as laminitis ; after this point , the owner was often intensely motivated to monitor and manage its weight . " <p> The researchers said their work highlighted multiple themes which made it difficult for owners to recognize equine weight issues , and to change their management of the animal . " Coupled with the obesogenic equine environment in the UK and social norms of equine obesity , this produces a potent setting for horse-keeping . " <p> Their analysis , they said , indicates the importance of equine weight management interventions being targeted to a range of different areas of behavioral influence . <p> For example , there is no point in increasing knowledge and raising awareness if owners are effectively inhibited from making changes because of environmental factors , such as the inability to change turnout areas at a livery yard , or the lack of safe spaces for exercising the horse . There is also the effect of social norms , including peer pressure . <p> The authors suggested following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monitoring behaviors . <p> " However , the present study has also shown the multiple ways that managing animal obesity has additional layers of complexity . These include the fact that horses are grazing animals and owners consider it important to provide almost constant access to forage in order to prevent gastric complaints . <p> " Horses are often kept at livery yards , where aspects of their care may be prescribed by someone other than the owner . " <p> Horse behavior may either promote or inhibit any dieting changes made by the owners ; for example , they may jump out of fields , or become distressed or aggressive when food is restricted . <p> These factors altered the types of weight management strategies available to horse owners , who understandably want their horses to experience a positive mental state while their weight was reduced , the study team said . <p> Given that about 60% of Britain 's horses are kept at livery yards , this provides an additional opportunity for change at a community level , they noted . <p> " Some livery yards are now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overweight or metabolically compromised horses , for example by using non-grass turnout areas with low-calorie forage , alongside opportunities for positive welfare such as living in a herd and accessing different types of enrichment . <p> " These sorts of environments are becoming increasingly popular among horse owners regardless of equine body condition , and could lead more owners to manage weight incidentally rather than actively . " <p> The study team said the complexity of equine weight management highlights the importance of tailoring weight management strategies to the individual human-horse pairing . <p> " Because owners found it difficult to implement changes which brought about negative experiences ( hunger , frustration ) in their horses , our findings also suggest that there would be merit in encouraging owners to consider positive welfare during weight management . " <p> This could involve horses having companions while on restricted grazing , having different types of low-calorie forage to promote choice , or having enrichment such as scratching posts , toys , and obstacles . <p> " This could not only optimize the horse 's wellbeing but also help owners to manage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the regimen over time . " <p> To this end , the authors developed a weight management decision-making tool , which helps owners reflect on the opportunities for change available to them and their horse as individuals , and promotes positive welfare . <p> The study team comprised Furtado , Elizabeth Perkins , Gina Pinchbeck , Catherine McGowan and Francine Watkins , all with the University of Liverpool ; and Rob Christley , with the Dogs Trust in London . <h> Ad Blocker Detected ! ! ! <p> We have detected that you are using browser extensions to block ads .

God , it was exciting . <p> After 80 minutes , you 'd have to say agree , no team deserved to lose that game . But the best teams will take every flicker of good fortune they can muster . <p> And so tonight , the Black Ferns contest the final . <p> I 've told you before about my past experience with the women 's sevens rugby team .

They had a star winger called Portia Woodman and a young smartass cracking jokes in the locker room and putting gangsta ' rap on the stereo , called Ruby Tui . They were young . They were very fresh . But already you could sense extraordinary potential . <p> That team won Sevens World Champs after Sevens World Champs , but when it came to the Rio Olympics , they had to settle for silver . It was a tough experience .

They were the darlings of New Zealand 's Olympic team , and they returned home with gold medals swinging from their necks . <p> Sarah Hirini , Portia Woodman , and Ruby Tui will all start tonight . <p> This game is different , I get that . England are the dominant team in World rugby . Their forwards are incredible . And most obviously , this is a game of fifteens , not rugby sevens . <p> But finals are decided by moments .

@@95016233 <p> In the British Isles , rare equine cases of encephalitis associated with Louping ill virus are reported . In contrast , equine hepacivirus infections are associated with mild acute hepatitis and possibly chronic hepatitis . <p> Diagnosis of flavivirus infections is made primarily by serology , although cross-reactivity occurs . Virus neutralization testing is considered the gold standard to differentiate between flavivirus infections in horses . <p> Hepacivirus infection is detected by serum or liver RT-PCR -- a highly sensitive technique for the detection and quantitation of messenger RNA . <p> No direct antiviral treatment against flavivirus or hepacivirus infections in horses is currently available . Treatment is therefore supportive . <p> Three vaccines against West Nile virus are licensed in the European Union . <p> West Nile , they noted , is the most widely distributed arbovirus that induces equine encephalitis . It was first isolated in 1937 in Uganda , then detected in a few European countries between 1958 and 1970 , reemerging in the late 1990s . <p> " West Nile virus strikingly exemplifies how unpredictably flaviviruses can emerge in na ? ve populations , " they said . " In the United States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City in 1999 , producing large and dramatic outbreaks in humans and horses . " <p> It rapidly spread throughout the country , causing more than 30,000 cases and 1200 deaths in humans , and more than 24,000 cases in horses within a 10-year period . <p> In contrast , Europe epidemics were irregular and limited in time and space from 1996 to 2010 . <p> Until 2004 , only lineages 1 and 3 West Nile strains had been found in Europe . There has been a noticeable increase in West Nile transmission and outbreaks in Europe since 2010 , associated with the spread of lineage 2 strains . <p> In Europe , the most important transmission wave occurred in 2018 . At the end of 2018 , a total of 1503 human confirmed cases were reported in 11 countries in the European Union . <p> Reports from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control also indicated a high transmission among horses , with 285 outbreaks . <p> " It is suspected that , by now , large numbers of horses have been exposed to West Nile virus in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while developing protective immunity . <p> " This , in combination with widespread vaccination , should eventually decrease the pool of susceptible horses and decrease their role in syndromic surveillance systems . " <p> On the other hand , clinical findings in horses might be of help for syndromic surveillance for West Nile virus activity in countries so far considered free of the virus . <p> Usutu virus is thought to have been introduced into Europe multiple times through bird migration , starting in the 1950s . In Europe , the first cases of associated large-scale deaths of wild birds were described in Italy in 1996 and in Austria in 2001 . <p> Within two decades , Usutu virus has spread all over Europe , except for the Baltic countries and Scandinavia , and in 2020 it emerged in Britain . <p> Viruses from African lineages were recently detected in Germany and the Camargue area of France . <p> Tick-borne encephalitis virus is the most important human tick-borne pathogen in Europe and Asia .

" Even with an unexpectedly high infection rate between 20% and 30% of tick-borne encephalitis virus in Austria , Germany and Lithuania , equine clinical disease is rarely identified .

@@95016235 <h> Report reveals major global biosecurity risks of donkey skin trade <p> A new report into the donkey skin trade has laid bare the previously unrecognised serious biosecurity risk posed by the unregulated and often illegal industry . <p> Testing carried out on 108 donkey skin samples from an abattoir in Kenya found 88 were carrying Staphylococcus aureus bacteria , including 44 samples positive for the methicillin-resistant ( MRSA ) strain . Three S. aureus samples were positive for the PVL- toxin known to cause invasive necrotising disease in humans . <p> The findings of the report will be presented at the African Union InterAfrican Bureau for Animal Resources Pan-African Donkey Conference in Dar es Salaam , Tanzania , on December 1 and 2 . <p> Zoonotic diseases are one of the biggest threats to public health worldwide , and unsanitary slaughter methods in slaughterhouses are creating potentially devastating biosecurity hazards , the report says . <p> The diseases identified in the samples taken by The Donkey Sanctuary represent a danger to both human and equine health , even when shipped across great distances . S. aureus has the ability to survive long periods of transit on poorly preserved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the point of slaughter as well as during transit and on delivery in the destination country . African Horse Sickness ( AHS ) can be carried by vector insects ( Cullicoides midge ) , which may have the potential to survive long journeys in shipping containers and infect new equine hosts on arrival . <p> Nearly 5 million donkeys are traded and slaughtered for their skins each year , a trade that international charity The Donkey Sanctuary has been working to eradicate . The global trade in donkey skins results in suffering for donkeys and donkey-dependent communities on a devastating scale . <p> The demand for donkey skins is driven by the production of ejiao , a traditional Chinese remedy believed by some to have medicinal properties . The huge numbers of donkeys involved , the indiscriminate and often unhygienic slaughter , including of those that are sick , the disparate way skins are shipped and transported , and the global nature of the trade , all add up to the high risk posed by skins intended for ejiao production that are contaminated with disease-causing agents . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposed to these skins , the biosecurity implications for the destination countries are considerable . Diseases that are endemic in source countries may not be present at all in transit or destination countries , leading to potential outbreaks of diseases in local , na ? ve equine populations . <p> Marianne Steele , Chief Executive of The Donkey Sanctuary said , there was evidence that the trade was " neither humane , sustainable nor safe and allowing it to continue , given the risks we have revealed , is unanswerable " . <p> " While many may choose to turn away from the direct impacts on animals and people , I would implore consumers , governments and the wider public to take notice of the risks to animal and human health . <p> " The global trade in donkey skins should be halted immediately . If nothing else , the recent lessons of Covid-19 , and the current outbreak of avian flu , should make us sit up and take notice of the emerging threats that zoonotic diseases pose . " <p> The trade currently operates without adequate veterinary and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the trade also means that shipments are often impossible to track , and contaminated skins are therefore unable to be traced . <p> Poor and unsanitary slaughtering conditions are a key contributor to the trade 's biosecurity hazards , particularly in cases where large groups of animals from different populations are brought together . The majority of the trade relies on illegal backyard slaughtering , which increases the risk of donkey skins being contaminated by disturbed soil or other infectious agents . Where multiple species are slaughtered at the same location there is a further risk of cross-contamination . <p> But even skins processed in licenced slaughterhouses constitute a biosecurity risk . All of the contaminated skin samples identified by The Donkey Sanctuary originated in a licensed slaughterhouse in Kenya . In the same month as the samples were collected , consignments of skins were collected from this location and shipped to a destination in China . <p> The Donkey Sanctuary is calling on the governments of China , Hong Kong , Vietnam and Thailand to immediately stop the import of donkey skins , and on the national governments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade in donkey skins . <p> Dr Faith Burden , The Donkey Sanctuary 's Executive Director of Equine Operations , said the findings throughout the report were shocking . <p> " The disease risks for animals and humans are obvious , with poor hygiene at all stages of the trade . The lack of traceability and basic biosecurity should alarm anyone involved in the trade and puts people and animals in general at significant risk . <p> " The skins tested were from one slaughterhouse sourced on one day -- I am sure that skins from other sources and in other countries and continents , if tested , could indicate the presence of other important pathogens such as glanders , equine influenza and African swine fever .

@@95111230 <p> Right up until a stray missile distracted everyone , the attention of world leaders was focused on Egypt and the ongoing COP27 summit . <p> While the great and good thrashed out the details of initiatives to try to moderate the effects of climate change , in Wellington , our MPs were discussing New Zealand 's efforts to act locally while thinking globally . <p> An innovation of this Parliament has been regular special debates on a wide range of issues and coincidentally enough , on Thursday , the House spent an hour mulling over a report from the environment select committee on this year 's Emissions Budget and the Government 's first Emissions Reduction Plan ( ERP ) . <p> These not inconsiderable documents attempt to evaluate how much carbon is emitted and by whom , and then how to go about cutting that back until the what looks like a highly aspirational target of net zero emissions by 2050 is met . <p> Minister for Climate Change James Shaw is currently fulminating in the land of the pharaohs at the world 's lack of progress on decarbonisation , rather as he does when he is at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three budgets ( stretching out to 2035 ) and the first reduction plan , which he announced back in May . <p> It may seem entirely too soon to be assessing progress on a massive reduction drive which has barely got out of the starting stalls as yet , but as the report sets out the plans are indeed new , as well as being comprehensive , and a stocktake at this early stage to identify any immediately obvious issues is probably no bad thing . <p> " We were advised that there are over 300 actions in the ERP that are at various stages of development , " it said . <p> " The initiatives collectively contribute towards three objectives : directly reducing emissions , laying the foundations for future reductions and system change , and ensuring an equitable transition . " <p> The debate kicked off with committee chairwoman and Green list MP Eugenie Sage issuing the standard , but entirely pertinent , warning that climate change is real and that the clock is ticking . <p> In stark contrast to her sensible siren , Environment Minister and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slamming National 's performance in this area , in what National Oceans spokesman Todd Muller in his response called " a disgraceful , partisan rant " , before embarking on a similar exercise himself . <p> Rather than making a wide-ranging verbal assault on the opposite party , Dunedin Labour list MP and select committee deputy chairwoman Rachel Brooking had done her homework and prepared her speech . <p> In fact , in a classic case of over-achievement , she had prepared enough material for about five speeches , a fact Ms Brooking lamented when she had about 90 seconds left of her five-minute call and reams worth of topics she wanted to traverse . <p> " I do have pages , here , of things to talk about in terms of energy , transport , waste . . . I 'll just , very quickly , say that it 's important , when we 're thinking about energy , that we remember that electricity is not all of our energy . <p> " We have electricity , most of which is renewable , but we 've got a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuel and gas , and we want to make as much of that as possible renewable from electricity , so that 's a target of 50% total final energy renewable by 2035 . " <p> As Ms Brooking traversed earlier , the ERP is comprehensive and contains several targets , although as the report acknowledges some of them are nebulous and difficult to quantify . <p> " We ca n't just rely on the emissions trading scheme , because the ETS is all about offsetting the pollution that you are doing when it comes to carbon , not biogenic methane -- that is not in the ETS -- we really want to focus on these gross emissions and how do we reduce our carbon emissions . " <p> The report also wrestles with the concept of " additionality " -- what proportion of any emissions reduction the Government can claim is due to its efforts , over and above whatever initiatives various sectors were putting in place off their own bat -- and the requirement for an equitable transition . <p> However , it was written before the proposals to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for discussion : as Ms Brooking noted , there had been some heated debate earlier about the role of dairy farmers in all this , but not that much light was cast on the subject . <p> This was a big week for Ms Brooking : quite apart from the climate change debate , on Tuesday she got to ask Question One of Mr Parker , on what progress the Government had made on reforming the resource management system ? <p> As a member of the Randerson review of the resource management system in her pre-parliamentary days , let alone as a caucus member now , Ms Brooking was of course well aware of what progress has been made -- the first readings of the Natural and Built Environment Bill and the Spatial Planning Bill will be held next week -- and she had a big smile on her face as she asked her questions . <p> Ms Brooking will doubtless have much , much more to say on that subject in the coming months , although hopefully she will have been able to pare her many worthy words down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Late to bed , early to rise <p> Parliament has been working overtime this week in an effort to clear the books before Christmas , which has forced Dunedin Labour MP David Clark to also work some extended hours . <p> His Companies ( Levies ) Amendment Bill had its second reading on Tuesday night , then Dr Clark had to be back in the House first thing Wednesday morning for not only the third reading of what is now the Plant Variety Rights Act , but also the second reading of his Natural Hazards Insurance Bill . 
@@95111232 <h> Grief of growing up with racism <p> Growing up as a person of colour in New Zealand is like experiencing the five stages of grief . <p> At first , you try to fight it . Then you begin to accept it with bittersweet feelings . <p> In Karlo Mila 's poem " Eating Dark Chocolate while Watching Paul Holmes ' Apology " , the experiences of the persona highlight to the reader that there are stages to growing up with racism in Aotearoa . <p> In this poem , Mila shows the reader a collection of a persona 's memories , triggered by Paul Holmes calling Kofi Annan a " darkie " . <p> At the poem 's beginning , Mila introduces us to this childhood persona who is coming across different types of racism . <p> At 6 years old , this child is thankful to only be " a glass and a-half " so that she could be " safe from dark and bitter accusations " . This shows how racism causes children of colour to lose their innocence at a young age . <p> It 's the first stage of growing up with racism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you that you are brown . As children , we could n't care less about colour and the effects of slurs and the meanings of words . We simply repeat them . <p> However , it 's not until the next stanza that the persona becomes aware of the real-life implications of racism . <p> " What does lynching mean , maka ? " asks the now 10-year-old persona . In this stanza , the author introduces the second stage of growing up with racism in New Zealand : hope . <p> The persona 's recognition of life under racism is through a memory of watching a film with " black men with hurt in their eyes " . The persona is hopeful as she goes on to believe that she can " be a lawyer like matlock " or " the prime minister " . An almost naive approach to take . <p> To know what this 10-year-old child is about to experience and to watch her hope for the future is to know that there may be no hope in our society at all . <p> The 15-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10-year-old once had .

Especially when you 're a teenager , watching the " Mattel man " getting worshipped while " darkies " get " set up " like " fetishes " . The word " fetish " symbolises that New Zealand society often views racism as a taboo subject . <p> It has become so integrated within our communities , but we refuse to acknowledge it . She " ca n't make everything alright for darkies everywhere " . But the racism journey does n't end here . <p> As the persona grows into an adult , Mila takes us to the final step : resolve . <p> To accept one 's fate is considered cowardly in many situations , however , for this persona , it is the bravest thing she could do . The events of this poem have shaped her to accept that she must make peace with her situation . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldier movement " . She believes she can strive to build more for her children , so they do n't have " stanzas of darkie memories " . <p> Every person of colour in New Zealand must learn to entertain racism . Not to fight or end , but entertain . <p> New Zealand society is arguably worse than other societies where people are aware of racism . The problem in New Zealand is that there is no awareness of what is racist . <p> " I 've hurt my family , I may have hurt yours , " Paul Holmes said in his empty and insincere apology . <p> The use of the modal verb " may " shows that he does n't realise what he has really done . People in New Zealand do n't know if they 're racist because as a society we reject the idea completely . <p> Therefore , as a person of colour , the only solution is to trick the system . Play with it , deceive it , and win at the games you play . <p> The stages of growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have shaped the persona 's strategies for dealing with racism in New Zealand . <p> Mila invites the reader to consider if there really is anything that we can do to solve racism , or if we are forever stuck in never-ending " stanzas of darkie memories " .

Photo : Supplied <p> Ivan and Varatchaya Benseman say they would like to see Opotiki District Council upgrade a ford on Motu Rd after their vehicle was irreparably damaged while crossing recently . <p> The couple live on Whitikau Rd , past Toatoa , and say their recently purchased Mitsubishi Outlander electric hybrid was written off by their insurance company after the battery was flooded from trying to cross the Papamoa Stream ford in September . <p> They say they have given up on the idea of an electric or hybrid vehicle . They had only owned the Outlander for four months and Ivan said the battery of the vehicle had been destroyed from trying to ford the stream . He said he paid $37,000 for the vehicle and it would have cost $42,000 for it to be put back together , with no guarantee it would work . <p> Varatchaya said they had now bought an older Nissan petrol vehicle which cost more to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It is not the first time they have had issues with fording the stream . They also had to have a vehicle repaired after failing to make the crossing in July , when there was an extended rain event , and they had to have another vehicle towed from the ford five years ago . <p> Having lived there for over 50 years , Ivan said the ford was running high more often than usual over the past year . <p> He feels the solution is to line the ford with concrete as done with fords in the Gisborne and Thames-Coromandel districts . However , he has not contacted the council about the latest incident . <p> Opotiki council engineering and services group manager Stace Lewer said although Ivan had raised his concerns about the ford to the council on a few occasions , he was not aware of the latest damage to his vehicle . <p> " We do line fords with concrete when the situation is called for . For example , another ford on Pakihi Rd is concrete lined . However , that ford is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> He said the ford was on a section of Motu Rd marked with a sign saying it was recommended to use a four-wheel-drive vehicle . It had about 30 vehicle crossings a day . <p> " This ford crosses a stream with a small catchment and most of the time it has very low flows , and at times it is dry . Of course , after some of the significant rain events recently , it has had higher flows . After these storm events , our contractor crews often need to do some minor repairs , reshaping the ford , usually two or three times a year . " <p> Lewer said with more than 300km of roads , with bridges , fords , and other infrastructure , the council often relied on reports from members of the public when work needed doing . <p> " We encourage anyone to call or report through Antenno when it is needed . " <p> He said the ford was in a wide and flatter section of the valley , so the water tended to spread out over a larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and meander over the years , naturally choosing a different path at times . <p> He said concrete lining was an option and would provide a higher level of service , but would cost ratepayers around $100,000 , which equated to a 1 per cent rate rise if spread across the community . <p> " That would need to be weighed against accessibility and maintenance a few times a year after storm events . The council strives to keep costs down for ratepayers and balance levels of services with affordability . Residents are welcome to submit their thoughts and ideas for new spending on this or any other topic through our website or directly to the council or councillors , " Lewer said . <p> " As always , we encourage motorists to be very careful when crossing fords and streams -- only cross when you know the depth at all points in the crossing and what your vehicle is capable of . Travel at a steady walking pace and do not follow or pass other vehicles when crossing . "

@@95193237 <p> University of Auckland researchers are accelerating the drive towards more sustainable travel , investigating the feasibility of wireless in-lane charging for electric vehicles . <p> The impact of wireless electric vehicle ( EV ) charging pads on a section of Auckland motorway , including economic feasibility , charging lane length , effects on traffic flow and energy consumption , is examined in a recent study . <p> Engineering PhD candidate Ramesh Majhi , Faculty of Engineering senior lecturer Dr Prakash Ranjitkar and Dr Selena Sheng developed a traffic simulation framework and a ' state of charge ' model to evaluate the impacts of dynamic wireless charging ( DWC ) facilities using a 90km section of State Highway 1 . <p> Dynamic wireless charging ( DWC ) pads are embedded into the road and use electromagnetic induction to charge electric vehicles while they 're moving , says Business School research fellow Dr Selena Sheng.The researchers investigated the economic feasibility of the wireless system in terms of the total cost associated with a section of State Highway 1 by comparing it to the cost associated with using plug-in charging stations within 1km of the highway corridor . <p> " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the corridor for a system with a 50-kilowatt inductive power transfer capacity is $1.59 million per year when traffic flows freely compared to $1.42 million per year in the case of peak hour traffic . " <p> The cost variation , says the lead author Ramesh Majhi , is due to faster speeds when traffic moves freely ; hence , more charging length is required to satisfy the demand . <p> Without considering the time it would take to drive to a static plug-in charging station , a wireless charging lane would only be less costly at 125 kilowatts and above , according to the paper . <p> However , when comparing the feasibility of both charging facilities in terms of the total cost , the researchers say it 's imperative to consider the value of time ( travel time , delay , and charging time ) , which is substantially more for plug-in charging stations compared to in-road wireless charging . And at a higher inductive power transfer capacity , such as 75 kilowatts and above , the wireless in-road charging facility becomes less costly compared to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of travel time into account . <p> Meanwhile , as the EV population increases , the time costs tend to become more significant to utilize plug-in charging stations , which will make DWC more feasible and competitive in the future , say the researchers . " As the existing plug-in stations can handle only limited EVs at a given time , with the increase in charging demand , the wireless in-road facility will soon become more competitive compared to the current plug-in charging stations due to savings in costs associated with travel time , delay , and charging time . " " Moreover , with advanced research in dynamic wireless charging system components , the construction cost of a wireless charging lane will eventually decrease , making it more feasible than existing plug-in charging .

This week , we have Lily-Rose Depp , who made headlines after she thought it 'd be a good idea to go on about how it is unfair to call out nepotism babies on their ... well , nepotism . <p> In an interview with Elle magazine , the daughter of Johnny Depp and Vanessa Paradis got talking about the " nepo baby " discourse . The term is short for " nepotism babies " , referring to the children of the wealthy elite and it 's been part of the public discourse quite a bit lately , seemingly due to nepo babies being unable to shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier this year when Gwyneth Paltrow told Hailey Bieber nepotism babies " have to work twice as hard " ? Yeah , I wish I could forget it too . <p> Anyway , Lily-Rose had this to say about her silver spoon : " The internet cares a lot more about who your family is than the people who are casting you in things . Maybe you get your foot in the door , but you still just have your foot in the door . There 's a lot of work that comes after that . " <h> Advertisement <p> She could have stopped there but she did n't . There was also this comparison she decided to make and which I present to you without further commentary : " It 's weird to me to reduce somebody to the idea that they 're only there because it 's a generational thing . It just does n't make any sense . If somebody 's mom or dad is a doctor , and then the kid becomes a doctor , you 're not going to be like , ' Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor .

Nepo babies can get on with reaping all the benefits of being the children of celebrities ( no doubt there are also a lot of downsides to it although I ca n't think of any right now ) . I do n't actually care that their surname opens doors , power to them , whatever . What really pisses people off is the lack of self-awareness when it comes to their privilege , as if their fame and wealth is nothing to do with their name and only the result of hard graft . <p> Italian model Vittoria Ceretti , who also models for Chanel , said it best .

It takes years . You just get it by free day one . I know it 's not your fault , but please , appreciate and know the place you came from , " she added . <p> Therein lies the essence of the nepo baby debacle - the lack of appreciation for where they come from and the opportunities that come from being the descendants of the rich and famous . <p> I am obsessed , I mean utterly obsessed , with Brooklyn Beckham calling himself ' a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tonic with none other than cucumber AND lime ladies and gentlemen ! <p> Speaking of nepo babies making news this week , Brooklyn Beckham thought he would wow everyone by showing off his , ahem , skills in the kitchen by making a gin and tonic .

Before his latest reinvention as a self-appointed chef , Brooklyn launched a few other business ventures , including his very own photography book , hardback proof that , when your dad is a footballer and your mum is a former Spice Girl , there is truly nothing you ca n't do , even if you have not a single ounce of talent to do it and can not even photograph an elephant staring right at you . <p> Anyway , to end on a positive note , I leave you with the comments from a self-aware nepo baby , to prove that it can indeed be done . Ireland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , took to TikTok ( try saying that really fast ) to comment on the whole Lily-Rose Depp thing and had this to say : " As someone who comes from a famous family , who pursued modelling , I would never have become a model if it were n't for who my parents were , " she said in a video . " I was going to modelling agencies with my mum , who is a famous actress and model who came from nothing to become an academy award-winning actress and a model . They 're not there to see me . They 're there to see my mother , most of the time . They 're in awe of my mother 's presence . " <p> See ? That was n't so hard . There is no shame in admitting you 've had it easier than the average person . But if most nepo babies are anything to go by , it looks like the one thing money ca n't buy might very well be self-awareness .

It has only been in the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provisions have been promised , backing the community-led SkyPath project . <p> True to its word , the Labour Government in 2018 instructed Waka Kotahi to implement the consented and peer-reviewed project which was costed around $55m and would take four years to build . <p> But Waka Kotahi dumped the SkyPath design and appointed its own consultants and rebranded it the Northern Pathway . It apparently thought it knew better . <p> For the past three years , Waka Kotahi has worked without public input , to eventually propose a $700m steel structure alongside the Auckland Harbour Bridge . Then , less than two months later , the scheme was hurriedly scrapped by an embarrassed Government . <p> A considerable sum - $51m - had already been spent on detailed designs for the scheme , as well as the requisitioning of a row of houses on Northcote Pt . <h> Advertisement <p> Given all this , it would n't be unreasonable for the public to cast a vote of no confidence in any Government-led campaign for a second Waitemata harbour crossing . <p> To build trust and dispel the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign on its predetermined way to funding a tunnel , it is vital that the engagement process be urgently addressed . <p> Could this be a possible design for the next Waitemata Harbour crossing ? Some experts seem to think so . Photo / Supplied , File <p> The consultation process needs to be transparent and offer communities ample opportunities for authentic and meaningful input . From the outset , there should be a clear and well-resourced programme of extensive and ongoing public engagement across the entire programme .

Rangitoto and the Auckland Harbour Bridge softly enclose a large open space , echoing each other 's form like bookends . Any additional crossing must complement this stunning scape . <p> There is little doubt of the need for an additional harbour crossing for resilience and missing modes of transport .

In Europe 48 million birds have been culled in the last year in an effort to limit the spread , and in the United States 50m birds have died . <p> The disease has also recently been detected in Peru where nearly 14,000 pelicans and sea birds have died . <p> - A Guillemot displaying the classic signs of a strain of Avian Influenza A(H5N1) in Northern England in 2022 .

" <p> That had allowed this strain of bird flu to travel around the globe in a way that had not been seen before , he said . <p> " The nearly 50 million birds that have died in the US , that 's just this year alone and it only entered the country the previous year . " <p> The risk of this strain of avian influenza causing illness in people was low , however it could if it mutated or changed , he said . <h> Fears for endangered bird species if A(H5N1) gets to NZ <p> The birds that are being exposed to this avian flu have no immunity to it , he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in particular , is that we have n't had an avian influenza outbreak here for a very long time , we 've got what we call low pathogenic avian influenza circulating in water fowl , but they 're not going to give our birds any immunity at all to this virus if it gets into the country . " <p> Gartrell said he feared for New Zealand 's more critically endangered bird species if the avian influenza did arrive here . <p> Internationally , measures around the avian influenza were to protect poultry industries and human health rather than wild bird populations , he said . <p> " So trying to control it in poultry flocks and things like that is about killing every infected bird and all of those in an area around it to try and stop the disease spreading . " <p> New Zealand was extremely lucky because of its geographically isolated position which had kept the virus out so far , he said . <p> " But I think we ca n't get complacent about this because we do have migratory birds that come down from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the circum polar regions of the Southern Hemisphere and if those birds can bring it here then ... it only takes one infected bird to get established in a country . " <p> It has been said that if a bird got avian influenza it would be too sick to migrate , he said . <p> The disease had a variable incubation period although generally the time between when the bird became infected and when it started to show symptoms was about a week , he said . <p> Ornithologists have discovered that shore birds could migrate from Alaska down to New Zealand in as little as seven days , he said . <p> A more likely risk was that the disease could leap-frog bird species to New Zealand , perhaps spreading from a species that moves through Europe , to one that moves into Australia and then into a species that moves across to New Zealand , Gartrell said . <p> Seabirds , shore birds were being seen in this outbreak , with migratory water fowl a major way that the virus had been moving through Asia and Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water fowl that migrated into New Zealand , if it came to this country via shore birds and then infected water fowl , ducks would spread it right around the country , he said . <p> The disease could also potentially enter the country via smuggled eggs , he said . <p> The key was to stop it getting here in the first place , he said . <h> MPI response <p> In a statement , the Ministry for Primary Industries ( MPI ) chief veterinary officer Mary van Andel said it was continually monitoring the situation overseas and New Zealand had never had a case of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza . <p> The risk of it arriving was still considered low and there were systems in place to ensure early detection if it were to arrive , she said . <p> That included summer surveillance programmes which screened ducks close to migratory bird sites and liaising with wildlife hospitals and Poultry Industry Association vets . <p> " Biosecurity New Zealand works closely with the Department of Conservation ( DOC ) in preparedness and awareness within New Zealand and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by DOC to sub-Antarctic Islands if an unusual mortality event was detected , " she said . <p> Gartrell agreed that MPI was doing good work , but said he would like to see them doing more surveillance " at that front line " by going out and sampling shore birds and seabirds . <p> The public should notify any mass bird deaths or strange behaviour to MPI 's Exotic Pest and Disease Hotline - 0800 80 99 66 . <p> Gartrell said migratory birds would now start to come in to New Zealand after the breeding season in Alaska and the Northern Hemisphere . <p> Anyone working with the birds on the shoreline who noticed unusual deaths should be very proactive about calling the hotline as quickly as possible , he said . <h> What if it did get here ? <p> The Ministry for Primary Industries said if highly pathogenic avian influenza was detected , Biosecurity New Zealand would be the lead agency to coordinate any response . <p> " Any actions such as movement control , vaccination or culling , would depend on the extent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zoo/sanctuary/pet birds or poultry , " van Andel said . <p> Gartrell said if the disease arrived in New Zealand , based on overseas experience , the most likely approach would be to try and cull any infected birds and any birds that posed a risk of further spreading the infection . <p> There was no clarity on what a mass cull of infected birds would mean for wildlife populations , including endangered birds , he said . <p> There would be some extremely difficult decisions to make if the disease did arrive , and decisions would need to be made very quickly to stop the virus becoming established in the country , Gartrell said . 
@@95434232 <h> Covid-19 's impact on the immune system , and how this may affect subsequent infections <p> Australian woman Cecilia* feels like she 's been unwell most of the year . <p> After recovering from Covid in April , she suffered through a handful of colds over winter . <p> " I felt like I 'd just get over one before the next one hit , " the triple-vaccinated Melbourne mum of two said . <p> " It was really rough for a while . " <p> At the end of October , her eldest child tested positive for Covid . Shortly after , Cecilia did too . <p> " I could n't believe it . It feels never-ending . " <p> Infections soon after Covid-19 - whether it be another stint with the SARS-CoV-2 virus or a different pathogen altogether - are commonplace . <p> And it 's not entirely unexpected , according to Paul Griffin , an infectious disease physician and microbiologist at the University of Queensland . <p> " With other viral infections , sometimes a person can be at slightly greater risk of getting an additional infection or even reactivating latent infections . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have a nasty viral infection , their cold sores might come back . " <p> Plus the Omicron subvariant " soup " currently doing the rounds means the antibodies you generate in the face of one infection do n't necessarily protect you against other subvariants for long . <p> But the reasons some people seem to be more susceptible to reinfection or other diseases after Covid are complex , Dr Griffin said . <p> " There are a lot of factors at play , " he said . <p> " Our immune systems are different at baseline , and those differences increase as we get exposed to different things . <p> " We know past exposure to other viruses might be relevant , for example . <p> " So some immune systems are overactive , while others are less equipped to protect against certain types of infections . " <h> What does Covid-19 do to your immune system ? <p> The SARS-CoV-2 virus tends to infect us via our lungs , but can wreak havoc in all corners of our body , says Simon Barry , a molecular immunologist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ACE2 receptors the virus hooks onto and uses to infect us are n't just found in lungs : they 're everywhere from our gut to our blood vessels . <p> To fight these infections , our immune system springs into gear . It has different cells that work in different parts of our body to try to expel the virus . <p> And it appears that even when we might feel recovered after a bout of Covid-19 , our immune system is still on the mend . <p> Professor Barry was part of a study published in January that , over six months , measured the different types of immune cells in people who were hospitalised with the Delta variant . <p> " In general , in most people , there 's an awful lot of change immediately after getting Covid , and then it sort of slowly normalises over three to six months , " he said . <p> " But there are some subtle immune changes which seem to last a long time . " <p> They found one type of immune cells , called T cells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " T cells are where you get an immune memory response , and that 's critical for the next time you see the virus - you want to knock it off before you get any symptoms , or you knock it off quickly so you do n't get many symptoms . " <p> Similar studies have found other immune cell populations do n't bounce back quickly either . <p> These changes are n't necessarily a drop in number , but more a shift in how immune cells act , Professor Barry said . <p> " The classic thing in immunology is that the number of the cell type you 're interested in has not changed ... but then you look at what they do , and you find out actually they 've reprogrammed . " <p> So immunologists like Professor Barry are teasing out how Covid-19 changes the function of our immune cells and any knock-on effects in the body . <p> " We 're trying to follow up and ask , what are the actual functional impacts of having had Covid inside individual immune cell types ? How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving the pathology ? Is that what we need to repair ? " <h> Why are some people more likely to get Covid more than once ? <p> Once considered a relative rarity , Covid-19 reinfections are now a dime a dozen , with some people racking up four infections or more . <p> In July , the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee , which provides advice during health emergencies , revised Covid-19 's " reinfection period " from 12 weeks to 28 days , meaning a positive test result more than a month after a previous infection should be counted as a new one . <h> So who is more likely to get Covid-19 more than once ? <p> People who come in contact with the virus such as healthcare workers are , obviously , more likely to be reinfected , as are people with HIV , diabetes and obesity , according to a Saudi Arabian study that examined Delta reinfection . <p> Older or immunocompromised people , whose immune system may not be as proficient at fighting off subsequent infections , are at higher risk too . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decrease reinfection risk by doing all the things that have been drummed into us since the pandemic started , Dr Griffin said . <p> " We know people can get reinfected with Covid , and we ca n't assume reinfections do n't cause problems . <p> " So it 's still worthwhile trying to do what you can to prevent each and every infection , and the best way of doing that is some simple strategies about reducing your risk , like social distancing and mask wearing , as well as being up to date with your vaccines . " <p> For instance , a Danish study found a combination of previous Omicron infection plus three doses of mRNA Covid vaccine gave people high levels of protection against subsequent BA.5 and BA.2 infections . <p> A Canadian study during the country 's BA.2 wave found healthcare workers who had two doses of mRNA vaccine plus previous BA.1 infection were protected against BA.2 reinfection " for a prolonged period " . <p> Cecilia is keen to get her fourth dose in the New Year , in line with recommendations from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll do whatever I can to lower my odds of getting Covid , or even getting sick , as long as possible .

He 's heard there is only one shearing gang operating in Northland and those running shearing gangs are finding it hard to get new staff to join their gangs . <p> " If you 're a farmer with say 4,000 ewes and your woolshed is deteriorating , there is a question mark about whether it is economic to build a new one given the money they are getting for their wool , " he explains . " The cost of labour and finding it in rural areas is also a factor -- especially if the tasks are dagging , dipping and shearing . " <p> Morris says in the dairy industry many farmers are moving to once a day milking because of labour issues . He adds this is why they are doing this research work and liaising closely with farmers to show them what Massey is doing . Morris says that already some farmers are breeding up Wiltshire flocks but are about a year behind the university .

He says it is important not to let perfection be the enemy when it comes to making changes on-farm . <p> " We need to start by looking at the choices we make for things we can control like the equipment we use on our farms , " he explains . <p> " I have gone ahead and done everything I can do to eliminate reliance on fossil fuels .

This included upgrades for connecting to the grid and the purchase of frost fighting fans , tractor conversion and equipment , an electric sprayer and an electric vehicle . <p> " For the full electrification of everything on farm there is an incremental payback of seven years and a full payback period of 13 years .

" <p> Tailored Insurance <p> One of the key barriers to Casey setting up a fully electric operation was finding an insurance product that would cover the risk of power cuts to his electric frost fighting fans during the vulnerable spring growing months when young cherries must be protected from the hard frosts in Central Otago . <p> To be completely fossilfuel free , Casey wanted to avoid using a dieselpowered backup generator .

" <p> After spending around 18 months fine tuning the insurance policy , which used interruption cover as a base , Lysaght and Vero created a solution that fits Casey 's unique situation . <p> Lysaght believes more farmers will be seeking tailored insurance solutions in the future as they move towards implementing sustainable farming to mitigate environmental issues . <p> Cancelling the New Zealand Agricultural ( Canterbury A&amp;P ) Show for the second consecutive year because of Covid is devastating to many people .

The regulations that have been poorly designed , with inadequate consultation , need to change . We will bring a pragmatic and efficient lens to the areas farmers have highlighted as unworkable . <p> 2 . The Government 's approach to pricing agricultural emissions needs to be binned .

@@95542238 <h> Ag sector set to weather storm <p> RCNZ chief executive Andrew Olsen believes contractors and farmers are best placed to weather any recession . <p> OPINION : Since the end of World War II , New Zealand has had nine recessions . <p> I 'm not sure any of these previous ones have been engineered by the Reserve Bank -- or at least no Governor has so proclaimed responsibility . However , whether shallow , technical or deep , recessions are a regular fact of life in our economic cycle . <p> And while they are usually accompanied by a lot of gloom ( which can make matters worse ) , recessions are always laden with opportunity for some . <p> I 'm picking the rural sector will , in general , come through next year 's recession better than many of their urban counterparts . The reason was illustrated on November 15 when the UN declared the population of planet Earth had reached 8 billion . <p> Everyone needs to eat . New Zealand produces enough food for fewer than half of 1% of the world 's people , most of which is exported . When recessions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday sales may suggest is already happening -- exported food generally remains largely exempt . <p> Yes , there can be some recessionary sharpening of prices and people may look for cheaper sources of protein but our food exports are already competitive ; our farmers and contractors are innovative and we farm without subsidies unlike many other nations . <p> Besides , prices for dairy and other sectors have been at record highs because international demand is so strong . <p> The world continued eating through Covid downturns and grain shortages caused by the Ukraine invasion . A recession at home and abroad , if relatively modest in size and duration as forecast , seems unlikely to crash export returns . <p> Assisting our farmers to date has been the drop in our currency , which makes our exports more attractive . That weaker Kiwi is adding to inflationary pressures and making the machinery , fuel and fertilisers that rural contractors and farmers use more expensive . <p> However , shipping costs are becoming more reasonable . I also think that our trading banks now weaning themselves off the sugar-hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who can spend as much as an Auckland mortgage on a new harvesting machine . <p> Recessions cause everyone to do a stock take and it will be a more challenging time for every New Zealander -- urban and rural . <p> One consequence may be higher unemployment which some may see as a solution to rural labour shortages . <p> Sorry , but that 's not likely to work in most cases . Sure , during Covid we had a few airline and chopper pilots , among others , turn their hand to driving complex farm machinery for a while though they quickly returned to base when normalcy resumed . <p> Most Kiwis do n't have skills easily transferred to many rural jobs nor any wish to relocate and work the sometimes long hours required . <p> Meanwhile , our farmers are having to deal with a torrent of regulatory consultation and change which may well cause some to give up and seek an easier life , creating more labour demand . <p> That 's more than a shame when we have a world which wants all we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to decide what 's the right course for them . The old saying was that when tough times hit , farmers put away the cheque book . Really determined spending restraint does n't seem to add up when export prices are high and an ever-growing world population needs to be fed . One thing recessions do cause is a decline in confidence . Adrian Orr 's odd jive talking about engineering one is causing the jitters just now . <p> Recession or not though , rural New Zealand is likely going to be doing more than surviving . <p> Declaration : Andrew Olsen wishes it known he is no economist but likes Rob Muldoon 's quote about how you could lay them end to end around the world and still not reach a conclusion .

@@95622234 <p> The Gaming Machine Association of New Zealand ( GMANZ ) is pleased to confirm a recovery in gaming machine revenue to a steady state during Q3 2022 , giving more certainty to community grant recipients who rely on Class 4-provided funding to deliver their programmes and services . <p> Quarterly gaming machine profit ( GMP ) figures recently released by the Department of Internal Affairs shows that between July and September 2022 , gaming machine profit across Aotearoa was $276.3m , a large increase from Q1 2022 , at $193.2m . This increase , after taking inflation into account , indicates a return to roughly pre-COVID levels , following the major troughs as a result of lockdowns and hospitality-affecting gathering restrictions . <p> The increase also means a larger contribution from the Class 4 sector to the Gambling Levy , used to fund harm prevention and support services for problem gambling . The rate of problem gambling in Aotearoa has remained unchanged despite the number of electronic gaming machines ( EGMs ) in Aotearoa dropping from nearly 25,000 in 2004 to 14,000 in 2022 . <p> " We 're very pleased with the positive picture painted by this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " One hundred percent of gaming machine profits are returned to the community after prizes are paid and operating costs covered . This means that about $300m per year will continue to be available for emergency response services , disability support groups , the arts , sports clubs , and other initiatives spread around Aotearoa , " he said . <p> " This funding goes to about 11,000 groups and recipients across Aotearoa every year who rely on it . We 're pleased to be in a position to confirm more certainty of access to this funding , despite the heavy impact of COVID-19 on venues and the hospitality sector since March 2020 . " <p> " Gaming machine profits also fund contributions to the Gambling Levy , a payment to Health New Zealand by all gambling operators and which funds harm prevention services and research into gambling addiction and its treatment . New Zealand has one of the lowest rates of problem gambling in the OECD , with 0.2 per cent of the population classified by Health NZ as problem gamblers . " <p> " Although the Levy has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't seen any real increase in the rate of problem gambling in New Zealand since the 1990s , " said Mr Dengate Thrush .

Rainbow young people disproportionately experience a range of factors that increase the risk of alcohol harm , including marginalisation , discrimination , structural disadvantage , and violence . It is also important to note that the lack of comprehensive , inclusive sex education in Aotearoa is likely to play a role in the sexual harms reported . For too long , the primary focus of sex education has been on heterosexual relations , which negatively impacts our Rainbow students .

That 's why Julia de Bres interviewed parents of trans kids about their actual experiences , and pulled those stories together into a powerful resource . <p> Before I started interviewing parents of trans kids , I drew a picture . <p> In it is my child , bright , smiling and pink . Like the Care Bears of my childhood , she emits a rainbow beam from her tummy to fight evil , and there is a glow around her as she brings her light into the world . I am looking at her in wonder , but also at the dark cloud behind her . As she gazes to the future in all her courage and sparkle , my eyes are on the impending storm . <p> As a parent of a trans child , I am very aware of how the experiences of parents like me are depicted in public discourse . The dominant story portrays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then slowly moving to acceptance via a painful series of phases akin to a grief process . <p> Parents of trans kids are asked to perform this story on the regular to people who turn to us with a curious gaze : " When did you first know your child was trans ? " <p> I know the story is more complex and varied , because I 've been living it for the past ten years , and because I 've watched other parents do the same in an online support group . Here I see parents having a wide range of experiences , positive and negative , with one thing in common -- an unwavering commitment to support their kids . <p> If parents of trans kids only hear negative stories , they have little reason to hope for better . I wanted to ask them how they really feel about parenting a trans child -- how they navigate the hard parts and how they live their lives with joy . <p> I recruited parents of different cultural and social backgrounds -- Maori , Pakeha , Pacific , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and straight -- and I asked them to draw their experience of parenting a trans child . <p> Across the drawings , one visual metaphor kept recurring , which I recognised from my own : storm clouds and rainbows . <p> Rainbows were a recurring motif in the illustrations by parents , including this one by Julia de Bres herself . ( Image : Supplied ) <p> The storm clouds represented the negative attitudes towards trans people that parents encounter in politics , media , and society . For some , these attitudes are remote , in the form of laws protecting trans people from discrimination internationally being removed , misinformation on social media , and attempts to reduce access to gender-affirming care . Others encounter them closer to home , in their interactions with family members , medical professionals , and schools . Even within a supportive immediate environment , these attitudes remain a foreboding presence , one parent saying she was " always waiting for the ball to drop " . <p> There was darkness in these stories , but a different kind of darkness than others imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's gender -- it was everything around them . <p> The rainbows represented the positive aspects of parents ' experiences . In affirming their child 's gender , parents noticed a leap in the happiness of their child , developed improved relationships with them , and experienced personal growth of their own . One described her child as " an effervescent soul ... a beacon of light drawing people towards him " , another as a charismatic " force of nature " who " takes people with her " . <p> Despite the challenges they face , the parents painted an uplifting picture of their experiences , vastly different from how this is depicted from the outside .

Over the 28 minute and 11 second-long video , he answers precisely 12 questions , revealing the inspiration behind the film ( had a vivid dream at 19 ) , the importance of 3D ( " count the number of eyes in my face , there 's two of them " ) and his favourite part of the fictional Pandora ( " the floating mountains are great " ) . At no point in the Q&amp;A did he address the most burning question of all : what 's ? ? with ? ? the ? ? Fox ? ? jersey ? <p> In the early-2000s in Featherston , South Wairarapa -- a place Cameron now calls home -- this cheeky wee fox face was everywhere . Touted as " the leader in motocross and mountain bike gear " , the Fox brand was emblazoned across the chests of 11-year-old boys around the region , often paired with a fetching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two decades later , it seems the only man brave enough to " rock the Fox " in an extremely vast array of settings is 68 years old , and one of the wealthiest and most revered directors alive . <p> Here is James Cameron rocking the Fox at a Terminator : Dark Fate panel at Comic Con : <p> Here is James Cameron rocking the Fox upon arriving to New Zealand to film Avatar 2 : <p> Here is James Cameron rocking the Fox on the set of Avatar 2 : <p> Here is James Cameron rocking the Fox at a panel discussion at Otago Museum : <p> The first question , of course , is why Fox ? I emailed multiple James Cameron fan clubs around the world and not a single one came back to me . I exchanged messages with a kid I went to primary school with who dressed like James Cameron back in 2002 and is now a fashion designer but he said he was " too busy " for an interview . I made some inroads with the people at Fox NZ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were " too busy " for an interview . I even DM 'd James Cameron himself , but he seemed " too busy " to even read it . <p> After throwing out lines across the country -- nay , the world -- I finally got a promising response from two brave sources willing to go on the record about encountering Cameron rocking the Fox in the flesh . Broadcaster Noelle McCarthy and former Dunedin mayor Aaron Hawkins were both on stage with Cameron in 2019 for a panel discussion about his Challenging the Deep exhibit at the Otago Museum . McCarthy recalled instantly clocking the Fox gear in the green room , but was more distracted by the director 's 6 ' 2 ? frame . <p> " I remember thinking ' gosh he really is very tall ' , which I know is a very annoying thing to say to very tall people , " she said . " So I was kind of too busy trying not to say that to James Cameron to think too much about the Fox . " <p> McCarthy , who also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fox brand , but assumed it was " some kind of sporting gear " that Cameron was wearing . " I 'd just spent two weeks before those events reading about how James Cameron likes to plot helicopter rotor physics in his spare time , and design tiny submarine balls to go to the bottom of the Mariana Trench in , " she explained . " I guess it might have crossed my mind that his choice of high-performing specialist athleisure felt appropriate that morning . " As for the overall impact of the look ? " It suited him . He looked great . Ready for anything . Tall . " <p> The other panellist , Aaron Hawkins , recalls fretting about the dress code in the lead up to the event . " It can be hard to pick the tone of an event and dress accordingly , " he said . The organisers asked Hawkins to wear his golden mayoral chains , to which he regrettably agreed . " This was quite soon after the election from memory , and in future I would have politely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James Cameron was wearing , he admitted that " we need n't have worried about formalities " . <p> " The Fox kit did seem like a curious choice , but I did n't realise it was a ' thing ' , otherwise I would have asked , " said Hawkins . " Mostly because I 'm fascinated by militant climate vegans who are also really into motorsport for some reason . " <p> Zoe Walker Ahwa , editor of fashion website Ensemble , has not encountered Cameron " rocking the Fox " herself but did have a message for the director : good for you . " It 's very noughties nostalgia , " she said . " I could absolutely picture some cool young thing wearing the same top on Karangahape Road . It maybe does n't have quite the same effect on a very wealthy 68-year-old , but I do appreciate someone who commits to a look . " She gave special mention to the " repeat wears " of the garment , perhaps an extension of Cameron 's sustainability endeavours . <p> What else could Cameron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " He might be trying to convey down-to-earth relatability , " guessed Walker Ahwa , " but I think what it really says is that he does n't care about the messages his clothes send , that he 's ' above ' thinking about what he wears . " She made no mention of my conspiracy theory , that Cameron is constantly trolling 20th Century Fox , now owned by Disney , who he once told to " get the fuck out of my office " when they suggested that Avatar was too long at 161 minutes . Avatar 2 is 192 minutes . <p> Walker Ahwa had another suggestion that was much simpler and a bit less exciting . " Maybe he just really loves motocross ! " After a little digging into forums , the truth was revealed : James Cameron does , indeed , really love motocross ! In the late 90s and early 2000s he was involved in Day in the Dirt , an annual racing weekend in Los Angeles . " I have spent A LOT of time around James , and he loves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 2010 . " I gave him some good natured shit for having a two-stroke sound effect in T2 . " <p> Perhaps our Jim rocking the Fox is not any kind of statement at all , but just an extremely rich and famous man wearing his down-to-earth , South Wairarapa passions on his sleeve . Cameron never responded to any of my Facebook messages , so the truth will remain a mystery for now . But for those going to see Avatar 2 : The Way of Water this week , keep your eyes peeled for any dirtbike references , fleeting Fox faces or two-stroke sound effects . McCarthy , for one , " ca n't wait " to see it . " Huge achievement from a Featherston filmmaker , " she beamed .

The government will investigate increasing supply of supported housing in Hamilton and Wellington . This is where we arrive back at the immigration announcement . In a detailed analysis of that and its interplay with infrastructure investment , Bernard Hickey writes " Aotearoa Inc has n't invested nearly enough in housing , water and transport infrastructure to cope with past population growth , let alone future growth .

@@95668237 <p> Mayor Wayne Brown last week announced a proposal which would see $60m of cutbacks for Auckland Council , including a complete discontinuation of regional contestable grants . Sam Brooks reports on the impact that would have on the city . <p> If you 've been to an event at the Auckland Writers Festival , a show at Basement Theatre or a day at Polyfest , you have attended something that was made possible by a contestable grant . Provided by Auckland Council , contestable grants are responsible for supporting everything from an exhibition at Objectspace to some of the city 's largest festivals , like Auckland Pride , and even contribute to the Farmers Santa Parade . These grants have now been put up for the chop in mayor Wayne Brown 's latest budget proposal . <p> Released publicly last Monday , the proposal , which aims to fill a $295m hole in the budget , includes advice from staff to discontinue all contestable regional grants . $60m of the hole is set to be filled via " operational savings " , so providing less services than the council currently provides . <p> The discontinuation of contestable grants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also suggests the removal of another $20m from community , social innovation and economic development programmes . This proposal goes to council for discussion tomorrow ( Thursday 15 December ) , where councillors will decide on budget items for public consultation , which will occur in March 2023 . <p> Contestable regional grants , which exist in various forms across every New Zealand city , are a core part of a council 's work ; they enable funding to be given to groups and organisations to achieve community outcomes that council might not be equipped or best suited to achieve . <p> Auckland 's current grants were established in 2014 under mayor Len Brown , when the council acknowledged a gap in their capabilities . The policy -- literally titled Community Grant Policy -- reads : " Having a community grants programme is an explicit acknowledgement that the world 's most liveable city can not be created by Auckland Council acting alone . ... These community-led organisations are experts in their respective fields , and able to mobilise a range of relationships and resources to achieve their goals . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in short : these community grants ensure that all the things that make up a vibrant , lively city actually happen . <p> Hawaiian group from Manurewa High School at Polyfest . ( Photo : Sela Jane Hopgood ) <p> The staff advice to mayor Brown acknowledges that a " reduction in funding " ( in this case , a reduction to zero ) will result in " fewer activities and services " . It also acknowledges that communities in Auckland will be affected by the reduction of those services and activities , especially the communities that have a greater reliance on these funding streams . The risks acknowledged include reputational risk -- although it is suggested that engagement with community groups will help mitigate that -- and that grant recipients that rely on the funding may need to adjust , close their funding or seek alternative funding providers . <p> In response to questions about these proposed cuts , the mayor 's office responded by saying that the mayor is asking local boards to work together to find 5% savings from their total budget , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayor Brown has asked local boards to consider their options carefully , including leases and administration costs , and to consult with their communities about what matters most . " <p> Councillor Richard Hills ( North Shore Ward ) says that the councillors do n't have all the information about what is included in the cuts to these grants , although he 's been asking for details on the fast-moving process . <p> " Cutting these grants would be a dramatic and concerning shift away from supporting arts , culture and community in our city , these grants often provide seed funding to attract far more investment from other organisations and funders , " he says . <p> He explains that the mayor has the right to propose a budget that uses " levers " such as debts , rates and savings to balance the city 's budget -- and that he is trying to fill a $295m hole caused by the pandemic , rapid rises in inflation and interest rates . <p> Stopping the proposed cuts is n't as simple as " not cutting it " -- councillors would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's important for Hills that the consultation documents allow flexibility for change in the budget , to save or increase based on community feedback . Councillors have been told that if they want to protect certain budget lines , they 'll have to propose higher rates or a different thing to cut . Every councillor will have their list of areas they want saved and prioritised -- these grants are on Hill 's list . <p> He sums it up bluntly , and bleakly : " This is not going to be easy and we will need strong feedback from our community on what the council should prioritise . " <p> Auckland Pride Festival in 2021 . ( Photo : Auckland Pride ) <p> Councillor Josephine Bartley ( Maungakiekie-Tamaki Ward ) , worries that the people who are going to suffer most from these cuts are the people that need these programmes and events the most : the community .

" Some groups actually rely on this , and the council recognises that . If this happens , they 'll end up stopping what else they were doing so the community will miss out on what they 're providing . " <p> " We need to think about a city that we want . A city without arts , culture , events and community is not a great city to aspire to want to be a part of . It 's quite sad , really . "

I 'd been chosen to be " honored " as one of the " 10 Most Influential Entrepreneurs from New Zealand to Watch in 2023 " by APAC Entrepreneur Magazine . <p> I 'm not sure how much I really want to be " watched " in 2023 . But Influential ? Moi ? ! Swoon . <p> The lists that magazines and other media put together of successful individuals have become a staple of modern business socio-narcissism . Most inspiring this . Most powerful that . 30 Under 30. 40 Under 40 . Eventually we 'll have an 8 billion under 8 billion and everyone 's mothers will be proud . <p> But until then , we 'll have shorter lists that make those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As I was feeling . For a moment . <p> When I opened the email , the disquiet set in . <p> The email was fully justified . By that I do n't mean I was a worthy recipient . I 'm speaking in the typographical sense . Where " full justification " means that all the lines of text stretch to exactly the left and right borders , like they do in a book . <p> Anyone who 's used email for a while knows that fully justified emails spell trouble . Nobody fully justifies their emails . Unless they 're using Mailchimp . And sure enough , my Superhuman email app showed an " unsubscribe " button , which means the email I was reading had been sent to a list of people . A list too big to easily just send a normal old BCC 'd email . So , uh , more than 10 people . <p> Then there was the copy . After some opening remarks touting their huge readership base and a platitude about how I had " attracted the attention of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they " wholeheartedly welcomed " me " as one among the ' 10 Most Influential Entrepreneurs from New Zealand to Watch in 2023 ' . " <p> Exactly why I was on this list was n't mentioned . It 's easy to drop names into a templated mass-email . It 's much more work to automate the writing of an email that goes into specifics about the recipient . <p> Then , after a whole lot more blurb about this special " honour " ( this time spelt in British English ) , came the kicker . " To support this effort , we have set the standard sponsorship cost of $2,500 . " <p> Yes , just two-and-a-half thousand dollars was all I would have to pay to " enjoy the benefits " of this auspicious honour . <p> I wrote them back . " Thank you for the invitation . How did you find out about me and what is it specifically about me and my company that you think is worthwhile featuring ? " <p> They answered by quoting me a line from the " about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of our inquiry , we discovered , " presumably through a one-minute Google search , " that you created a team of entrepreneurs , researchers , strategy consultants , and designers who collectively work on innovation consultancy , brand building , designing , and much more .

And it really made me think . <p> When people read about the awards and recognitions that media like APAC Entrepreneur publish , they assume that the recipients are worthy . That is , that the publication has spent time studying the industry and its people , and objectively identifying those who 've made an outstanding contribution . <p> These lists are only of any value if we 're sharing information about truly effective people and companies who are worth learning from , so that we can all rise . <p> But the honour bestowed on me demonstrates what many of these actually are -- money-making schemes from publishers who populate their " most " lists exclusively with people who are willing to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It 's the ego-industrial complex . It 's absurd . And it 's more common than you might think . One of my US clients , who has a gender-ambiguous first name , told me he was frequently invited to be part of " most inspiring female leaders " lists . <p> Like his , the email I received was nothing but a fishing expedition . An email presumably sent to anyone in Aotearoa with " founder " or similar in their LinkedIn profile . <p> And what would the resulting list of most influential entrepreneurs achieve ? It would be made up entirely of people who could afford the $2,500 and were desperate enough to want to disingenuously boost their own profile . <p> Is that who we want our entrepreneurial community to look up to , learn from and aspire to be like ? <p> I get that the media business is financially challenging , and that media platforms need financial assistance . I donate or subscribe to many , including The Spinoff , because I believe that journalism is important and valuable and worth supporting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of researching people and determining a fair , equitable list of worthy recipients , I 'd willingly support their efforts . <p> But this mercenary way of compiling these lists means that only those who can afford the fee get featured , which will naturally suppress minority groups , younger people , entrepreneurs at earlier stages , and anyone doing meaningful mahi without a stockpile of cash at their disposal . Most of whom are those that we really should be celebrating and learning from . <p> Is there a better way ? Of course . And it would be the reverse of what 's currently happening . A " 10 NZ Entrepreneurs Worth Learning From " initiative . Any contender would need to be nominated by somebody else . An experienced panel would research and make a considered decision on the 10 recipients .

With two-strokes largely unable to meet strict emissions regulations now , Italjet has had to move the Dragster to a four-stroke engine , settling on a 184cc single-cylinder unit mated to a CVT transmission for the current model . <p> While this sounds like any other scooter powerplant , twist the throttle open and you could swear the engine was larger . Power is 12.9kW at 8000rpm backed by 15.5Nm - good numbers from such a small single-cylinder engine . <p> Match that power to a low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to its name , with acceleration that 's vastly faster than I expected . Heck , I think it 'd give many conventional small displacement motorcycles a real run for their money at the traffic light drags .

@@95836240 <p> Here 's our summary of key economic events overnight that affect New Zealand , with news China is facing a very tough period trying to fix its broken pandemic response . <p> But first , new US jobless claims were little-changed last week at 248,000 with 1.6 mln people on these benefits out of a total workforce of 165 mln people . <p> The final Q3 GDP growth measure for the US came in at +3.2% , topping earlier estimates and topping analysts expectations . Driving this revision was more actual consumer spending activity that earlier estimated . You may recall that prior to the first estimate , there were fears Q3 would show a decrease , but the facts proved the pessimists wrong . Of course they have turned their pessimism to the future and ignore their prior error . <p> This strong data , along with the continuing strong labour market , means the US Fed is far from finished with its rate hikes and there is likely to be more monetary tightening . This conclusion has caused Wall Street to retreat rather sharply today . The Nasdaq is particularly hard hit . <p> After a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American population increased by +0.4% , or 1,256,003 , to 333,287,557 in 2022 . Basically this is because they welcomed 1 mln immigrants this year . For reference , the New Zealand population is growing by +0.2% . <p> In Japan , the bond market has begun to price in the consequences of the Bank of Japan 's decision to give interest rates more freedom . Yields on two-year Japanese government bonds -- the most sensitive part of the yield curve when it comes to monetary policy expectations -- moved into positive territory on Wednesday for the first time in seven years . On Thursday , they held at 0% . <p> While the bank 's officials insists this week 's policy decision is not a rate hike , many observers see the move as a step toward the end of Japan 's negative interest rate era . <p> In China , a Shanghai hospital has told its staff to prepare for a " tragic battle " with COVID-19 as it expects half of the city 's 25 mln people will get infected by the end of next week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Separately , prices for solar panels are now falling very fast . On Wednesday , the average prices of two key types of wafers each fell by -10% or more in the past week . Their prices were down -18% and -25% respectively from a month before . <p> Turkey left its official policy rate at 9% , even though inflation is now up to 84% and their currency has devalued -44% in 2022 . There is no evidence yet that the Erdogan policy is anywhere near working . <p> In Australia , a Parliamentary review of their central bank 's performance has been sharply critical of the way the RBA uses the ' blunt instrument ' of interest rates . In a unanimous report , it said the RBA needed to better consider which households were driving demand-side inflation and whether raising interest rates would affect consumption in a way that curbs it . The parliamentarians do n't want consumers facing intensifying cost-of-living pressures and challenging work and business conditions to be impacted by RBA policy decisions . They seem to not want any measures to fix those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain or consequences . The whole thing is quite extraordinary . <p> In New Zealand as at the end of November , housing loans outstanding rose +$1.3 bln from October to $344 bln , a rise of +4.8% from the same month a year ago . That is the smallest year-on-year rise since January 2015 . <p> At the same time , total bank deposits rose +$3.4 bln in November from October to a record $436 bln . Household deposits rose +$1.0 bln but were up $1.5 bln for term deposits after a fall in transaction and savings account balances . Household term deposits rose to more than $100 bln in November for the first time since July 2020 . ( Their record high was $104 bln in August 2019 . ) <p> The UST 10yr yield started today at 3.66% , and down -1 bp from this time yesterday . The UST 2-10 rate curve is little-changed at -56 bps . And their 1-5 curve is also little-changed at -87 bps , while their 30 day-10yr curve is still barely inverted , now at just -4 bps . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The China Govt ten year bond is little-changed at 2.89% . And the New Zealand Govt ten year will start today down -1 bp at 4.40% . <p> Wall Street has opened its Thursday session down a very sharp -2.9% and falling . It is on track to be -20% down for all of 2022 . Overnight , European markets were down a bit more than -1% except London which was down about half that . Yesterday , Tokyo rose +0.5% . Hong Kong was up +2.7% . But Shanghai fell -0.5% in its Thursday session . The ASX200 ended up +0.5% and the NZX50 ended its Thursday session up +0.6% but on very low volume . The NZX50 is heading for a -10% retreat in 2022 . The ASX200 retreat will be a bit less than -5% over the same period . <p> And oil prices start today marginally lower from this time yesterday at just under US$78/bbl in the US while the international Brent price is just over US$82/bbl . <p> The Kiwi dollar opened today at 62.5 USc and down another - ? c . Against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Against the euro we are lower at 59 euro cents . That all means our TWI-5 starts today at 71 and down another -20 bps . <p> The bitcoin price is now at US$16,636 and down -1.0% from this time yesterday . Volatility over the past 24 hours has again been low again at +/- 0.7% .

Had I been either mature enough or quick witted I might have thought to advise him to keep his eye on the ball , not the boy . Bugger , a bit to late to think that one up now . <p> Banks have migrated away from lending to productive business enterprises because the risk weights can be as high as 150% . Thus around 60% of NZ bank lending is dedicated to residential property mortgages owed by one third of already wealthy households <p> All those loans are an asset to someone , and all the deposits are a liability somewhere in the system . Back when I first looked at M3 compared to total overseas liabilities the two figures were almost the same . A zero sum game . <p> Mortgage debt has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten years before that . For what exactly ? What have we gained form this debt ? <p> Which varieties ? I have a couple myself , appears to be a booming industry at present if the large increase in farmland converted to hops across the tasman region is anything to go by over the last 5 years or so <p> Well I work in and around the development sector as one of ' day jobs ' so that largely explains my interest in , and knowledge of , the housing market . It 's just curious that you have an intense interest in one sub-market . But each to their own <p> I did place a question mark ? asking whether others thought it was a Santa rally . From this point , I favour optimism and recovery over depression and crash for 2023. 2022 brought a lot of bad news already , it can get ' gooder ' for 2023 . I am very surprised by the daily net arrivals , nearly 8000 over last 4 days . 50,000 last month <p> I 'd be interested in people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NZ . The Herald is running an opinion piece from him which resonates with me . Clearly a critic of the " free market " neo-liberal economics and a vision to improving NZs wealth which is not popular with our politicians . <p> Glad you asked . In he past he has written about the limitations of GDP and the how the UK and Norway acted very differently to the North Sea oil boom . However , this time round I found the article vacuous . <p> He states that we need to become an export powerhouse to achieve rich nation status and writes this ; " That will require a massive expansion of our productive sector based on the development of entirely new areas of dynamic comparative advantage . " <p> In mentioning comparative advantage , he is no doubt referring to the work of David Ricardo , but that apart , it 's meaningless . There is not even the faintest hint as to what he thinks these ' entirely new areas ' might be . Without his magical solution he is , I believe , quite wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presented as an essay by a first year student , it would be a big Fail . <p> thanks for that . i agree to the " vacuous " . He offers little substance to support his opinion , even if I tend to agree with those opinions . I did wonder if he he had put some substance into any of his suggested solutions in the past . i think I can see a way for some of what he talks about , but as others have indicated there are some serious ideological blockages amongst our politicians . <p> With a dominant reliance on food production , not to mention over reliance on China as a trading partner , i feel we are too vulnerable . Various politicians have made the call in the past to diversify away from those issues , but they have never had the weight in government to enact the changes required to achieve them . Pity really . <p> A few years ago I read a bit of history of South Africa and the Boers. i was interested to learn that the Boers chose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one else there . All the tribes were further north , so they believed they would not have to contest the land with others . Build a successful working economy based on farming ( Boer is Dutch for farmer ) , and others come for a piece of the pie and are useful to provide labour . Oh yes do n't forget the discovery of diamonds too . Then the politics start ........ <p> Will solar ever be cheap enough to cover the cost of it 's backup ? Germanyhas just spent $700 Billion on intermittent , rather than nuclear , energy and is now burning record amounts of coal . <p> " The continent has invested in wind and solar energy while closing dozens of coal-fired power plants over the past decade . When it is cloudy or the wind is low , and demand is high , Europe does n't have the capacity to maintain electricity supplies from clean sources . <p> At that point , power prices rise to encourage utilities to fire up fossil-fuel plants . Gas mostly filled the gap in recent years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because Germany and other countries brought plants back online , and partly because gas is so expensive that it is more profitable for utilities to burn coal . " <p> " Coal markets have been shaken severely in 2022 , with traditional trade flows disrupted , prices soaring and demand set to grow by 1.2% , reaching an all-time high and surpassing 8 billion tonnes for the first time . " <p> I think that 's a very good question . I do n't know what the EROI of solar arrays or wind turbines is currently , but I doubt that they are close to the EROI of oil , even though that has been declining for decades . In order to build the renewables , we must use fossil fuels . I was intrigued by some figures Science and technology in January this year . <p> To replace the energy output of a single 100 megawatt natural gas turbine-producing enough power for 75,000 homes , would require 20 wind turbines each some 500 ft. tall and collectively requiring some 30,000 tons of iron ore , 50,000 tons of concrete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1000 tons of specialty metals and minerals such as copper , chromium zinc etc . In contrast , the gas turbine requires only about 300 tons of iron ore , 2,000 tone of concrete and 100 tons of specialty metals and minerals . <p> I conducted an experiment on the Wellington housing market , which cost me a bit of money , so I hope you all appreciate it . I listed my Wellington rental property ( excellent condition , tightly-held , sought-after suburb , above Healthy Homes standard ) for sale for a short time , just to get a feel of the market . The tenants were moving out so I was n't causing them any inconvenience . <p> Traffic through open homes was very good , with private viewings also held . The agent was surprised just how much interest there was . We ended up with two offers , which is almost unheard of right now , especially for such a short run . <p> I expected the offers to be low , but I was surprised just how low they were : 37.5% and 42% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2018 RV . At this valuation I still get more in rent than I would from a term deposit . <p> The first offer was from a young couple , who were throwing everything they could at it , with a little help from parents . I suspect the second is a cashed up investor fishing for desperate sales . There 's no mortgage on the property so I do n't need to sell and have strong interest to rent it , but I found this a fascinating insight into current market sentiment . <p> Survey of one disclaimers apply , of course , but if this property is getting such offers then I do n't hold out much hope for the outer suburbs and satellite cities . <p> I 'm ok if you doubt my intentions . As I said , the tenants were already moving out so were happy to assist , the agent was a good friend we 've used for years and was also happy . He was paid , cleaners/gardeners were paid , no one 's time was wasted . Not everyone lives their life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force them to visit the property under duress nor require them to solve a series of increasingly fiendish tests to receive an invite to an unknown event . <p> If they were born any time in the last 50-odd years they would have viewed the property online first , made a conscious decision as to whether or not they felt they should view the property first-hand , and chosen to undertake that journey . If the process had unearthed someone who offered what I considered a reasonable price I would have actually sold it , but I set that limit at about 15% below RV , and no one approached it , so no sale . <p> No . It 's as much a test for buyers as it is for sellers . i know of others who have done the same . Put it on the market but not desperate to sell unless a good price comes along . <p> Can be a catch 22 though . In six months those offers may be more than 50% lower , and as house values drop , the potential for rents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intent/need of the owner/seller is . <p> You 're either missing it , or I 'm not explaining it properly . It seems you 're hung up on the word " experiment . " <p> I 'm 50/50 as to whether or not to hold the property , it really does n't matter either way to me . I 'm also what I thought was realistic about where the market sits , but have since discovered through this process that the market is in far worse shape than that . Had my ( incorrect ) low expectations been met , there would have been a happy new home owner , but that 's not how it worked out . <p> I figured this could be useful intel for those looking to buy in the current market , to let them know where things sit ( again , with a survey of one ) , as well as intel for those looking to sell as to what the could expect . I 'm sorry if this intention has offended you . <p> Keep posting general , many of us here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spruikers do n't want to hear real stories of low offers , perhaps because they and their kids are long at the top ... or they are agents who are going hungry this xmas . <p> It should be pretty obvious to most there 's a general market downturn in residential real estate . <p> On the flipside , the case studies often being used , often by yourself even , are outliers . " Check out this ' high end ' property that needs a million or so of work " , etc . Good for a bit of dramatic effect , but also wickedly anecdotal . <p> Of an older FHB or investor property they chucked in the market to gauge interest . <p> I got places selling around me going for below , at , or above CV pricing . Nothing 's going for less than about 5% less . Will that turn into 40 ? Maybe . I can say there 's more listings and they 're taking longer to sell , but then again there 'd been half as many houses on the market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that an efficient property investment is supposed to make more net income than the equivalent cost of buying the same house , buy a significant factor - for all the risk factors involved that you 'll be aware of . <p> If we do n't get a rerun of the UK situation of the early 90s , when I could have mortgaged my spare home at 6% - **or so I thought ! ( NB : Like you , I did n't have a mortgage on it ) , yet rental income was a gross +12% , I 'll be surprised . <p> ( ** I did actually go to my bank to seek a mortgage for tax ' sake - 50% LVR , as I recall - and got rebuffed , as " We are cutting back on lending to the investment property market at the moment " . That , too , is in the offing here as ' things ' deteriorate ) <p> Why would anyone pay the RV when it 's totally not realistic ? The income of people do n't match the prices of land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disconnected market and everyone is to blame for it . <p> Every one involved in real estate including the governments of past 15 years are to blame for it . Everyone is clipping their ticket with no one really worried about who is going to pay in the end . <p> Totally a system which is like a cancer killing the body its feeding on and then getting killed itself once the body dies . <p> Goes to show the confidence anyone has in the wellington housing market , and why it is slowly draining of residents over time , which I feel will continue until housing is more affordable there for the average joe . Mos buying to live there understand there will be substantial rate hikes to fund the infrastructure such as the dilapidated pipelines through the city , the tip is nearing capacity and then there 's the sweage .
