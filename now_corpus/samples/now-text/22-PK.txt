This has been something that has happened in Pakistan before -- uncertainty leads to people trying to buy dollars which in turn leads the dollars to go short from the market and the price of the dollar in the open market being significantly higher than the dollar rate in the interbank market . <p> To confirm these suspicions , your correspondent visited multiple money changers in Karachi . What quickly became apparent was that as far as small quantities were concerned , around less than $500 , most of the money changers were selling them without hassle at the rates quoted on the board . Some were charging a premium of up to Rs 3 and were willing to negotiate . For larger amounts , however , it was a little trickier and more expensive . Matters were no different in Lahore and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complained to Profit about money changers charging an exorbitant premium even on small amounts of the dollar . One such buyer informed me that the best rate they could find for a mere $450 purchase was Rs186 on a day when the dollar selling rate was not even Rs179 . <p> The practice of money changers selling currency at a higher rate than it is actually worth is a common one . However , the practice increases around December because of the holiday season , and becomes particularly bad because there is a high demand for the greenback during this time of the year . This year , it was worse because Pakistan was going through negotiations to continue its programme with the International Monetary Fund , and with there being political as well as economic uncertainty , it seemed that the country was headed towards dollarization at least on the savings front .

@@53489238 <h> The challenges at the end of the tunnel <p> Pakistan is no easy place to govern , especially for a government that is in the tail-end of its tenure . After facing several crises since coming to power in 2018 , the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) government is facing challenging situations on the economic , political , and national security fronts . Three important issues are : rising inflation , the resurgence of terrorism , and the change of guard in the military high command . Successfully navigating these challenges in 2022 would help increase Prime Minister Imran Khan 's electoral chances , paving the way for him to become the first politician in the country 's history to be reelected to office . <p> It should not come as a surprise to anyone that the most pressing issue needing attention is rising inflation . In recent years , households across Pakistan have experienced a dramatic decline in purchasing power and inflation is unlikely to ease anytime soon due to a weak rupee , higher indirect taxes , and persistently high commodity prices . While significant blame can be placed on past policies -- the stabilization pursued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and high international commodity prices in 2021 , the government can not ignore its own shortcomings . This is particularly true in terms of the government 's failure to pursue long-needed structural reforms and prioritization of policies like the real estate amnesty scheme , which only end up benefiting the few at the expense of the many . <p> Forecasts for the first half of 2022 predict higher oil and commodity prices , meaning that the external sector situation will remain challenging at best . The second-order effects of adjustments made under the IMF program will also fuel further inflation , making it extremely difficult for the government to maintain economic growth while effectively dampening inflation . To ensure that rising prices do not wipe away the PTI 's electoral chances along with citizens ' purchasing power , Khan and his team will have to reform markets , starting with the agriculture sector , and stop telling citizens that things are still cheaper in Pakistan when compared to the rest of the world . <p> Pakistan 's leadership does not want to accept the reality that the country is currently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takeover in Afghanistan has significantly complicated the domestic terrorism challenge and things will only get worse in 2022 . According to publicly available data , 219 security personnel were killed by terrorists in 2021 , making it the deadliest year since 2016 , when 291 security personnel were killed ; from 2020 to 2021 , security personnel casualties by terrorists have increased by 23 percent . While the government has sought to negotiate with the TTP from what it argues is a position of strength , it is unlikely that any further talks will yield positive results . Greater violence seems inevitable given recent skirmishes on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border , where Taliban security personnel have allegedly torn down fencing put up by Pakistan , and the sharp uptick in IED attacks and targeted assassinations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa . <p> As the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan worsens in 2022 , the Taliban 's control in the country may weaken . This could lead to the emergence of safe havens for a variety of terror groups , including ISIS . These terror groups are likely to collaborate with external actors , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor . A sustained increase in terrorism violence that spills into Pakistan 's urban centers will also dent investor confidence and fuel uncertainty , making it that much more difficult for the PTI to make the case for its reelection both to voters and the military establishment . <p> Given Pakistan 's political history , a change of guard at the military high command is always a sensitive decision for all prime ministers . General Bajwa 's upcoming retirement in November 2022 will be a key test for the prime minister , especially given that Khan seems to have a clear preference for Bajwa 's successor . Khan 's pushback during the change of guard at the ISI -- something well within the constitutional rights of a prime minister -- has already dented the government 's " same page " narrative . Islamabad is rife with rumors about a growing civil-military divide ; growing speculation is fueled by the opposition 's ongoing engagement with the military establishment and the PTI 's devastating loss in the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa local bodies elections . <p> While the November 2022 change of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and set the tone for the 2023 general elections , the way in which Khan and his cabinet deal with the economy and Pakistan 's second war on terror will ultimately make or break the PTI 's electoral chances . Pakistan 's political system is always full of speculation and conspiracy theories , but these stories have low impact value . While elites may engage in secret negotiations and seek to make deals to suit their own interests , voters will ultimately go to the polls and make their voices heard based on economic and security concerns . <p> To come out on top , Khan must do more than just hope that inflation eases , terrorists agree to and uphold a ceasefire , and the military establishment stands by him due to a lack of other options . Hope is not a strategy .

We had been planning to go to the beach since last week with Delma to look at the oysters which were washed ashore , " exclaimed Dazel . <p> " Oh it 's okay , " came a voice from inside the cave . It was Derek , Din Din 's younger brother . " We can take care of ourselves . You do n't need to do us a favour . We are n't babies , " Derek finished scornfully . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If they do n't need me , why should I spoil my day and sacrifice for them ? " <p> In a huff Din Din set off towards Delma 's lake . Dazel followed him quietly not knowing what to do . <p> From Delma 's lake the three friends set off to the beach that Delma had discovered a few weeks ago . Delma swam alongside them as Din Din followed Dazel 's low flight towards the white sandy beach . But Din Din was unable to relish the scenic route . He kept thinking about his brothers . <p> " I wonder if Derek and the others have had their lunch . Mum had asked me to heat the fruit stew for them .

" she cried out in pleasure . " This is exactly what we wanted to see ! Come Din Din . Are n't they adorable ? " <p> Delma swam up to Dazel and Din Din , near the ridge of rocks where the oysters lay . " You know , Olly the Octopus our teacher at Aquatic School , was saying that there are some oysters that can be eaten . However , these oysters here are pearl oysters . " <p> " Oh wow !

In fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four oysters produce perfect pearls . " <p> " Din Din , you are awfully silent . Is anything the matter ?

I 'm worried about how they must be doing without me and I 'm also feeling terrible because I 've broken my mother 's trust . She gave me a respon-sibility and I did n't do what an elder brother should , " finished Din Din helplessly . <p> Dazel replied , " Din Din , if you want to go back , we can return . We do n't want you to be miserable . " <p> " No , my friends . This is my problem and I must face it . I want you both to enjoy your day at the beach . I can find my way back , " said Din Din as he backed away . <p> Dazel flew after him but Delma stopped her , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He can follow his tracks back to the lake and then to Fruit park .

What will mother say when she returns to find them alone ? " <p> Finally , Din Din arrived at his cave at Fruit Park breathless and agitated . To his relief , he saw Derek and his other brothers playing outside the cave with marbles . <p> " Oh , I 'm so glad you all are safe , " panted Din Din . Just then their mother came into the clearing of caves . <p> " Hello , dears . Did you all have a good day ?

" <p> His mother replied groggily , " What 's the matter dear . Are you feeling unwell ? " <p> His mother followed him outside the cave where the night breeze blew softly . <p> " Mother , I left Derek and the boys today to go to the beach with my friends , " he said quietly , his green head bowed in shame . <p> " What ?

" The conscience is your inner voice which tells you what is right and wrong . If doing something makes you uncomfortable then that 's your inner voice telling you it 's wrong . But the conscience has a soft voice ; you need to listen to it very carefully . If you stop paying attention to it , it will eventually fade away .

@@53501232 <p> The two-day Seminar is being jointly organized by the Government of Pakistan and the Independent Permanent Human Rights Commission ( IPHRC ) of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation ( OIC ) . <p> The following are full remarks by the Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi at the International Seminar on Corruption and Human Rights ; <p> " Excellencies , <p> Distinguished Panelists , <p> Honourable Commissioners of the OIC IPHRC , <p> Ladies and gentlemen , <p> At the outset , I would like to extend my gratitude to the OIC -- Independent Permanent Human Rights Commission ( OIC-IPHRC ) for organizing this very timely Seminar on combating corruption and assessing its dire consequences on the achievement of the human rights agenda . In line with Prime Minister Imran Khan 's vision , fighting corruption and ensuring protection of all human rights are the top priorities of our Government . We are therefore glad to host this important meeting in Islamabad . <p> Ladies and gentlemen , <p> Corruption is an enormous obstacle to the realization of all human rights -- civil , political , economic , social and cultural , as well as the right to development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and democracy . It erodes public trust in the legitimacy of state institutions , undermines the rule of law , and violates the values of transparency , accountability , justice and fair play . It also undermines the successful implementation of all 17 Sustainable Development Goals ( SDGs ) by hampering economic growth , increasing inequality , and inhibiting prosperity . In particular , corruption stifles opportunities for the poor and marginalized and condemns them to a life of misery and inequality . It leads to massive illicit financial flows out of developing countries . In addition to deadweight economic losses , corruption creates inefficiencies and dysfunctions and skews the allocation of public resources away from those most in need . The United Nations High-Level Panel on Financial Accountability , Transparency and Integrity ( FACTI ) has calculated that a staggering 7 trillion dollars in stolen assets are parked in the financial " safe havens " destinations . This organized theft and illegal transfer of assets has profound consequences for the developing nations . There is no doubt that this stolen money siphoned off from the public treasury could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of poverty ; to provide children with education ; to bring essential medicine to families ; and to stop hundreds of preventable deaths and injuries that occur every day . The COVID-19 pandemic has further widened existing inequalities , pushed millions of people into extreme poverty , and resulted in loss of millions of jobs . Allowing corruption and illicit financial flows to continue in these circumstances is nothing short of criminal . Immediate and robust national and international action is needed to stop the bleeding of developing countries . <p> Ladies and Gentlemen , <p> 15 years have passed since the adoption of the UN Convention against Corruption ( UNCAC ) , which remains the only legally binding international instrument on anti-corruption . Unfortunately , despite explicit UNCAC provisions , there are increased barriers in the asset recovery process as well as their speedy return to countries of origin . Curbing illicit financial flows and recovering and returning stolen assets can contribute to effective resource mobilization for achieving SDGs . We continue to emphasize that the requested States should return the recovered assets without conditionalities to the States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional protocol on asset recovery under UNCAC . At the same time , framing corruption as a human rights issue and pursuing a ' human rights-based ' approach to corruption can help complement the efforts to prevent and combat corruption and promote more effective implementation of international anti-corruption instruments . So long as corruption remains undefeated , efforts to promote the realization of human rights can achieve little . <p> Ladies and Gentlemen , <p> Islam is a religion , which guides all aspects of human life . Fighting corruption in the Islamic context is rooted in the Holy Quran and the teachings of the Prophet Mohammed Peace Be Upon Him , both of which extensively address the major types of corruption , such as bribery , extortion , nepotism , and favoritism . Deriving guidance from the Islamic teachings , Prime Minister Imran Khan has given a vision of ' Corruption free ' Pakistan . We have undertaken measures to build and strengthen robust systems for accountability , transparency and integrity . We are trying to pursue a proactive three-pronged approach to combating corruption , including awareness raising , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to induce transparency and openness in the public sector including through facilitating citizens ' right to information . Pakistan 's Citizen Portal app has received international recognition for an effective use of technology for enhancing public delivery . Due to our sustained efforts , visible positive socio-economic changes are taking place in the country . Prime Minister Imran Khan has also been regularly highlighting the need to combat the scourge of corruption at the international level , particularly to address the phenomenon of illicit financial flows . Pakistan spearheaded a resolution on the role of Parliamentarians in combating corruption at the 8th Session of the Conference of States Parties to the UN Convention Against Corruption held in Abu Dhabi , UAE , in 2019 . At the recently held 9th Session in Sharm El Sheikh , Egypt , last month , Pakistan joined Nigeria and Palestine in jointly tabling a resolution on enhancing transparency into beneficial ownership information . We will continue to promote this issue at all relevant international forums . <p> Ladies and Gentlemen , <p> The OIC countries must actively explore innovative ideas and initiatives to strengthen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impunity . Today 's seminar is an opportunity for all of us to explore and develop these ideas further . The FACTI Panel 's report and first-ever UN General Assembly Special Session ( UNGASS ) against Corruption with its Political Declaration adopted last year served as important milestones in the global efforts to prevent and combat corruption . However , these documents will not transform into meaningful actions without dedicated follow-up processes . To this end , the OIC countries must take bold initiatives . As a first step , the OIC may consider establishing an open-ended intergovernmental ad hoc committee to prepare concrete and technical proposals for supplementary legal frameworks . While conducting its work , the proposed ad hoc committee of OIC experts could focus on the following priority areas : -First , establishment of an OIC protocol and implementation mechanism for mutual legal assistance within the OIC countries on issues of corruption and stolen assets ; -- Second , developing a coherent , transparent , and inclusive mechanism under the UN auspices for strengthening the international legal framework on monitoring illicit financial flows and return of stolen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ registry ; -Fourth , reviewing and revising unequal investment treaties procured through corruption . Once finalized , these proposals could be presented to the UNCAC Conference of State Parties for consideration . <p> Ladies and Gentlemen , <p> In conclusion , Pakistan 's commitment to eradicating corruption remains clear and firm . Our fight against corruption is essential to achievement of 2030 Agenda and the sustainable development goals . We must join hands to address the underlying factors and enablers of corruption at both the national and international levels .

Stuart Broad and James Anderson steered England to 270 for nine at the close of play in the evening gloom , well short of the victory target of 388 but a huge turnaround after heavy losses in Brisbane , Adelaide and Melbourne . <p> Australia skipper Pat Cummins was unable to use pace in a tense final three overs because of the fading light and his predecessor Steve Smith took his first test wicket in almost six years to dismiss Jack Leach for 26 with his leg spin . That left Australia needing one wicket in the last two overs but Broad and Anderson , despite as many as eight fielders crowding around them , stood firm to frustrate the home side .

@@53530235 <h> Destination IMF <p> January 14 , 2022 <p> To go or not to go to the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) has been a question dogging the PTI government since 2018 . On Jan 11 , 2022 , Prime Minister Imran Khan expressed fears that the government would have to go to the IMF again if Pakistan 's exports did not increase sharply . After remaining in power for three and a half years , if the government is still undecided about how or when to approach the IMF , it is once again displaying a complete lack of understanding of the challenges Pakistan has been facing . Somehow the government has been unable to realise that from the word go , exports needed a boost . This called for a comprehensive strategy to enhance the export potential of the country , but the economic managers kept dilly-dallying . Then the question of tax collection remained unresolved as there were multiple and competing narratives being peddled by the fiscal authorities in the country . The government should have identified some main driving agents to boost the country 's economy . Instead , the government kept focusing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . <p> On top of it all , the price hike that people have suffered for over three years now has not abated a bit , with most food items pricier and even bare essentials becoming hard to buy . It is a no-brainer that a country can not boost its exports if there are hurdles on nearly every step . If exporters face bottlenecks at every turn of the export procedures , business owners get tired and investors shy away from any new investments . To give a spur to the economy , exports need a smooth flow . Some of the conditions that the IMF imposes on its target countries hamper wealth creation , rather than improve it . The export sector has been stagnant for a long time now , and the government 's facilitation is not up to the mark . It appears to be more interested in complying with the IMF conditions by introducing the mini-budget that is likely to do more harm than good to the citizens of Pakistan . <p> Though registration of the retail market in the country may be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other than the countries where retail markets are fully registered . The same applies to tax automation that the IMF recommends as a one-size-fits-all remedy to its target countries . More than automation , the country needs an active and equitable tax culture . Higher tax ratio should also reflect in better public services , without which taxpayers do not have much incentive to pay their taxes . The current government has increased its tax collection but there has not been any corresponding improvement in public service . The IMF also wants all countries to go on a privatisation spree in even public amenities such as education and health . The health-card initiative is a case in point which will involve insurance companies and the private sector whose reputation is not above board . In short , the government must approach carefully the path that the IMF recommends .

The second generation of the processor has been named as M2 .

The new MacBook may not get more ports other than the two USB-C ports and the headphone jack especially if its as super thin it is said to be . <p> Well most of the things discussed here are rumors so we have to wait for the actual launch to see what the New MacBook will offer and how true all these rumors are . <p> PhoneWorld Magazine is a premium quality magazine for Pakistan mobile Eco System that focuses on the burning issues of the industry be it Policy , Regulations , Operators , Distribution , Application Development , Devices and Academia bridging the gap between all stakeholders in Pakistan providing objective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Readmore

The earlier relationship , which offered no alternative with the patron and the audiences , came to an end . Now , there was the choice of listening to music through the recorded disc . This alternative changed not only the face of music but also the relationships between the patron and the musician and the musician and the audience . <p> Now the musician was a faraway thing and a bit of a mystery . The sound , so to say , came down from heavens like the nawai sarosh . The direct link was severed and the listeners were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his or her idiosyncrasies . This created a new image of the artistes ; existing on a spectrum between two extremes - a virtual god and also a creature steeped in sin . <p> This also provided a kind of relief for many who were either afraid due to public pressure or wary of the musicians for their artistic proclivities and temperament . Listening to music thus became independent of the centres or locations that housed musicians . One could disengage and still listen to music no matter how only a select few could were invited to the patrons ' baithaks . The fear of being seen in the bazaars of musicians and dancers was thus removed and listening to music became an experience that did not result in social or moral backlash . <p> The musicians became the prerogative or the responsibility of the recording labels . They only interacted with them at human level . With the advent of radio , a new source of accessing music became available . Many a household acquires a set . These were mostly placed in the mardana , in the baithaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forbidden to listen to it . It was also not unusual for a public site to be identified for the installation of a radio set that could be switched on and off under the direct supervision of the elders of a family or a tribe . <p> The buying and then listening to the radio generated the same kind of fiery debate as every technological breakthrough has done . It was castigated as an instrument that spread vulgarity and obscenity and that the colonialists were trying to use to destroy the moral fibre of the society in the subcontinent . For decades , the radio was avoided or was not a proud possession . Rather , it was something that was kept hidden . Usually the young and the newly-married stealthily acquired the radio and kept it stashed away from the elders , listening to in in deep secrecy while alone . <p> Listening to music thus became independent of the centres or locations that housed musicians . The fear of being seen in the bazaars of musicians and dancers was thus removed . Listening to music became an experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Both the gramophone players and the radio were huge cumbersome contraptions that needed electricity to function , though some gramophone players could be mechanically wound . The portable transistor-based radio that operated on portable batteries changed the entire social ethics , taste , habits and norms . It was followed by the portable record player which was given a tremendous boost by the invention of the cassettes and the playing apparatus . The cassettes were low on maintenance , cheap and run on a portable player that could be operated both on dry batteries and household electricity supply . These then were carried proudly and flaunted in open spaces without fear -- even as a trophy and a sensational acquisition . This coincided with the Pakistanis scooting off to the Gulf so that the proud demonstration of the new found wealth included the cassette player sometimes in gota and resham wrapping . <p> The cinema , too , dislocated the actor and the musician from their art . In theatre , the actor was there in person and could be seen or met after the performance or in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the popular singers the voices from heavens . Hugely popular in the subcontinent , this brought its own cult where the human side was displaced by the larger than life images that had nothing to do with the flesh and blood person . <p> Today the most accessed source of listening to music or viewing films is streaming , both live and in recorded versions . The apparatus that makes it possible is the mobile phone . The entire world is in the palms of men and women , in most countries . It can be accessed by the illiterate , the semi educated and the most highly erudite . The great diversity and easy access to the world has moulded a taste that is highly eclectic . The clubbing together of instruments and technologies has created an amalgam that defies an easy explanation . The polyglot has also created the social mores and mannerisms that correspond to it all as well . <p> The charged response to the change is from a fixed position we imagine we have firmly hold on to . The emphasis on religion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more as the fast-changing technological revolution requires a corresponding set of values . Flexibility is often decried and condemned in favour of the fixity of cultural values . The mismatch of the two makes everything either a sliding down the hill or disintegrating .

Talat Abbasi like Sara Suleri and Kamila Shamsie , is more interested in the life of Pakistani women in general , as compared to Sidhwa who speaks a lot about her Parsee community . The title Bitter Gourd and Other Short Stories is symbolic of the values of our society and sufferings of men and women because of some traditional values of our culture . It is because of the portrayal of women and their socio-political issues at center stage that most of her stories depict feministic trends as Muneeza Shamsie says , " The book , Bitter Gourd and Other Stories , is permeated with a feminist consciousness and her stories capture the predicament of women trapped in oppressive marriages " . <p> The title story ' Bitter Gourd ' becomes representative of the voice of young sacrificing females who earn and provide for their siblings in case their parents die .

Struggle and the courage to survive is the principle in the minds of young women like Nilofer in the modern Pakistan . They are ready to face the bitterness of the relatives and the society in general , but would not budge from their stance .

Abbasi says that when the in-laws saw that she was losing money from her pay , a bit more every time , they beat her and warned her that there would n't be a next time for forgiveness . They further threatened her that they would throw her out , even though she was their dead son 's widow . <p> The character of Shano is designed to show the aggressive yet vulnerable side of the female whose income is snatched from her and is accused of having illicit relations with the other people .

@@53583236 <h> National Security Policy : Good Start , More Needed ( Part II ) <p> The first part of my two-parter opinion on the recently released national security policy focused on commending the good start , defining and then suggesting adding national identity and national purpose to the conceived national security framework , recommending clear and succinct articulation of vital national interests and touching upon instruments of statecraft needed and the underlying national security strategy required to make the execution of the national security policy a success . <p> This second and final part recommends and explores more granularly the execution arm of instruments of statecraft and the national security strategy so that a wholesome framework can be built around the national security policy . <p> While statecraft relates to skilful management of the affairs of the state , an instrument generally refers to government departments that partake in this activity . Hence , instruments of statecraft are governmental structures and pillars of the state that run the affairs of the nation and must be tasked to execute and support not only the national security policy but also the complete national security framework including promoting the defined national identity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pillars of state are executive , legislature and judiciary . The executive should be asked not only to lead and manage the nation as per policy objectives in the national security policy but also to inspire through individual and collective conduct . The legislature should be tasked to establish laws , and related oversight , in line with not only the Pakistani constitution but also with the national security policy and established national interests . The judiciary should interpret the constitution of Pakistan to ensure that any further judgements and precedence do n't go against the national interests . Media , the unofficial fourth pillar of the state , will need to play its crucial part as well . It should ensure balance and fair reporting of the facts and limit analysis and conjecture so that they do n't threaten the policy objectives of the national security policy . <p> The instruments of statecraft , defined as all governmental structures and pillars of the state , are needed to support both policies under the guise of the national security strategy . <p> Government structures or the ministerial enclave is divided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and execute the national security policy . While the primary ring includes ministries of foreign , finance and defence , the secondary ring consists of ministries of interior , information and education . <p> The foreign ministry will need to promote and preserve the national interests as linked with the national security policy of Pakistan . It will also need to enact a foreign policy that is in line with the national security policy and its objectives . In the annals of national security , something that is quite often overlooked is the ministry of finance . In this new paradigm set up by the released national security policy , the finance ministry will act as a strong undercurrent to achieve policy goals established by the national security policy and the foreign policy . This will be done by using economic statecraft in the form of positive or negative sanctions along with ensuring the best playing field and support being available to the local market including favourable regional and global economic conditions . The defence ministry will secure national and territorial sovereignty and integrity as per the national security policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring is headed by the ministry of interior which will ensure the protection of citizens of Pakistan in line with the national security policy . Ministry of information will play the key role of affirming and reaffirming the policy ends of the national security policy in a way that is simpler to imbibe by the local population . The education ministry will uphold an objective and historically correct account of religious and geographical past to produce ' thinking individuals ' capable of rationalising and aligning with the policy ends reiterated by the ministry of information . <p> National Counter Terrorism Authority ( NACTA ) and the National Security Division ( NSD ) need to be tasked to prepare , present and implement a national security strategy that is in harmony with the national security policy . It needs to cover at least two big aspects -- counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism . <p> The counter-insurgency policy must take a leaf out of the recently released national security policy . I had previously suggested that Pakistan 's counter-insurgency policy can be defined as " assimilate where possible , eliminate where needed " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the insurgents are given a fair chance to be co-opted where feasible while knowing that they will be dealt with an iron fist where required . If one word was to represent this policy , it would be " reconciliation " . That is , the policy would reconcile -- through assimilation or elimination -- any unfavourable skewing of power between the government and the insurgents . The objectives of this policy will be threefold . One , negotiate and assimilate all willing forces and individuals . Two , defeat all non-amenable insurgents and groups . Three , win the hearts and minds of the local population to isolate militants &amp; criminals further . <p> The core strategy to execute this counter-insurgency policy of reconciliation can be termed SHAPE the environment . Where each letter of the word SHAPE stands for a particular operational and tactical activity . First , stop and call off Jihad as per the definition of the extreme-right elements . Second , halt Jihadi operations and disband Jihadi groups . Third , announce amnesty for all where possible except criminals and retaliatory elements . Fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , enlist all amenable individuals into relevant security arms . <p> Moreover , I had earlier also defined Pakistan 's counter-terrorism policy " to stand resolute in the elimination of , and protection from , insurgents " . This would translate into a one-word counter-terrorism policy of " resolve " . That is , the policy will espouse and ensure the resolve to confirm an end to the wide activities of insurgents and terrorists . There are three objectives of this policy . One , eradication of insurgent leadership . Two , elimination of terrorist safe havens and protection from them . Three , removing conditions that non-state actors use to cultivate resources . <p> For the case of the counter-terrorism policy of resolve , a POTENT strategy is to be actioned . Here , each alphabet of POTENT also stands for a specific operational and tactical action . One , a prepared government and people . Two , organised for firm action . Three , tenacious in their beliefs and ends of this strategy . Four , enabled to stand together . Five , never give an inch to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism policies are clearly linked to Pakistan 's national security policy and national interests . Thus , ensuring alignment throughout the chain . The instruments of statecraft , defined as all governmental structures and pillars of the state that run the country , will need to be required to support both policies under the guise of the national security strategy . <p> Executing a national security policy is not an easy task but a good start has been made by the current administration . It should now allow further vigorous discourse on the content of this policy and assimilate constructive and wholesome suggestions to make it an improved version that reflects the need of the hour and acts as a lynchpin for the nation for years to come ! <p> ( To Be Continued ) <p> The writer is Director Programmes for an international ICT organization based in the UK and writes on corporate strategy , socio-economic and geopolitical issues

After the advent of tech-giants , mainly Facebook and Twitter , the dynamics of struggle as well as resistance against oppression , brutalization , injustice , and violence have dramatically changed . It is pertinent to point out that struggle and resistance have been part of civilizations before the invention of social media , but the form in which they were carried out was by paper or document , if one was to consider the media used .

The majority of protestors were youth . Starting from Tunisia , the movement ended with the toppling of Ghadafi , Morsi , and Ben Ali . It was the youth who challenged the authorities , and thanks to social media the movement came to fruition at last for some nations . <p> The second in the list of examples is the popular Chilean women protest in 2019 against sexual harassment .

Patriotism indubitably knows no boundary between ethics and law . <p> The fourth in the list of examples is recently organized protests in Gwadar , Balochistan . The one-month-long protest , unfortunately , did not get any national mainstream coverage .

Next time , any opposition would prefer to resort to unlawful ways to topple the government under the dread that it can be outmaneuvered by any unconstitutional means afterwards . The water of politics has got muddied . Uncertainty has crept in . The question is this : what have the military and the higher judiciary learnt from the crisis ? The making of a hybrid regime in the hope of running the country vicariously and with ensured exclusion of two mainstream political parties has failed to yield any fruit . <p> Second , Pakistan has been plunged into a severe economic crisis .

Emphasising its importance , Marc Andreessen , an American entrepreneur wrote , ' Software is eating the world ' . Indeed , digitalisation has revolutionized every other field of life . Amongst the many areas , where its impact is visible is entrepreneurship . <p> Digital technologies are rapidly facilitating both Small and Medium Enterprises ( SMEs ) and ' Innovation-Driven Enterprises ( IDEs ) . SMEs rely more on traditional business approaches and their scope is limited to local markets . The potential net revenues of such businesses are relatively easier to forecast and are less risky . Digital applications ( or apps ) have especially enabled SMEs to structure and manage their businesses and services . Furthermore , social media has also aided SMEs to expand their work by promoting it on various platforms . In contrast , IDEs aim for a business style guided by the pursuit of products or services for regional and global markets . This does not necessarily refer to giant technological discoveries ; rather such ventures offer new approaches for various economic activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the innovation itself is technology driven .

In the first three quarters of 2021 , Pakistani start-ups raised $244 million , which is more than the amount of the previous six years combined . Start-ups such as Bazaar , Airlift andMaqsad have emerged as multi-million dollar enterprises.This shows that there are immense growth opportunities for IDEs , especially in sectors like health , agriculture , climate change , green infrastructure , and education , amongst others . <p> On the positive side , the Government of Pakistan has been trying to cultivate a business environment that supports IDEs .

@@88892236 <p> WHY is direct lending by the State Bank of Pakistan to the government mostly harmful ? And why is government borrowing from commercial banks less harmful , despite being a bit more expensive ? These two questions continue to perplex many experts . As direct credits from the SBP to the government will be illegal following the legislation of recent amendments to the central bank law , answers to these questions are of paramount importance . Ill-informed discussions lead to misleading conclusions . So let us be informed about the related issues of lending and borrowing . <p> A financial system based on interest always works through the process of ' financial intermediation ' . The primary step of this process is the mobilisation of savings by raising deposits . The secondary step is the channelling of these savings to investors through lending . Both the primary and secondary steps are essential to this process , notwithstanding their connotations . Lending can not take place without the mobilisation of deposits , but without lending , deposit mobilisation can still take place . Our banks and non-bank financial institutions work as ' financial intermediaries ' . They raise deposits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and making a profit through a margin ( the difference between lending and deposit rates . ) <p> Government borrowing from the State Bank hinders savings . <p> When we make a deposit , we are lending our money to the bank at their deposit rate . In addition to this rate , we are comfortable knowing that our money remains safe with them , and we can take it back anytime . We , therefore , agree to receive a lower return compared to what banks receive in extending loans . Banks must charge a higher rate to cover for the risk of default by borrowers . In this system , people with an account are incentivised to save their surplus funds with the lure of safekeeping , meeting withdrawal needs , making payment to others and getting returns that would not be possible if they kept the cash with themselves . Whenever lending rates go up , deposit rates also go up , although not necessarily at the same rate . In short , this system promotes savings , while lending funds to investors . <p> Now imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial banks . This raises the demand for credit , without an increase in deposits ( savings of the people ) . Lending rates will then go up and deposit rates will rise thereafter , giving people with cash some additional incentives to increase deposits . This process of financial intermediation has some built-in mechanisms to promote savings , besides making loans accessible . In popular and even in expert discussion forums on the borrowing or interest rate , the entire debate revolves around the ' poor borrowers ' and seldom around savers . So do not expect to be enlightened by these discussions . In fact , these discussions always have the ability to mislead anyone . <p> It should be clear by now that government borrowing from commercial banks should promote savings . Is this also true when the government borrows from the central bank ? Of course not . Why ? Because it depresses the interest rate that would have resulted otherwise . Therefore , government borrowing from the SBP hinders savings . This leads to lower amounts of loanable funds in our financial system , lowering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the private sector . It is not necessarily high lending rates which restrict our investments . It is low savings rates . While there are many reasons for low savings , one of these is government borrowing from the SBP . <p> Now imagine a situation when the SBP does not give any direct credit to the government but continues to meet the demand for liquidity by banks through open market operations . Commercial banks , in turn , continue to lend to the government , albeit at slightly higher rates , which filters down partly to depositors keeping them incentivised to save more . The ill-informed discussants will concentrate on the aspect of commercial banks taking undue advantage of the government 's lost power of borrowing directly from the SBP and keep on ranting about unrelated issues about sovereignty , forgetting that no one can take away the power of issuing fiat money from the government . <p> Direct credit from the SBP to the government impedes savings . This can be aptly called an ' effective saving inhibitor ' . This is not the only drawback of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone 's money saved earlier . Direct credits lead to the printing of additional currency . Most of us are already familiar with the inflationary impact of government borrowing from the SBP , but its main illness stems from a savings inhibition . One might object to the reasoning given here and say that indirect credits to banks also lead to money printing . Even if the entire amount of money borrowed by the government from commercial banks is injected by the SBP , it will not impede savings . Often , the amount injected is less than the borrowed amount . As savings start to build up , this may further go down . The most critical point here is that savings mobilisation should be the prime mover catering to the borrowing needs of economic agents including the government . Direct central bank credits should not be the prime movers , but should always be available to banks through open market operations or other refinancing windows as supplemental mechanisms . <p> The strong negative association between direct SBP lending to government and national savings would be extremely hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whom fail to find a positive association between this harmful lending and inflation . The prevailing media obfuscation of political , economic and financial issues , under the garb of alleged loss of sovereignty , is nothing but a fear originating from moribund minds . Real sovereignty comes from our own national efforts , our own savings and our own investments as opposed to borrowed efforts , borrowed savings and borrowed investments . National sovereignty should never be confused with the ability to borrow from one 's own central bank , or the fiat of issuing unlimited currency . I am glad to observe that many young researchers , economists and analysts , and a few older ones , are free from this confusion , which bodes well for our future .

But the SBCA still grants real estate developers NOCs , dismissing the KWSB 's concerns . <p> Heritage sites located within Karachi 's delicate ecosystem are also impacted by these projects . The growing influx of people and businesses in non-high density zones has led to traffic congestion and attracted encroachers , all of which pose serious threats to the original landscape of the region , rich in culture and history . <p> Of course , a city like Karachi is always growing and transforming . We need to find a way to make room for the city 's growth , and imagine a brighter future while honouring its past . <p> GROWTH AND THE CITY <p> Map of Karachi with the ' old town ' demarcated .

It shows the various different quarters inside the old town with their respective names for comparison and better visibility Illustrated by Hani Arif <p> Karachi is a city of great economic promise . This port city is where people from across Pakistan come in search of employment opportunities . But even before ' Karachi ' existed as it does today , this land by the sea was already an economic hub . The city is also home to a long history that needs to be protected . <p> World over , historical districts keep elements of important tangible and intangible heritage alive . They express the identity and collective memory of cities . Karachi is no different . We propose that the ' old town ' of the city should be protected . By old town we mean the pre-Partition downtown of the city . This was the city centre from where everything emerged and grew outwards . It was initially adjacent to Bandar Road , which led to the port and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But instead of encouraging mindful development in this area , institutions such as the SBCA can be seen neglecting the city 's past to compete in the race of progress . While doing so they emphasise on transforming the city with high-rise buildings . But , although these buildings may look phenomenal from afar , they are a false projection of the future . A future with tall buildings , contaminated air and an even greater risk of climate change is not the kind we should be aiming for . <p> With a past waiting to be accentuated and celebrated , and a present begging for changed priorities , Karachi needs to preserve its beautiful heritage . <p> In the book Climate Change as a Threat to Peace Elizabeth Longworth writes , " cultural heritage plays an important role in supporting sustainable development , disaster risk reduction and building community resilience ... " It is exactly for these reasons that heritage conservation should not only be given priority on a provincial level , but monitoring methods should be implemented at a national level to ensure the process of conservation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strive to transform into a ' people city ' -- a place which emphasises its history and proudly displays it for its citizens . <p> More and more policymakers are understanding the importance of such cities around the world . Indeed , we can see success stories not too far from home . <p> LEARNING FROM OUR NEIGHBOURS <p> ' Old towns ' in other cities Illustrated by Hani Arif <p> In her book Perceptions of Sustainability in Heritage Studies Jyoti Hosagrahar , author and deputy director for the World Heritage Centre at Unesco , writes that South Asia has experienced and observed " unprecedented and incessant " urbanisation where " rapid growth and globalised development have transformed cities and towns , and posed a threat to the heritage assets , values and the identity of historic places " . <p> This phenomenon can be witnessed in Karachi and in other large cities in Pakistan as well . But while Pakistan is not the only country which is faced with the problems Hosagrahar lists , it is among the few countries which have failed to devise any plans to combat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heritage assets is even more difficult in ' developing ' countries , where the wave of ' modernisation ' came not in the 19th century , but later in the 1950s and 1960s , usually around the time political independence was achieved . This fast and rapid construction to compete with ' developed ' regions has caused damage to ' developing ' ( formerly colonised ) cities across the region . <p> But our neighbours have still managed to progress . Despite their colonial histories , countries such as Sri Lanka , Turkey , Bangladesh and India are all known for celebrating their cultures . This is reflected in their construction and planning , with great significance being placed on individual identity and community building . <p> The Turkish government , for example , realised that bans and prohibition do not discourage vandalism . So they focused on educating people and tried to invoke genuine concern about heritage in them . They also revisited their laws . Now a percentage of real estate tax will be spent on heritage preservation . <p> By taking systematic approaches , and through institutional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without compromising on their respective economic developmental goals . <p> Hosagrahar further emphasises that because of their colonial past and a widespread influence of " dominant modes of development focused on increasing GDP " , the heritage of developing cities such as Karachi is being worn away . <p> But if cities around us can find ways to not only protect their heritage sites but , in many cases , also tap into revenue streams by turning them into tourist attractions , surely Pakistan can do the same . <p> MOVING FORWARD , WITH THE PAST <p> In light of the expansion of cities and urban transformations , heritage districts witness everyday deterioration due to neglect and lack of monitoring . It is imperative to acknowledge how integral cultural and historical architecture is to the process of reimagining the urbanised future of Karachi . <p> There are many aspects to the conservation of heritage which need to be considered in order to move forward towards sustainable implementation . There is an urgent need for a long-term plan , which involves devising a rehabilitation plan that serves as a resourceful addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be better integration between the SBCA and the Sindh culture , tourism , antiquities and archives department . Effective implementation of laws will remain an unachieved -- and unachievable -- goal if there is an institutional disconnect between the departments . <p> The rehabilitation plan must place emphasis on the interior of heritage buildings and also on their landscape . Karachi 's heritage buildings and sites have extensive research potential . But due to the real estate boom in the city , the landscape is compromised and , too often , heritage sites are compromised . To avoid this and to ensure more mindful construction in the future , stakeholders need to be actively held accountable . <p> Heritage laws discussed above focus mostly on punishments , stating that if the rules are violated , there will be serious consequences . But we can also learn from other approaches around us . For example , Bhutan ' offers owners of heritage buildings incentives for the effort they put into these structures ' maintenance . This encourages public support and also motivates building owners to support the government in preserving historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also discussed by renowned architect Arif Belgaumi . In a conversation with one of the writers of this article , he said that up until a few years ago , the SBCA used to have a clause related to the ' Transferable Development Rights ' , which could serve as an incentive for people to willingly let go of their properties categorised as heritage sites by the government . <p> The clause enabled owners to sell their property in prohibited areas in exchange for a property in an area where development is encouraged . This would allow the landowners to gain more money from development than they would have if the TDR scheme had not existed . <p> The clause served as reassurance for the building owners , and provided protection not only for the heritage sites , but also for the interests of people who look after them . However , this clause is no longer a part of the SBCA laws , which makes the owners or caretakers of inherited heritage sites sceptical of cooperating with the government . <p> Analysis of the aforementioned document by the Karachi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which apply to the Transferable Development Rights clause <p> Analysis of the aforementioned document by the Karachi Building and Town Planning Regulation in 2019 shows that the conditions related to the Transferable Development Rights are no longer listed and eliminated from the latest bylaws compilation <p> Preserving heritage sites demands attention from both the developers and the average citizens . Thus awareness programmes and campaigns must be initiated . <p> Heritage Walk Karachi ( HWK ) , a project of the Pakistan Chowk Community Centre , is such an initiative started by the writers of this article . HWK enables and invites people to walk together and explore historic buildings . It provides citizens with a platform to engage with the city 's history . It also aims to narrow the gap between heritage sites and the public . <p> But small initiatives by the citizens can only achieve so much .

@@89614235 <p> One 's senses immediately get a strong whiff of prior acquaintance when Rehbra opens . Talking fast and showing faster -- the narrator 's voice compliments the quick overview of the backstories -- we run straight into Bubbly ( Ayesha Omer ) and Danish ( Ahsan Khan ) , an odd pair with poles-apart ideologies . <p> Bubbly , a young woman from Lahore who is set to marry in the coming weeks , thinks first and asks questions later . Danish , a real estate magnate who stars in his company 's commercials -- because he is just that good looking -- thinks first and then lets his actions speak for himself . The odd pair is perfect fodder for a quirky romance-drama that harks of ' 90s Bollywood . <p> Bubbly and Danish have a strange karmic connection to intercity travels and trains . The two first meet at a train station where Bubbly mistakes Danish for a coolie ( he was shooting the aforementioned commercial for his real estate brand ) . Bubbly , we learn , is visiting her friend ( Srha Asghar ) in Karachi before she goes back to wed her childhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way . Danish is set to marry his childhood friend as well ( played by Sarish Khan ) , because it makes sense ; they do n't love each other but feel that comfort and familiarity are good enough causes to marry in their case . <p> Soon , Bubbly and Danish meet again on a train , this time on the way to Lahore from Karachi ( there were problems with intercity air travel ) and sparks fly , albeit a bit awkwardly . <p> Rehbra is a quirky romance-drama that is reminiscent of ' 90s Bollywood , and tells an engaging story with a bit of adventure and an abundance of humour <p> Later , another train ride leads the plot to an unanticipated change of direction , when a gang of highwaymen -- dacoits with high morals and bald heads ( it 's their gang 's prerequisite ) -- raid the train and abduct passengers . <p> If films were a reflection of its maker 's ideologies , then Rehbra would be a near-perfect representation of Amin Iqbal -- a veteran television director known for tent-pole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sami Khan and Yumna Zaidi starrer Ishq-i-Laa for Hum TV ) . <p> Rehbra , like Iqbal and his works , is unfussy and easy . It does n't hammer in excessiveness or melodrama -- even when the plot warrants some of it . You get a balanced helping of everything , with just enough details to feel right at home with the characters . <p> The story sets its gaze firmly on both Danish and Bubbly whose actions carry the narrative , for better or worse . The two work quite well as eventual best buds -- both Ahsan and Ayesha have good screen chemistry , given the limitations of the screenplay also written by Iqbal -- but accepting the two as a romantic pair is a bit of a stretch . Scenes , especially when Danish and Bubbly are at the behest of the dacoits , and the interim passage of events before the climax , fail to convince you otherwise . <p> The scenes are there , mind you , as is the ear-catching soundtrack by Seemab Sen ( Wrong No. 2 ) and Imran Ali -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the film -- but one feels , for the most part , that Danish and Bubbly are good friends who share a bit of spark that can eventually blossom into romance ; the way that ' eventually ' comes to pass feels hurried and tacked on . <p> Sohail Sameer , as the Seraiki-speaking head of the gang , does a great job as a multi-layered villain with a humanistic agenda , and his on-screen wife played by Farah Tufail exhibits a much more refined take on love in hardly a minute-long scene . <p> Ahsan Khan -- always the good-looking lead in any film -- has a good handle on Danish , especially in the first-half of the film . Danish , one notices , has a wide-eyed , nearly unblinking sense of wonder whenever he meets Bubbly . It 's a side of life he has n't seen , if you see his reactions . Ayesha , as Bubbly , surprisingly pulls off the ' bubbly ' bit of her character with enthusiasm and consistency ( the film was shot both before and after the Covid-19 pandemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the two leads ) . There are bits of their characterisations late in the film that one can not agree with ( and because of spoilers , one can not talk about ) , but other than that there is not a whole lot one can criticise about Rehbra ( there is the colour-grading but everything else , technically , is in order ) . <p> Amin tells a good story about conventional romance that has a bit of adventure and a lot of quirk and humour ( courtesy of Ayesha 's character ) . It is a tale that one can understand because one has seen these types of films time and again . It is not a rip-off , in case the question pops into anyone 's head , but it is familiar in the way movies tended to be familiar once upon a time . <p> Released by Mandviwalla Entertainment and produced by Saira Afzal , Rehbra also stars Saba Faisal and Ghulam Mohiuddin , and is playing in cinema screens now

@@89871235 <p> As temperatures rise and heatwave alerts intensify in Karachi , air-conditioners , coolers , and fans are switched on and markets for electrical cooling appliances flourish . <p> As researchers studying the impacts of extreme heat in urban Pakistan , we have been exploring what it means to profit from heat , which has become a pervasive and immersive experience for people living and working across South Asia . <p> Even though South Asian bodies are believed to be acclimatised to higher temperatures and humidity levels compared to their counterparts in the Global North , the increasing pace of global warming aided by human-caused climate change , is leading to unprecedented patterns in heat exposure for these populations . <p> Heatwaves have become more frequent , more intense , and last longer than in previous decades . When the temperature exceeds 45 ? , it has already become physiologically impossible for people to continue everyday activities . <p> The main driver of increased heat exposure is a combination of global warming and population growth in already warm and densely built-up urban centres -- our research at the Karachi Urban Lab shows that over the past 60 years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? . This may be an effect of the urban heat island , caused directly by the city 's unchecked expansion , compaction , and densification . <p> Experts suggest that South Asia is the most affected region when it comes to heat stress , and certain populations -- low income , migrants , elderly , homeless , people with underlying conditions , daily wagers -- are disproportionately exposed to the climate-related health effects of urban heat islands and heatwaves . Moreover , the disproportionate increases of heat-related risks can also be attributed to their little or no access to contemporary cooling technologies such as ACs . <h> Raking in the profits <p> How does the demand for cooling technologies open up profit-making opportunities in Pakistan 's largest metropolis ? <p> We have been looking at formal and informal markets for cooling appliances to understand how small-scale businesses play an essential role in delivering affordable , refurbished cooling technologies that are instrumental in shaping the rising demand for cooling in Karachi -- a city of 25 million residents and where approximately 62 per cent live in informal settlements underserved by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooling appliances such as second hand refrigerators , air coolers and ACs , is the cornerstone of livelihoods and profits in Karachi 's largest second-hand market for cooling technologies -- the Jackson Market , established during British colonial rule . Named after Edward Jackson who was the Karachi Port engineer in the late 19th century , Jackson Market is where people from low-to-middle income households go to buy relatively affordable , refurbished ACs . <p> Jackson Market is well-known for supplying ' ship air conditioners ' that are portable devices used in smaller rooms in hostels and offices . These ACs are mostly Japanese manufactured , and were originally installed on ships . They reach the market as scavenged ' scrap ' after ship-breaking processes . But recently , this supply route has shrunk , and such ACs now find their way into Karachi through Afghanistan . <p> Typically , a refurbished 1-ton wall AC sells for Rs15,000 to Rs20,000 , and the price of a portable ship AC ranges from Rs10,000 to Rs12,000 . The ACs are less costly when compared to new , branded ones such as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 1-ton Haier that sells for Rs 50,000 . However , Karachi 's hot and humid weather takes a toll on all types of ACs , whether new or refurbished . <p> A shopkeeper explained : <p> Considering the intense humidity in Karachi , the life of ACs is usually not more than 1.5 years , regardless of the brand and price . An AC that sells for Rs100,000 has a life span that is n't that different from a cheaper , refurbished one . The humidity in Karachi is terrible ; it damages the ACs ' cooling coils . So , whether you buy an AC for Rs100,000 or Rs20,000 , you still need to repair and maintain it regularly . <p> Even though disproportionately hotter and humid cities like Karachi present a challenge for environmentally and economically sustainable cooling technologies , with intensely rising temperatures , cooling is now no longer a luxury but a significant need . <p> Cooling as a necessity leads us to question who has access to cooling in conditions of extreme heat ; a key point that aligns with the Sustainable Development Goal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is critical for space cooling . Access to cooling is a major equity issue . <h> Access to power <p> Nearly 50 million people in Pakistan live without connection to the electricity grid and Pakistan also has some of the world 's worst power outages . Cities like Karachi suffer from prolonged power cuts that last between eight to 12 hours per day . <p> With urban heat islands and the onset of long , recurrent heatwaves , the role of domestic energy services is a prime concern for supporting indoor cooling spaces and mitigating the impacts of extreme heat . There is limited understanding in Pakistan of the ways in which urban households respond to or plan for extreme heat , and consequently how this might create greater demand for the cooling and air conditioning of indoor spaces . <p> The levels of inadequate indoor cooling among households with typically limited incomes , may be a strong deprivation element ; those living in poverty , with inadequate access to electricity , and in housing with poor ventilation and materials and design that may be incompatible with certain cooling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Globally , cooling related energy demand has tripled since 1990 , and the demand for ACs is expected to dramatically increase in developing countries . Approximately 2 billion AC units are now in operation around the world and the demand for cooling has risen at an average pace of 4pc per year since 2000 . This has significant implications for electricity grids . <p> In hotter regions such as South Asia , the use of ACs is set to soar as incomes rise , populations grow , and urban centres continue to expand . However , many households can not afford cooling systems . The ownership of ACs in Pakistan is relatively low : only 13.1pc of urban households own an AC and in the rural context , the share is considerably lower at 2.3pc as shown in Figure 1 . <p> As temperatures rise , cooling equipment vendors and traders see opportunities for business and profits .

People demand ACs especially during heatwaves because they ca n't sleep at night . People are so anxious that they are willing to buy a secondhand AC that has n't yet been fully refurbished . We double the price of every AC during heatwaves . <p> Portable ACs on display in Jackson Market . -- Photo : Karachi Urban Lab <h> Suit your needs <p> Jackson Market offers a wide variety of ACs that meet the requirements of specific kinds of households and buildings , and each type of AC is categorised in terms of its voltage . For instance , a wall unit or window AC is suitable for small rooms . This type of AC is especially popular amongst families and individuals residing in apartment buildings . Most such clients prefer an AC that operates on minimal voltage , and this is due to their reliance on the kunda system -- electricity connection that is secured through informal means . <p> A vendor pointed out : <p> Majority of the customers are from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay rising electricity bills . To survive the heat , they secure electricity connections through the kunda system . These customers specifically request for ACs that function on low voltage and generate low electricity bills of Rs3000 per month . <p> The portable ship ACs are also cheap , but they run on high voltage and generate higher electricity bills of approximately Rs8,000 per month . Knowing that in Karachi we do n't have stable electricity connection and voltage flow , I would n't suggest a portable AC to customers who rely on kunda system . <p> Nearly all the second hand ACs are repaired and customised for new clients . Jackson Market is constantly busy with workers repairing , fixing , and remaking ACs before putting them up for sale . Businessmen employ labourers who clean or vacuum the old ACs ; and skilled technicians perform functional checks and services . ACs that do n't function are separated and the spare parts reused for other mechanical devices . <p> When discussing the process of cleaning an old AC and the materials used , a labourer elaborated : <p> We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and silver spray that protects the metal .

People think water will disable the machine 's motor , but it does n't . <p> The repair work brings back to life the old ACs and adds value to the scrap materials that are identified as non-functioning parts . The vendors call this material electronic junk stock . All the non-usable parts of the ACs -- from the coil and motor to the cards -- are sold to the informal recycling industry at specific rates based on the type of material . <p> For instance , copper ( tamba ) is sold at Rs14,000 per kilogramme , plastic net at 700 per kg , and iron at Rs 95 per kg . These rates are set for the local kabari wallah who recycles the materials . If the material is sold in Karachi 's renowned recycling market -- the Shershah Market , rates increase by at least Rs 20-30 per kg . <p> A big businessman explained : <p> I have electronic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the season ends .

The reactions of all the stakeholders , invariably point out to the hard fact at place in the Pakistani politics that after 75 years , the civil and military elite remains strange ; rather estranged , bedfellows . Surprisingly , the PTI which built its image as an anti-establishment force , did not take much time to announce a ceasefire with the establishment as well as its arch-rivals , the PML(N) and the PPP . The PTI. which boasted of an unparallelled one-page status with the military in fact was the one which was witness to the developing estrangement of the worst kind ; the likesof which in the political history of the PML(N) and PPP can not be located . <p> To recall , the current crisis started with the single press release for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one page between the civil and military and ended a " favourite " government , bringing instead the not-so-favourites .

That has become a regular feature whenever an inning of military rule ends and finally the political rule is restored , many times in name only . The democratic interlude is characterized by constant jockeying for power , which in turn creates mistrust . <h> The way forward is correction , especially in terms of action , not press releases from the institutions which have a record of intervention .

Actually , whenUS President Trump ordered striking the Iranian General in Baghdad in January 2020 , Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in his tweet preferred to mention the COAS incumbent at that time of Pakistan , then the Prime Minister . <p> In the midst of these protocols followed by the external stakeholders ; it has been practically the only period ; during the stint of Democrats in Washington , when under the banner of Kerry Lugar Bill in 2009-2010 , the Obama Administration gave what was due , weightage to the civilian government . Otherwise , it has been military , with whom even the Americans are comfortable to work with . <p> During the period under discussion , the Osama episode once again showed that the two strange bedfellows , the PPP government and the military , were not on the same page . While the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invasion of its enclave , the President of Pakistan , the ceremonial commander in-chief of the Pakistani defence forces and the chairman of the political party at the centre had already sent for publication an article condoning the US strike in Abbottabad . During the same period , the Memogate affair was another point of deep conflict between the PPP and the GHQ . <p> The PML(N) , which got a bitter taste of military coup in 1999 , despite being partners in pressuring the PPP in 1990 and 1994 , too had to be what can be said crops up with the ever-present Khaki shadows . Pakistan was witness to the pitch-dark flypast of PAF jets on 14 August 2014 in the clumsiest manner ; when the polity and society was first held hostage to the mechanics of the establishment favourites , the PTI hordes in Islamabad .

It was only the stand taken by the PPP and the insistence that parliamentary attendance be restored that the " revolutionary " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is history . <p> The ascension of the favourite politician to the post of prime minister was boasted as a time when the one-page doctrine was achieved and the two parties were never or were no more strange bedfellows . However , the gradual turn of events after the start of the third year of this happy marriage soon demonstrated that both the parties were actually ' sleeping with the enemy ' . Again , the follow-up events are current happenings ; which future historians will be in a better position to study and analyze . <p> The reasons for that continued mistrust between the civil and military , which has plagued the Pakistani polity and the economic and strategic planning has been the battle for control of the resources as well as the key decision making . The origins of that mindset emanate from the earlier days of the country , when the politicians from the vanguard party PML , were not in the position to run the country with consensus .

The appointment of Ayub Khan , a serving military officer , as the Defence Minister in an otherwise civilian cabinet was the first misstep in this context . <p> - Advertisement - <p> The military coup in October 1958 , for the time being swung the balance in military favour . However , the biggest fall-out of that arrangement was that while the military aspects and the administrative aspects were presumably dealt with in a superficial manner ; the political aspect was completely ignored . The best example of how that proved costly was the separation of East Pakistan . The Bengali population 's disillusionment with the federation had started but the government due to its pure military nature did not detect the same . <p> One example of that lack of empathy was the 1965 war . While 200 or so jets of all categories were in West Pakistan for the defence of the air space , East Pakistan was left at the mercy of the IAF stationed in West Bengal , Assam , Bihar , and other Indian states surrounding East Pakistan . There were only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eastern flank 's airspace . By the time the dust settled , the East Pakistanis ' anger had crossed the prohibitive limits . Again , the government faced with protests in both the wings of the country could not understand the political demands and dealt with them with an iIron hand approach . The 1971 separation of East Pakistan was the direct result of that approach . <p> The ascension of Bhutto , if one follows the narrative of eminent political analyst Shuja Nawaz , in 1971 was made by the Army under duress ; an act they would not have entertained under normal circumstances . However , Bhutto could not implement his programme as fully as he wanted , to maintain a sort of trust with the Army . Opposed to military pacts with the USA , he continued with the CENTO and SEATO arrangements during his tenure . During the Arab-Israeli conflict of 1973/74 , PAF pilots volunteering for combat were advised to do that on their own , meaning adherence to the above-mentioned pacts . The Zia years ' treatment of Junejo , the Ojrhi camp episode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were shown the door were the period when the mistrust escalated gradually . Lastly , the last six months and the turning against them of those the Army had trained as its allies , evaporated any semblance of any decency . <p> The way forward is correction , especially in terms of action , not press releases from the institutions which have a record of intervention . A country at the shore of economic meltdown can not afford a narrow vision of anyone powerful .

For ease of conversation , let 's call them MBD here . There are multiple factors that have contributed to the emergence of this phenomenon among some Pakistanis living at home or abroad . They have made plenty of observers seem clueless about what shape this anomaly would take next . They let rip at the slightest provocation -- or even without it . Mostly they are instigated by their leaders who are equally clueless and ready to let rip . What they did in Madina on April 28 is just one example of their uncontrollable behaviour that they have become prone to display . <p> MBD is not a new phenomenon ; we have seen such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders is to make such behaviour appear perfectly normal . Some commentators have made comparisons with fascist and Nazi tendencies in Italy and Germany in the first half of the 20th century . We may also recall the Altaf-Hussain times in Karachi , when he unleashed a reign of terror on all who disagreed with him or dared to raise a voice of dissent . <p> The prime span of fascism and Nazism was nearly 25 years , after which their steam was snuffed out . Nearly all followers of these ideologies were mad , bad , and dangerous to know . They wreaked havoc within their homelands and on their own people , and they would have continued with their destructive behaviour for decades to come . Even after an end to their violent extremism , their remnants are still around and reemerge here and there with their fossilized thinking patterns and a potential to erupt any moment . <p> Specific to Pakistan , this intolerance was pioneered by the state itself . A curious and dispassionate reading of history makes facts clear , which Pakistan Studies textbooks tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to blame everything on the state , there is ample evidence that state policies and practices cultivate -- to a great extent -- ideas of self-righteousness and narcissism among common citizens , through education and propaganda . The state loves to nurture birds that fly blind , and this flight leads them to mostly wrong destinations . Authoritarianism or pluralism , democracy or dictatorship , humility or hubris , prejudice or tolerance -- all are there to crush or groom . The state makes most decisions about where to lead the nation . There are bursts of affection for certain personalities that develop personality cults . <p> Does this have anything to do with dogmas , religiosity and sectarianism ? Of course . The more dogmas are propagated , the more intolerant people tend to become . Dogma means a blind faith in unquestionable ideologies and personalities . If there is one ideology you ca n't question , there will soon be more of the same ilk . When you revere a personality at the cost of a more balanced assessment of personal traits , there are greater chances of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It becomes a kind of a crusade for their followers to defend their leader at all costs , no matter how destructive or dumb that person may be . <p> The question is : why does a state nurture or tolerate such mad , bad , and dangerous behaviour ? Perhaps the answer lies in understanding the nature of the state itself . In countries such as Pakistan there is always a cosseted elite embedded in the state itself . This elite comes from diverse sections of society : bureaucrats , capitalists , feudal lords , generals , industrialists , judges , and many more . If they are not from the existing elite , the state co-opts them for its own and their benefit . They are mostly complacent in their own attitudes and want to keep the people engaged in one preoccupation or the other . <p> These elites are safe in their own guarded compounds and their well-defended capital -- or they think so . The country carries on its downward spiral from which it always struggles to emerge . When people are exposed to excessive chauvinism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and xenophobia , they seldom think about their real problems such as illiteracy , unemployment , lack of public healthcare , and shortage of power and water . The elite that composes the state itself , is unaffected by these problems and sits comfortably while the people are fed with personality cults and chant slogans against purported enemies . <p> Gradually , malign forces in society take a deep hold of the people who fail to understand the real conspiracies within -- while believing in imaginary conspiracies from outer lands . It may be Afghanistan , America , India , or even Iran , hatching sinister plans against Pakistan while our own elite is safe and sound ; bunging up nearly all sectors of society from education to health to power to security and water and sanitation , and what not . That 's how the mad , bad , and dangerous behaviour thrives . There are segments of society that pose a lingering threat to the constitution , democracy , financial stability , and overall health of society but the elite in power does not consider them a threat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who may be from civilian or military backgrounds . They offer precise solutions to imprecise challenges . Such leaders master the art of grabbing people 's attention without disabusing them of their false notions . People tend to overlook their leaders ' abusive language , their acerbic tongues with brimstone rhetoric . Once these leaders come to power , they try to stack the country 's institutions with pliant people . They bully political opponents , criticize media outlets that refuse to support the great leader , and curb freedoms of assembly and expression . <p> They develop a mad , bad , and dangerous following that targets even a flicker of resistance . Such people are irrelevant in the broader scheme of things both nationally and internationally but assume an air of importance as if the whole world is conspiring against them . They struggle to become relevant , and while doing so they inflict even more harm to their country internally -- and to its standing externally . Their system of thinking is premised upon a desire to dominate ; this desire underpins nearly all their acts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substance . <p> Then what should the state do ? An immediate solution is legal proceedings against them . But , unless there is a realization that we need to democratize our society as a whole through education and economic opportunities , there is hardly anything that can control this mad , bad , and dangerous to know lot . Democratization does not mean just holding elections ; and modernization is not just reflected in constructing bridges and buildings . What is needed is a democratic outlook that is opposed to authoritarianism ; and a modern education that is not chauvinistic , conservative and sectarian . The state needs to initiate and promote a culture of dialogue in education and politics . <p> Be it with constitutional matters , nationality question , provincial autonomy , or relations with neighbours -- all need a democratic discussion and not MBDs opposed to debate and more interested in eliminating ' enemies ' . This mad , bad , and dangerous attitude engenders hostilities in society ; the state needs to reduce those hostilities . In its attempts to control all policies , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has generated even more hostile forces in society .

Even while engaged in small talk , the discussion normally revolves around women they are in contact with or not in contact with either . Whether she is a colleague , a boss , a fellow student , somebody 's wife , sister , daughter , a stranger or even an elderly grandmother , there is no refrain in spurting out remarks coated with open or subtle vulgarity .

Unable to bear this shame , she , later on , ended her life by drinking rat poison . These examples were just a couple in the myriads of crimes committed and probably being committed right now around the world . On a milder tone , there are cases of harassment on the roads , at workplaces , and in shopping centres , all because women are considered objects and not humans . <p> From primitive ideologies to divine revelations , women occupy a central stage in terms of obligations , restrictions and controversies . <p> Researchers explain this tendency as Sexual Objectification ( SO ) Theory envisaging that " SO occurs when a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separated from her as a person and she is viewed primarily as a physical object of male sexual desire " .

The female population of Pakistan is still wreaking from the effects of the infamous series of laws including Hudood Ordinances and Qanun-e-Shahadat ( Law of Evidence Order ) promulgated in 1979 by a so-called religious dictator , General Zia-ul-Haq that codified women 's status as subordinate , relegating them to an inferior position rendering their testimony to half the weight of a man in certain circumstances .

" The urban upper-middle class , which supports PTI ( Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ) loves to compare Imran Khan with Quaid-e-Azam . It 's a great injustice to elevate Imran Khan to the level of Quaid , whose 40 years of contributions to the sub-continent 's judiciary , legislature and politics are incomparable . They also stand poles apart when it comes to their political views . <p> The current young generation was raised in the post-Zia period . Other than Pakistan Studies , their only other source of information is their leader on a container , which makes them think of him as a new Jinnah . The trend of willingly or unwillingly belittling Jinnah is quite common in Pakistan , even amongst our " progressive " academics who often rely on a shock value to stay relevant on social media instead of being honest . If our " intelligentsia " is behaving that way then we ca n't expect better results from the youth getting their information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just happens to be a very good manipulator . <p> From the very first day as PM , Imran Khan used the infamous slogan of ' Pakistan ka matlab kea -- la ilaha il Allah to stay relevant in politics , even though Jinnah himself condemned this slogan when a person chanted it in front of him during the annual session of Muslim League in 1947 . Jinnah replied , " Neither the Muslim League Working Committee nor I ever passed a resolution ' Pakistan ka matlab kea ' -- you may have used it to catch a few votes . " However , it 's associated with Quaid-e-Azam in our textbooks . <p> The trend of willingly or unwillingly belittling Jinnah is quite common in Pakistan , even among our " progressive " academics . <p> In 1943-44 , some members of the Muslim League brought a resolution , which called for the creation of ' Khilafat-e-Rashida ka nizam ' . Jinnah stopped that resolution from being adopted and did n't let his colleagues propagate the idea of a religious state in his presence . Muslim League was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but if we 're to focus on Jinnah alone then it leaves no room for the state that Imran Khan and his followers have in mind . On 10 August 1947 , Jinnah got oaths altered in Pakistan by omitting words like ' swear ' and ' so help me God ' from them to separate religion and state . For him , the only thing that mattered was competence . In Jinnah 's Pakistan , a non-believer could become the Chief Executive -- without uttering words like ' so help me God ' during an oath -- if elected by the majority . Quaid also stopped people from declaring Islam as a state religion . He appointed a Dalit , Jogendra Nath Mandal as Pakistan 's first Minister of Law and Labour to frame the constitution of Pakistan . <p> These were n't isolated cases either . While Congress was supported by the Islamist parties like Majlis-e-Ahrar and Jamat-e-Islami , Muslim League was in bed with the Hindu parties like the Justice Party of Shudras and the Scheduled Castes Federation of Dalits . The Islamists supported Congress because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Khilafat Movement to become popular through right wing populism , while Jinnah did n't endorse the idea and stayed clear . <p> Shudras and Dalits constituted the majority of the Indian population , and their representatives were allies of the League because of Jinnah 's secularism and Congress ' hostility toward them . Brahmins were less than 5% of an entire population , and they were the ones who dominated Congress and big Indian Enterprises , which prevented others from progressing socially , politically and economically because of complete monopoly and bias . Congress also had a militant wing , Hindu Mahasabha , which followed Hindutva . It was co-founded by Lala Lajpat Rai in 1915 , who was a member of both the Congress and Hindu Mahasabha in 1924 when he called for separate countries for Muslims and Hindus by partitioning Punjab and Bengal in half . This was six years before Iqbal suggested the creation of one large Muslim Province within British India . <p> In the 1940s , a vague ' Pakistan ' demand was raised ; but in reality , until the December of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Congress and living under one federation , provided he was offered something good in exchange , like autonomy for Muslim majority areas and the protection of non-Brahmins in Hindu majority areas . This was the reason why Muslims in the Hindu majority areas also supported the whole movement , and not because ' Pakistan was going to become an exemplary Riyasat-e-Madina ' as Imran Khan claims . <p> However , Congress called the session of the constituent assembly without consulting other stakeholders in the December of 1946 , which led to a deadlock . This deadlock then paved the road for a separate and sovereign Pakistan , which led to the isolation of Muslims in Hindustan . While two new dominions of Pakistan and Hindustan were being created , Congress also called for the sub-division of Punjab and Bengal on religious lines , as suggested by Rai years ago . Despite strong protests from the League , Mountbatten went ahead with the partition of provinces , which caused mass migration and bloodshed . <p> While Jinnah was willing to negotiate on the territorial nature of ' Pakistan ' , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start . He stated that it 'd be a non-theocratic parliamentary democracy based on the principles of social justice , equality and fair play . When Jinnah faced an anti-democracy attitude , he claimed that Islam and its idealism taught Muslims the principles of democracy , social justice and equality centuries ago ; hence , it 'd be inaccurate to call Pakistan anti-Islamic or think that it 'd be in conflict with the principles of Islam . This way , Jinnah tried to convince the Muslims that modern democracy was the only way forward . <p> A similar approach was used by an English Philosopher , John Locke , who is now known as the founder of liberalism and political secularism . In personal life , Locke , unlike Jinnah , was a religious person but politically still secular . He used a verse from the bible to justify secularism . The verse reads , " Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar 's , and unto God the things that are God 's . " Since , Jinnah was inspired by English Liberals like Locke , Gladstone and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democracy among the Muslims . He recalled , " I happened to meet several important English Liberals with whose help I came to understand the doctrine of liberalism . The liberalism of Lord Morley was then in full sway . I grasped that liberalism , which became part of my life . " <p> Unfortunately , these Islamic references are being used out of context ever since Jinnah passed away . If Islamists use it to justify theocracy , then half-informed ' intelligentsia ' uses them to prove that Jinnah was ' inconsistent ' . Jinnah also supported the first wave of feminist movement in the 1890s England ; wanted to lift the ban on interfaith marriages and divorce in 1912 ; emancipated Indian soldiers so they too could become officers ; ended martial race rule in Bengal ; drafted the Child Marriage Restraint Act 1929 ; opposed forced purdah and so on . Jinnah 's mindset and his achievements are too big for a populist leader like Imran Khan ; hence , Jinnah should n't be brought down to his level .

While it appears that the Shahbaz Sharif government has decided to complete its short tenure and the National Assembly and new cabinet may still last its term , the power play of the situation has very much changed and the ball is not in PML-N 's court anymore . In many ways , this decision has left us with a lot more questions than answers , and this is reflected in the fact that two judges of the five-member bench dissented from the majority verdict . Firstly , this is a major precedent that the Court has set -- one which does not find a previous citation on .

Human rights defenders around the world have expressed concerns regarding these developments . It mattered enormously to have somewhere to go , to seek help and to demand justice .

@@91073231 <h> A dangerous new culture <p> Suddenly , initially almost unnoticed by many of us , the culture of politics and with it broader aspects of social life have altered in the country . Much of this appears to stem from the aggressive tactics used by the PTI , particularly the misogynist , offensive language used to lash out at political peers . <p> Whereas bitter opponents on the political landscape at one time dined or chatted together in at least relative harmony , we now have absolute hatred and every effort to push this forward . Young people , who in many cases appear to be especially endeared to Imran Khan and see his style of address as machoistic or perhaps based on the style of film characters appear especially susceptible to picking up on the same vibes and spreading them to the social media , notably Twitter . The fact that thousands of people have apparently been hired by the party to post such messages pushes forward the trend . We have lost all hold on ethics and cultural morality . <p> The fact that Imran Khan himself has led this onslaught makes things even more dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in the 1980s and the those which followed , recalling the 1992 World Cup win to which Imran still refers with surprising frequency , Imran is a hero , the man who brought the country enormous pride on the cricketing field and of course later through his superb work in setting up both the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Hospital and Namal University . But this is where accolades to him have to stop . <p> The language he has used in his most recent speeches , most notably the childish and deeply offensive jibes directed at Maryam Nawaz Sharif as well as many other outbursts simply add to the idea that women can be targeted easily and that directing abusive or scornful language at them , sometimes in the guise of a joke , will do no harm . It does enormous harm . After all , we live in a social setup where women are unequal citizens and have little respect in the eyes of many . When such remarks are made by political leaders , their struggle to gain equal status in society becomes harder and also influences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who gather at the PTI 's volatile rallies . The particularly vulgar language used by some PTI supporters is simply shocking . It is sad the party has not acted against them in any way or distanced themselves from such comments . But then when the leader himself is occupied with demeaning political opponents often using sexist language , what can be expected of his followers ? <p> There has to be a solution . The number of women directly elected to parliament remains extremely low . Political parties need to understand the culture we are creating is extremely dangerous to 50 per cent of the population and nearly 50 per cent of voters . Though sadly fewer women are registered as voters than men , the number is still sizable . Parties then need to commit to giving tickets to a certain percentage of women so that more can enter Parliament directly . At the same time , female MNAs and senators can help by putting out a strong statement against misogyny , regardless of which party they belong to , and condemning incidents in which personal remarks have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shireen Mazari dragged out of her car in what is apparently a 50-year-old case . Their voices must combine on this issue no matter what party they stand with or how they vote . <p> The media too can play a part . It has seen the targeting of some of its most prominent female anchors again notably by the PTI and its leaders . Personalities with the standing of Asma Shirazi have been attacked as have others . This again lowers the status of women and suggests that it is open game to attack them just as it is to use misogynistic remarks to undermine men by suggesting that they are feminine in their characteristics and therefore somehow inferior or unsuited to politics . It is true the culture of using ' jokes ' and sometimes abusive language to target political opponents was begun under Zulfikar Ali Bhutto , who used it as a form of diatribe again and again . But today 's misogynistic culture was not a part of this language of address , where wit was often at the forefront of the remarks made . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including those from her own party , but focused on humour rather than on dragging them down on the basis of personal issues . <p> The culture can not continue . It has to be brought to an end in order to salvage a society where at least 11 cases of rape are reported daily and many more are very likely to occur without being reported or reaching the media . We also have a culture where female students have reported harassment at educational institutions including leading medical colleges . At least one is believed to have committed suicide over the harassment she was subjected to . Many female students and even those in working positions at hospitals , schools or offices fail to report harassment because they fear pressure from families to leave work or social stigma and comments from colleagues of other kinds . <p> The situation is an impossible one . It is the duty of our political leaders to guide us past these obstacles and take us to a better place . The dignified manner in which Maryam Nawaz has taken on the role of leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can achieve . There are of course other examples as well . But we need far more . We need more women entering politics and taking up positions in which they are able to make decisions and influence policy . This is not happening at the present time . Too often , women in parliament seem to play only a token role , usually because they have been placed on the seats assigned for women and brought in by relatives or party leaders , leaving them no real space to build their own opinions and their own politics . The situation continues to take increasingly ugly turns . There is no evidence that leaders are ready to apologize for their comments and Imran has certainly not apologized to Maryam Nawaz . This is a dangerous precedent and we believe it will grow worse unless steps are taken to somehow bring it under check .

Even coeducational institutions are often subject to strict moral and dress policing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the administration itself . <p> Inappropriate language and behaviour , harassment , and predatory behaviour ( mostly by men ) remains rampant and mostly unaddressed in workplaces . All the gender frameworks in the world to bring more women into education and the workforce do not mean much if workplaces remain as hostile to women and devoid of accountability for men as they are today . Clearly , the trauma of harassment in the workplace has a psychological cost , but unsafe , unwelcoming workplaces also exact an economic cost . For example , while close to two-thirds of medical students in Pakistan today are women , that is not reflected in the number of women that go on to practice medicine and a big reason for that is the hostile work environment they encounter . <p> For example , a young woman I worked with called me and asked if the WhatsApp messages she received from a very senior bureaucrat were typical of the way he talks to everyone . Without being asked , he had been telling her about his gym routine , commenting on her display picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hers , perhaps as a crude attempt to elicit her marital status . It is very easy to see how such behaviour from a man occupying a high public office , especially towards a young woman , would leave her split between feeling highly uncomfortable and asking herself whether she should react to put a stop to it lest it may cause issues for her employer on whose behalf she was working with that official . <p> In another instance , an owner of a private school told me about her interaction with a public official who , after interacting with her for official business , sent her a disappearing WhatsApp message inviting her to meet him outside of work . Since the message was fleeting , she could not even take a screenshot of it . <p> Another woman received LinkedIn messages from a very senior bureaucrat she had once officially interacted with , telling her that the colour of her dress in her display picture was ' becoming on her ' . <p> On numerous other occasions , women I have worked with had to regularly endure comments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were asked their age , marital status , received unsolicited and irrelevant late night WhatsApp messages or inappropriate memes or songs when their relationship could not even be characterized as friendly colleagues . It is inconceivable that in this day and age such people still need to be told that this constitutes unprofessional and inappropriate behaviour . While I remain reluctant to apply this litmus test , I have no doubt that such men would immediately recognize their own behaviour as crossing the line if someone else was inflicting it on women of their own family . <p> What to do ? A few days ago , my kid started her first summer job in retail . One of the things she was taught as part of her training was how to use the store 's ladder , which irked her a little ( " Do they think I am an idiot ? " ) . I had to explain that training her to climb a ladder was as much for her benefit as for the store 's -- if , God forbid , she ever gets into an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of blame ( " The employee was properly trained in the safe use of the ladder in her orientation " ) . <p> Pakistan 's ' Protection against Harassment of Women at the Workplace Act ' and its implementation is still far from perfect and still leaves several questions and gray areas . However , one thing that it does is give employers , both public and private , responsibility for the workplace environment they create . <p> The route to legal restitution remains a difficult one . As some recent high-profile public cases have shown us , even after recent legislation , it can involve years of court appearances , counter challenges of defamation , etc . Only a small segment of society enjoys the resources and family support necessary to see such legal challenges through . Furthermore , legal challenges of workplace harassment are dueled out between the harasser and the harassed -- the employer who created the work environment often remains out of the fight . <p> We need to raise the financial and reputational cost of inaction of institutions and private organizations high enough that employers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am not aware of any significant number of cases that have worked their way through the legal system yet in which survivors of ( workplace ) harassment have been able to hold their employers responsible for their part in creating a hostile work environment . One hopes that it will only be a matter of time that sufficient legal precedents are established which will make it too expensive for employers to ignore or sweep such incidents under the rug . For this reason , employers would do well to get ahead of the curve . <p> As a first step , employers could institute mandatory training for employees that explicitly informs employees on the bounds of acceptable office behaviour and a common understanding of what constitutes harassment and inappropriate behaviour , something that has been common practice around the world for decades . In that regard , to my understanding , employers are not restricted to narrow definitions of bad conduct laid down in the law but may demand adherence to a higher standard of their employees , one that is in line with the employer 's stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are doing . However , such workplace training disposes of the plea of innocence by way of ignorance . If your workplace does not have workplace harassment training yet , demand them ; if you are in a position of influence , institute them . 
@@92063238 <h> In the fog of forgetfulness <p> One more time , a favourite quote : " The struggle of man against power is memory 's struggle against forgetting " . And this time , I would try to delve a little deeper into the message that Milan Kundera had intended in his novel , ' The Book of Laughter and Forgetting ' . <p> My reason for invoking this quote is that on July 5 this year , on Tuesday , it was the forty-fifth anniversary of Gen Ziaul Haq 's coup against the first elected prime minister of Pakistan , Zulfikar Ali Bhutto . Though surely there were some voices in the media that recalled a seminal moment in Pakistan 's history , it was hard to dispel the impression that we are continuing to lose our struggle against forgetting . <p> We may want to suppress unpleasant memories in our personal lives but when this exertion is wilful and compulsive , the results are detrimental to our mental health and our capacity for rational thinking . It would be the same for nations -- and Pakistan is a prime example of what becomes of a nation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not pay heed to its own history . <p> Besides , our rulers have constantly made an effort to rewrite , even reinvent , the history of the making of Pakistan and its evolution across the past decades . One obvious example is our collective loss of memory of the events of 1971 . It was in the same continuity that the long , dark night of Zia 's martial law descended on this land and changed it to an extent that it is now not easy to decide whether it is Jinnah 's Pakistan or Zia 's . <p> Look around carefully at what is happening to us at this time , with all its urgency and unease , and you will find deep shadows of Zia 's ideological legacy . His Islamization project remains undaunted -- and undented . And yet , at the same time , Pakistani politics ' almost immortal yearning for a populist leader like Bhutto has not diminished . <p> Incidentally , Imran Khan recalled the July 5 , 1977 coup in his speech on Tuesday through a video link . He compared himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the behest of the United States . But the irony here is that Imran Khan is more a disciple of Zia than a student of Bhutto 's politics . He holds Zia 's ideological torch and repeatedly summons the " Pakistan ka matlab kya " slogan that was never raised by Jinnah 's Muslim League . Then , there is this promise of following in the traditions of the state of Madina . <p> But neither Imran Khan nor other leading politicians betray any insight into the history of Pakistan and what we can learn from this journey of a nation that has now fallen behind Bangladesh in nearly all areas of social and economic development . <p> Unlike July 5 and December 16 , we do observe certain anniversaries with so much fanfare , such as August 14 and March 23 . Next month 's Independence Day is so very special because it will be the landmark 75th anniversary of the creation of Pakistan . And yes , there is also the Defence of Pakistan Day on September 6 . <p> Still , there are no serious and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What we have are official narratives that leave out many essential elements of how historical realities are assessed and interpreted . It is in this perspective that I have to return to Milan Kundera and refer to some ideas that are part of a novel that considers the nature of forgetting as it occurs in history , politics and life in general . <p> One very perceptive comment is that the rulers , mainly autocratic rulers , want to be the masters of the future only for the power to change the past . In other words , owning the past is power for the future . Kundera , a Czech writer who went into exile in France in 1975 , spends a lot of time talking about how the destruction of a culture or people happens when its past -- history , language , rituals -- is somehow erased . By the way , the novel tells a story of how this happens at a personal level . <p> Kundera said that if you take a look at any political campaign , you will notice that there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power to dictate how we move forward and how we create ourselves as people or as a nation . <p> Consider how a military dictator of Pakistan sought to erase so many pronouncements of the Founder of the Nation -- and succeeded in his designs to a considerable extent . It is now possible for a leader like Imran Khan to take a certain ' matlab ' of Pakistan for granted . Meanwhile , the small liberal faction of our society continues its struggle to remember a speech made on August 11 , 1947 . <p> One tragedy is that the time when Ziaul Haq was presiding over the destiny of this country is fast receding from living memory . We are such a young country , though immensely populous , that not more than five per cent of those alive now would be adults during Zia 's rule and , hopefully , able to bear witness to that time of infamy . <p> But living memory can only go that far . History lives in other forms and primarily it is taught in educational institutions and preserved in museums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and guides the nation 's way forward . <p> However , the situation in Pakistan seems exceptional . History , as a discipline , is by and large the missing link in the academic structure of our universities . First , the history departments were bifurcated into Islamic Studies and General History and then the General History departments started to expire . <p> To conclude , one fact . In a conversation on this subject , Dr Syed Jaffar Ahmed , our authority on Pakistan studies , told me that in a survey of 250 colleges , he found that only three -- only three -- had general history departments with just four lecturers between them . The silver lining : one of the four lecturers was said to be excellent . <p> The writer is a senior journalist . He can be reached at : **27;468;TOOLONG 
@@92063239 <h> A short ( recent ) history of interest rates <p> An interest rate is simply the price of money . Like other goods or services , as the demand for a particular good or service increases the price of that good or service increases , assuming supply remains unchanged . Similarly , as demand for money increases , its price also increases , which is essentially the interest rate . <p> But why is the demand for money increasing ? In the case of Pakistan , at least for the last 12 years , the largest borrower in the country is the government itself . The demand for money largely stems from the government , which keeps on borrowing more to plug its deficits . But why is the government borrowing more ? It is borrowing because its expenses continue to increase , while it is unable to generate sufficient revenues to meet those expenses -- and it 's also easier to borrow without any concern for cost , rather than undertaking difficult , and incisive structural reforms . <p> So , why ca n't we increase the supply of money ? We have done this time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hyperinflationary scenario . As the supply of money increases , eventually that surplus money gets into the hands of people , whether that is through higher salaries , direct cash payments , untargeted and badly designed subsidies , or through subsidized loans to rent seekers . The excess supply of money flushes the system , and everyone now has relatively more money . <p> What happens when people have more money ? They start demanding more goods and services , which means the price of those goods and services starts increasing . This results in runaway inflation as excess supply of money is available for a finite number of goods and services in the economy , which bids up the price of the available goods and services . As the number of finite goods in an economy is restricted , the demand for imported goods increases , which puts a pressure on the local currency resulting in its depreciation , and further fueling inflation . The resultant inflation erodes the real value of money as households and businesses alike scamper to preserve value , eventually converting into a more stable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the economy . We can print more money , but we ca n't print megawatts , any other tangible goods , and so on . <p> In essence we can either raise interest rates today , or the government can be more fiscally prudent in managing its deficits , rather than being perpetually reliant on borrowing to fund its deficits . The central bank recently increased the benchmark policy rate to 15 per cent , converging to market interest rate at the same level , which is in its highest range in more than 20 years . Following the boom-bust pattern of the economy , interest rates in Pakistan also fluctuate fairly rapidly . Within a span of 30 months , we have gone from 13.9 per cent in July 2019 , to 15 per cent in July 2022 , while reaching a low of 7.2 per cent in August 2020 . <p> Since the start of the current century , interest rates reached a bottom of three per cent in the early 2000s -- only to revert back to double digits as the global financial crisis took root @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Pakistan has seen more than half dozen interest rate cycles signifying the volatility , making it difficult for businesses and households alike to manage savings , and inflation expectations . <p> Such volatility points towards a structural weakness of the economy where inflation expectations are anchored at a considerably higher level , in the range of 7-8 per cent on a long-term basis . As the inflation target remains high , so does the overall level of interest rate in the economy . For the sake of argument , such high levels of interest rates should ideally encourage more savings , but in the absence of formal savings mechanisms , most saving is done outside formal financial institutions , and in the informal economy through parking the same in real estate , gold , or other tangible assets . <p> Pakistan has one of the lowest savings rate among peer economies , and that is largely due to reallocation of capital to the informal economy , which results in parking of capital in unproductive areas of the economy , which may create paper wealth , but is not able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income -- all critical components for sustainable growth .

A coordinated fiscal policy is also critical in ensuring that optimal outcomes for the economy can be generated . As the largest borrower , the government needs to put its house in order if it wants lower interest rates in the economy , and that can only be done through long pending structural reforms . <p> In the absence of any reforms , and any serious efforts in expanding revenue sources , the future of interest rates will mimic history -- with greater volatility in interest rates , and greater frequency of boom-bust cycles .

Hate , stigmatisation , racism , discrimination at workplaces , public places , in political spheres are some of the common things faced by Muslims all around the globe . It rests in mindsets of people and is reflected through their actions and behaviour that include violence , hate speech , burning and vandalising of religious places , abusing women wearing hijab , insulting the Holy Quran , Holy Prophets and sacred symbols of Islam . It also encompasses verbal and physical threats , discrimination in education employment , housing or access to goods and services . <p> In various parts of the world , islamophobia has been introduced as an important area of concern especially in those countries where Muslims are in a minority . According to some journalists the incident that become the base of islamophobia 's birth was Ayatollah Khomeini 's fatwa of 1989 inciting to murder the British Indian writer Salman Rushdie , the author of The Satanic Verses .

Every country wants peace and prosperity but when it comes to religious dignity its a responsibility for everyone to raise their voices against the wrong . <p> The anti-Muslim invasion of Palestine , and Jammu and Kashmir , have always been neglected by the Western countries . They always talk about human rights and freedom but have been equally involved in Muslim genocide that never comes to an end . The USA facilitating Israel for its military invasion in Palestine .

In this video , a young man was in a shooting range and targeting clay pots with an AK-47 . I was told he was the husband of the then prime minister Benazir Bhutto ( Asif Ali Zardari who served the country thereafter as President ) and this video was some 10 years older and Asif Ali Zardari was getting training from enemies of Pakistan for subverting peace in the country . <p> When I asked my host why he was showing this 10-year-old video to me , he said that the public must know what kind of people were ruling the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was my national duty to tell people about his background through my writings . When he was talking to me I had already understood that it was a " fake video " but there was no use asking questions about the credibility of this video that could have been recorded in a desert area of Sindh or on his own farmland where this young man could do his shooting practice . How could you ask a question about the credibility of a planted material from the person who is planting it on you ? After a brief further gapshup I came out of his office and erased the entire conversation from my perception . Time passed away and he never asked me about any article that I ever wrote . <p> In 1994 , I was invited by a friend who was a police official in Lahore while I was doing crime reporting .

My meeting was arranged with that lady who claimed she was ganged raped by Mr Ch . I asked her some questions and could not find a sequence in her story . She covered her face in the meeting so I did not know her real name nor could recognize her face . <p> When I came out of the place where my meeting was arranged , I told my police officer friend that he should produce this woman with her face covered for a press conference because I did not find her story true or even having half-truth , and told him I would not do a story .

This is the reason that the officer and hybrid journalists ( mostly now anchors ) are ruthlessly exposed when five or ten anchors are reading line to line the same " credible information " sitting at different TV screens .

CJ please do not ridicule the JCP and your nominees by contravening the Constitution . Restricting the JCP to consider only the CJ 's pre-selected nominees is inappropriate . The JCP deserves to be treated with respect and consideration by its Chairman , " implored the justice . <p> " The CJ admits to having acted discriminatingly as he says that he decided to consider only a certain number of judges , and this he did arbitrarily .

He is being called upon to choose his own successor . This is unconstitutional . Pakistan is not a kingdom of yore in which kings decided their successors . If this is permitted then the CJ may next call a meeting of the JCP to fill-in ' anticipated vacancies ' that will occur in respect of all the judges of the SC , including those retiring after him . Nominating or appointing judges prior to their retirement is a major breach of the Constitution . Pakistan is to be governed according to the Constitution and not as per the desire or wish of the CJ " . <p> " SC has repeatedly held that those decisions which have a long-term effect must not be made by one just prior to retirement . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alam Miankhel gracefully declined to recommend any judge for appointment close to his retirement . Hon'ble Justice Sajjad Ali Shah remains a judge for only two weeks more yet has been burdened to recommend five judges who will remain in office for years , " he said . <p> " The matter of appointing judges to the superior courts requires utmost care and due deliberation as it is a matter of extreme delicacy . CJ please do not ridicule the JCP and your nominees by contravening the Constitution . Restricting the JCP to consider only the CJ 's pre-selected nominees is inappropriate . The JCP deserves to be treated with respect and consideration by its Chairman , " he furthered . <p> Justice Isa also said that in the JCP meeting held on June 28 , " everyone , except the CJ and the Hon'ble Justice Ijazul Ahsan , voted to postpone the meeting as there was no justification to call it during the gazetted summer vacations and as the senior most judge was on sanctioned annual leave . It was also noted that for the first time ever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the antecedents or the competence gauging committees of the JCP . Therefore , calling yet another JCP meeting when all the same reasons , on the basis of which earlier meetings were postponed , still subsist and there is the added reason of the Attorney-General having recently been operated upon , is inexplicable . " <p> " I most respectfully submit that the CJ can not reject decisions of the JCP . In calling another meeting during notified-gazetted vacations , when some members are on annual leave , and at a time when the Attorney-General is recovering from the second surgery he has recently undergone , is unjustified . The democratically taken decision by the JCP not to meet in such circumstances must be abided by . Democracy is the bedrock of the Constitution and the basis on which Pakistan came into existence . " <p> " When the CJ also knows that in a few days the senior puisne judge returns to Pakistan ( insh'Allah on 13 August 2022 ) then why ca n't he wait for a few more days ? Not to have JCP meetings for months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puisne judge is on sanctioned annual leave suggests that the CJ does not want him to be physically participate , which is illegal and unconstitutional . Incidentally , I worked throughout the winter vacations , and generally the last to leave work late in the evening and did not leave a single pending decision nor left any ' short order ' awaiting provision of detailed reasons . " <p> " The CJ did not schedule meetings when the vacancies in the SC occurred but all of a sudden wants to make wholescale appointments to the SC hurriedly . To appoint five judges means more than a third of the SC , which the CJ wants to pack during notified-gazetted vacations , and by avoiding the participation of all members , " said Justice Isa . <p> COMMENTS <p> Replying to X <p> Saved !

It was the last time we gazed at each other while listening to our favourite parts of the song . It was the last time a melody echoed in Room 411 of Atia Hospital . Two days later , my mother passed away . I could say the song eased my mother into her final , peaceful sleep . Now that Nayyara ji is no more , I feel as though I have lost the deepest connection I had with my mother since it was Nayyara Ji 's songs that I used to remember her by . <p> I was 11 years old when I heard my mother humming the tunes of ' Roothay Ho Tum ' for the first time . Being an inquisitive kid , I asked her what the words meant , to which she smiled and began explaining to me the entire philosophy of the song , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pacify her beloved through her submissive attitude and promises of perpetual love .

" her gleaming eyes would say . <p> As I grew older , I started to better understand the lyrics of Nayyara Ji 's songs .

While the melody of the song tugged at my heartstrings , the lyrics seemed extremely relatable and profound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Later , I asked mom whether she had heard it as I wanted to overwhelm her with my newly-developed taste for good music but to my disappointment , she already had . <p> One day , we were discussing one of the songs by Nayyara Ji when my mother revealed that she was not a formally trained singer , yet was one of the best vocalists we have . This piqued my interest and I decided to know more about her .

Once , during an annual gala dinner , her teachers and class fellows asked her to sing on the college 's stage , she told Hashmi , and she crooned a bhajan by Lata Mangeshkar -- ' Jo Tum Todo Piya ' from Jhanak Jhanak Payal Baaje . This got her the attention of Islamia College 's Professor Asrar Ahmad who had a knack for good music . He recognised her talent and encouraged her to pursue it . <p> " Asrar sahab ne mujhe apne paas bulaya or kaha , mera naam Asrar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bohat acha gaati hain , ap is fun ko zaya mat kijiyega Asrar sahab called me to him and said , ' my name is Asrar and I want to inform you that you sing really well and you must not waste your talent , " she recalled . <p> He later introduced her to Radio Pakistan where she recorded her first track . However , she made her public debut with films likeGharana ( 1973 ) and Tansen .

But it did n't come easy . Being a South Asian woman , she had to work harder to simultaneously meet the expectations of her fans and family . <p> She spoke about how difficult it was for her to maintain a work-life balance , being a wife and a mother . Amidst household responsibilities and taking care of her children , she would n't get much time to do riyaaz ( a systematic way of practicing music to hone the musicality of one 's voice ) . <p> " I know what I have been through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ samna karna parta hai .

" <p> Nayyara ji 's songs introduced me to good poetry and instilled a love for good music into someone as badzauq ( somebody with unrefined tastes ) as me . I still remember when I first heard ' Ay Jazba-e-Dil ' , there was one line in the song that stuck with me . It was " Us waqt mujhe bhatka dena jab samne manzil ajaye But do let me go astray , when the destination is but a step away " . <p> This one-liner taught me that " manzil " ( destination ) is a facade , because in reality , we never have one destination .

@@93056234 <h> The cost of harangue outside safe confines of parliament <p> Lawmakers get a minimum of 130 days in a year to speak their heart out on the floor of parliament . Yet , they frequently abandon the prestigious , top constitutional forum and manage to draw courts ' ire with their reckless statements given in public places that lack immunity . <p> Parliament shields politicians from the outside fury to a great extent . The courts are usually reluctant to ' foray into ' the insulated hallowed halls . <p> However , the lawmakers , seemingly loath to speak within the ' safer confines ' , often take matters before large gatherings to air their opinions . This has often landed them in legal troubles . <p> A recent report of the Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency ( PILDAT ) revealed that ex-premier Imran Khan attended only one National Assembly sitting in the 4th parliamentary year while he held the office of the prime minister , adding that ex-prime minister attended a total of 34 or 11% sittings of the 15th National Assembly . <p> The PILDAT report states that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has attended only eight out of 43 or only 19% of sittings of the National Assembly , where PILDAT said the cost of a working day of the 15th National Assembly stood at Rs64.15 million . <p> Abandoning parliament has proved to be a costly practice -- both financially and politically -- for different politicians belonging to different political parties in the past as they faced contempt of court proceedings and got disqualified . <p> Imran Khan 's recent speech criticising a sitting judge and the Inspector General of Police has also landed him in hot waters . Yet he -- and other politicians -- prefers speaking before the public than in parliament . <p> " Public power is the only thing that impresses the opponents as well as the power centres that be in the country , " PILDAT 's president Ahmed Bilal Mehboob said , saying speeches in the assembly provide immunity but do n't serve the actual purpose of showing the strength every now and then . <p> " Opponents and the centres of powers in the country are impressed by the public , " the PILDAT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should n't use the strength that he has over others . " <p> Mehboob said that Imran has a huge public following and people gather whenever he gives a call for a rally . From this , he said , Imran draws great strength to impress the rivals and the power centres . <p> Through public rallies , Mehboob said , Imran gives a message that having public support is extraordinary , and this show of strength adds weight to his message and narrative . <p> Also , he said that parliamentary immunity was not unlimited as the Constitution bars lawmakers from discussing the conduct of the judges of the high courts and the Supreme Court . <p> He referred to Article 68 of the Constitution ( restriction on the discussion in Majlis-e-Shoora Parliament ) , which states that " No discussion shall take place in Majlis-e-Shoora ( Parliament ) with respect to the conduct of any Judge of the Supreme Court or of a High Court in the discharge of his duties . " <p> Article 69 ( Courts not to inquire into proceedings of parliament ) states : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall not be called in question on the ground of any irregularity of procedure " and " ( 2 ) no officer or member of parliament in whom powers are vested by or under the Constitution for regulating procedure or the conduct of business , or for maintaining order in parliament , shall be subject to the jurisdiction of any court in respect of the exercise by him of those powers . " <p> Referring to massive public support for PTI , Mehboob said that power shows give strength but Imran should carefully choose words or sentences as immunity ends at parliament . He said Imran was careless in naming a sitting judge and others in a public gathering , saying he could have conveyed the message while being more careful in selecting words and sentences . <p> Advocate Imran Shafique said that lawmakers should keep in mind that the speeches made outside parliament have legal consequences , saying either they should carefully convey their message to the masses in the public gathering or choose the forum which gives them immunity . <p> Apart from judges ' conduct , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the sun , saying they can also discuss and criticise courts ' judgements as the Constitution only puts a restriction on discussing the conduct of the higher judiciary 's judges but not their professional or legal matters . " They have the power to amend the constitution ; what else they need , " he said . <p> Shafique , however , regretted that it was an insult to parliament that the lawmakers either do not attend the sessions or utter a single word as revealed by the recent PILDAT report . <p> The report said that Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari was the most vocal MNA during the tenure of the PTI government ( three years and eight months ) while 174 MNAs ( 50.88% ) did not speak at all . <p> He said that the speaker has the right to restrict or expunge remarks from the speeches but still the legislators have parliamentary immunity and they can express their views with complete freedom . <p> He recalled that even the chief justice of Pakistan has given remarks that PTI should play its role in the parliament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play their due role and strengthen parliament instead of just using it as a ladder . <p> COMMENTS <p> Replying to X <p> Saved !

His songs gyrations and style of grooving revolutionized the culture and transfigured him into an icon to swoon over . <p> Hailing from Memphis , Tennessee , USA in 1935 Elvis was raised among the black African American community in the days when they were marginalized in the white dominant society . Elvin learned the ways of how Black singers produced music and how they sang their way into the hearts of the people . <p> Elvis soon became the great Elvis Presley . He fell in love , produced record breaking albums , and toured the entire USA .

Maybe because he 's Tom Hanks with a charisma very hard to ignore . At time his character would remind you of the mean bad old cartoonish fat villains one would see in animated children 's series . <p> When Colonel founds Elvis , he capitalizes on his talent and his skills for music . Elvis 's life turns plunges into stardom as he struggles with a number of negativity and mental and personal struggles . <p> What Colonel hides from that glowing and flamboyant stardom of Elvis which the Colonel fuels his greed and selfishness that makes him make unhealthy decisions for the singer .

Tom Hanks once again proves of how much diversity he 's prepared to depict and embrace through adopting the most extreme roles . <p> Making a biopic on Elvis was overall an arduous challenge until Baz Luhrmann took the task and even further until he decided to cast Austin Butler as Elvis himself . Whatever happens after it is phenomenal . This takes me to the second part of the movie . <p> If anyone could play Elvis in Hollywood , it would be Austin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Austin literally proved in all his prowess and talent as he donned on glittering performing suits and took the helmed of that wired mic .

His speaking style also resembles Elvis very much . I recommend watching his interview on the Jimmy Fallon Show . <p> Baz Luhrmann 's trademark elements are quite evident . Touch of maximalism and a fast-paced editing makes the movie a bit easy to digest . The pop and rock theme sets naturally on the screenplay and the direction .

He creates this dramatic rapture when little Elvis is peeking through broken wooden piece of a dance bar . The lust for music blows him away as he identifies a black man avidly doing his thing with the guitar and his vocals . <p> When the movie negative aspects are called into question by the professional critics , the stunning performance of the lead role principally heals in curtaining it . <p> For some , the film is quite fast paced , to an extent that even 10 min break would have you miss a plenty of it unless you 're watching it on an OTT .

@@93757230 <p> Optimism -- or the idea that our inherent ability to overcome problems is greater than the chance our problems overcome us -- is perhaps the most prevalent and indefatigable of all imaginative viruses to infect humans . It lies at the root of the greatest disasters in history and has seriously compromised humanity 's response to the global ecological catastrophe . <p> Optimists are generally willing to give human beings the benefit of the doubt or simply invent the doubt necessary to continue giving themselves and others like them a pass . The most diehard of this lot , no matter how bad things get , will remain true to the notion advanced by Professor Pangloss in Voltaire 's Candide that we live " in the best of all possible worlds . " <p> What makes Pangloss remarkable is his ability to explain away all the terrible things that happen to Candide ( the hero ) as being somehow for the best . The more disasters befall Candide , the more elaborate Pangloss becomes in his rationalisations . <p> The sources of our optimism are many , but three , in particular , merit mention . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our animal brains to react to difficulties unless they are immediate . Over millions of years , humans evolved to excel at responding to immediate dangers with a range of xenophobic and cooperative responses hardwired into them . <p> In a series of seven essays written in 2018 and 2019 and ranging across history , philosophy , science and literature , but published only recently in the e-book Downfall : Lessons For Our Final Century , historian Ilhan Niaz argues that modern civilisation , as it is presently understood , will likely end between 2030 and 2100 . He marshals mounting evidence that the damage already done to the world is so great that a " crisis of habitability " is inevitable . Eos presents here , with due permission , one of the essays from the book ... <p> Just think of how your mind focuses on any strange sound or how tribal we are in our social life with multiple layers of in-groups and out-groups requiring " us " to work together against " them " . At the same time , absent an immediate threat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all else . <p> The second is rooted in our imagination and its effects on our ability to understand the causes of phenomena around us . As the exercise of reason requires effort and often produces unpleasant effects , human beings are vulnerable to any assertion of certainty . Historically , the easiest way to be sure about things is to imagine an explanation or attribute causes to supernatural forces and repeat it endlessly . <p> According to the 18th century Italian philosopher Giambattista Vico , the exercise of this imaginative faculty was an important binding force in early civilisations . The xenophobic and cooperative tendencies rooted in our biology found expression in what Vico called " poetic wisdom " , whereby cooperation on a large scale to placate or fight against the supernatural forces responsible for natural processes that often harmed humans emerged . <p> It also meant that humans who believed in a different set of deities could be identified as outsiders . But the greatest asset of poetic wisdom was its infinite elasticity in explaining human suffering and the many calamities that afflicted people at the individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superstitions , dharma , karma , modern wellness tropes and a variety of other ideas brilliantly dissected by Francis Wheen in How Mumbo Jumbo Conquered the World help people stay hopeful . Statements that celebrate as a " miracle " the survival of one person out of scores or hundreds in an accident or rags-to-riches stories are classical instances of such thinking . <p> The third source of optimism is self-centeredness . Over the past 300 years , as traditional ideas have become less appealing , materialism and consumerism have provided secular means of helping us stay hopeful . Global elites are particularly fierce advocates of material optimism , while those who have succeeded enough in terms of conventional bourgeois standards also strongly identify with this type of thinking . <p> For the globalised classes , their privileges and prosperity encourage them to rationalise it as being a desirable outcome for all , with the promise held out that everyone could have a Swiss standard of living .

Our optimism is built on the solid foundations of biology , ideology , and self-absorption . It is no surprise that optimistic thinking has produced disastrous consequences throughout history . <p> One does not have to go very far back to find instances of optimism leading to catastrophic miscalculations . The 20th century began with the drift to the First World War -- a conflict that claimed 20 million lives directly and at least an additional 20-30 million lives indirectly . Amongst the most critical causes of the conflict was the idea that war would be won swiftly and cheaply , enabling an advantageous reset of the global pecking order . Every great power that entered the war was convinced that victory was one campaign away . <p> Hope for victory <p> Had the rulers of Europe been pessimists and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prey to militarist and nationalist fantasies . In spite of the enormous trauma endured by the participants in the First World War , most retained a resolutely optimistic outlook on the future . This optimism was the result of revolutions in Russia , Italy and Germany , which brought to power left-wing and right-wing utopians . <p> In the United States , the return of the country to isolationism represented the triumph of the hope that the world would sort itself out and that , even if it did not , the great oceans would protect the American homeland . In Britain and France , the nominal victors of the First World War , a pacifist fantasy took hold of public discourse -- one that led to the appeasement of fascism while it was militarily weak . <p> This pacifism also led to demoralising concessions , once it became apparent that Germany had rearmed and was ready for a rematch . In Japan , the decline of European colonial empires and the return of the United States to isolation led to the articulation of an imperial vision for Asia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of the continent would thrive under Japanese tutelage . The bill for these various shades of optimistic thinking came due in the form of a global conflict that dwarfed the First World War and raged in China from 1931 to 1945 and in the rest of the world from 1939 to 1945 , killing 60-70 million , and injuring or displacing many times that number . <p> " Men from shortsightedness frequently seek their own advantage in what is harmful to them : how much the more must they err in regard to others . " -- Akbar the Great ( Mughal Emperor , r. 1556-1605 ) <p> The trouble is that , until the Japanese bombs fell on Pearl Harbour , most Americans genuinely believed that they could wait out the World War .

While optimism fuelled by ideological or popular conviction led to the greatest disasters of the first half of the 20th century , the relative peace that descended on the world post-1945 led to the emergence of an even more lethal variant of optimism . <p> After 1945 , elites and peoples of all ideologies , and at all developmental levels , embraced materialistic optimism .

But what was never really questioned was the logic of infinite growth . <p> The result was that , since 1945 , all of the nations stopped waging the kind of total wars that had characterised the first half of the 20th century .

For many in the West , the sense is that , even if a few billion peasants and slum dwellers in the Global South perish as a result of environmental collapse , the global metropolis will be able to employ its accumulated wealth and technology to continue to thrive behind hard borders . <p> They are prepared to make concessions to the public conscience , such as declaring environmental emergencies or promising to achieve net-zero GHG emissions by 2050 , or , as the Shell CEO recently advised , encouraging people to eat seasonally . <p> But while these apparent victories are handed out to the environmental lobby , the United Kingdom , for instance , has cut subsidies for solar power , while British Petroleum continues to send out rigs to drill for oil and gas . <p> Third world globalists might actually live better than their first world equivalents ... Consequently , they are just as vulnerable to the delusion that , when environmental collapse strikes , it will not affect them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they can flee to the West . <p> Within developing countries , the spike in global inequality has benefited elites tremendously , and there is widespread contempt for the poor , reinforced by a variety of caste , communal and tribal identities . The " Globish " elite of the developing world feels closer to its metropolitan counterparts when it comes to seeing the great mass of the Asian , African and Latin American poor as surplus humans and the remaining resources of their homelands as means to get even richer often in cahoots with international capital . <p> Third world globalists might actually live better than their first world equivalents , with the former living in air-conditioned comfort in gated communities with a large underclass to provide them with lots of domestic help . Consequently , they are just as vulnerable to the delusion that , when environmental collapse strikes , it will not affect them , or think that , if things get really bad , they can flee to the West . <p> Rich get richer ... <p> Unwilling to change their behaviour or even limit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith in the human ability to find a technical solution to the multifaceted environmental crisis . Perhaps there will soon be plastic-eating microbes that will clean up our land and oceans ; a massive cloning program to restore global biodiversity ; carbon-capture technology to reverse global warming ; a new global breadbasket will emerge in Siberia and the Arctic to keep humanity fed ; AI Artificial Intelligence will save the day by making everything more efficient ; humans will become an interplanetary species . <p> Of course , even a little logical thinking about any of these will reveal that they are untenable . Releasing vast quantities of plastic-eating microbes into our environment might well help contain waste , but the evolutionary trajectory of these organisms will be rapid and unpredictable . More importantly , the plastic industry is closely tied to the fossil fuel industry and , without ending mass consumption of plastics , the problem will likely get worse . <p> As for cloning , yes , it would make sense to save species this way , but for one basic biological problem . Clones would lack genetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease . Also , the rate at which plant and animal life are going extinct is so rapid that we have already lost hundreds of thousands of species . It is not clear whether enough could be saved to restore the ecosystem to health . <p> Carbon-capture is a pipe dream because the number of resources and energy it would take to reduce GHGs in the atmosphere and have negative emissions large enough to reverse global warming trends would be self-defeating . It is also probably too late , as vital tipping points have been crossed . For instance , the extent of Arctic summer ice melt is expected to reach by 2035 , levels not anticipated till 2090 . <p> The thawing of Siberia and the Arctic/Antarctic might well produce a new breadbasket but , if the same intensive farming techniques are applied , the soil will degrade within a few decades . There are also bacteria and viruses lurking in the melt against which humans have no immunity . Sending large numbers of people to settle in these regions is probably not the best idea , while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflict . <p> For all our space cadets , there is the unfortunate fact that the Earth is now surrounded by debris , and that the carbon cost of spaceflight is so great that sending large numbers to other worlds is not feasible . Even if large numbers could be sent , what exactly would they do on the Moon or on Mars ( the two likeliest destinations ) that might help save humanity back on Earth ? <p> Terraforming is possible ( over centuries ) , at least in the case of Mars , but it would require massive investment from a dying Earth . And would it not make more sense to do what was needed to save the one planet in our solar system where the air is breathable , than squandering resources on trying to make another place more like Earth ? <p> But the Pangloss effect is so powerful that nothing can deter the optimist from believing that the future is only going to be better . Optimists can not seriously contemplate any reality in which their lives and convenience are no longer sustainable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we put aside our Pangloss lenses . Optimists , in practice , would rather condemn their children and the planet to an agonising demise while retaining the cheerful disposition made possible by their inability to study the abyss that lies before us . <p> Being unable to comprehend reality , optimists are less likely to actually do what is needed to survive . Modern optimists are in such complete thrall to the delusion of human power that they have almost universally succumbed to the power of human delusion . To save the planet and , incidentally , ourselves , humans , especially the rich and clever ones , need to stop being optimistic and embrace realism , scepticism , and pessimism . <p> Pessimism and its cousins -- realism and scepticism -- are often wrongly understood as negativism or cynicism . Many people who would consider themselves optimists , like economists who adhere to Nordhaus 's absurd analysis of the GDP impact of climate change , are in functional terms negative and cynical . This is so because they sell people a placebo and set everybody up for catastrophic failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ought to comprehend our trajectory logically . If that analysis leads us to conclude that the trajectory is terminal , then realistically , we have two options . The first is to try to avert the outcome , and the other is to find a way to survive it if it is unavoidable . <p> Let 's illustrate this approach with some examples from history . During the 1930s , fascism was ascendant and , after the advent of Nazi rule in Germany , it appeared that a new and irresistible force in world affairs was emerging . The overwhelming majority of the British and French people wanted peace , and their political leaders shared this pious hope . <p> Hitler , as communicated by the French and British ambassadors to Berlin , was not interested in peace . He wanted war and was fanatically committed to Nazi ideology . In pursuit of ideological objectives , Hitler was prepared to show tactical flexibility , but the outcomes he sought were predetermined . <p> While governments in the United Kingdom and France tried to do business with Hitler , Winston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Nazis were dead serious about their insane ideology and that they were not seeking accommodation but an advantageous strategic position from which to annihilate all opposition to their millennial utopian vision . <p> From Churchill 's perspective , every concession to Nazi Germany merely delayed an inevitable conflict to a point in the future where the Allies would be relatively weaker . Churchill was being pessimistic . He desperately wanted to save his country from a calamitous war with Nazi Germany and felt that this required reacting harshly to Hitler 's foreign policy while the Allies still held the military advantage . <p> For nearly six years , Churchill opposed public opinion , defied his party 's leadership , and incurred the wrath of the great and the good . By the time the rest of his country had woken up to the reality of a Nazi Empire , the war had begun on less favourable terms . Elevated in the midst of this crisis to the premiership , Churchill proved to be a ruthless warlord , utterly committed to the destruction of Nazi Germany . <p> Churchill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and would be propelled by his worldview to relentlessly expand the conflict to hasten the achievement of the Nazi millennium . To his people , Churchill 's message was stark . Even if the United Kingdom fell to the Nazis , the war would continue , because a world dominated by Nazism was not one worth living in . <p> In other words , by the end of May 1940 , Churchill resolved to risk the destruction of his homeland ( even though the Nazis were prepared to cut a deal ) in order to defeat a threat that , if allowed to prevail , would have turned the world into a nightmarish racial dystopia . It is to this heroic pessimism , more than anything else , that Churchill owes his place in history . <p> Pessimism as a solution <p> Two older instances of pessimism inducing rational thinking are of Metternich and Bismarck . The former wrestled with the old problem of Central Europe ( i.e. Germany being either too weak or too strong for the peace of Europe ) and devised the German Confederation -- a union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decentralised to avoid being tempted into aggression . <p> After the rise of German nationalism proved too much for the loose structure of the Confederation to bear , Prussia , under Bismarck , ejected Austria from the organisation and united the rest of Germany into a single state . Once this unification was achieved , Bismarck changed tack and declared that Germany was content with the new map of Europe . He proceeded to reconcile Austria , befriend Russia , keep Britain neutral , and ensure France had no major allies with which to encircle the new Central European giant . <p> For Bismarck , an overly aggressive foreign policy would lead to the rapid encirclement of Germany and risk plunging it into a war on multiple fronts . After Bismarck 's exit in 1890 , a new generation of optimistic German leaders , who were supremely confident in their nation 's newfound success , abandoned the policy of restraint and gradual accumulation of strength through development and embarked upon a global policy aimed at securing their country 's place amongst the three global empires ( Britain , France , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feared . By 1894 , France and Russia became allies , followed a decade later by France and Britain and , by 1907 , Germany had succeeded in driving all three empires into an anti-German alliance . <p> In some respects , the world is confronting a situation similar to a century ago , with China as the emerging superpower . Under Deng Xiaoping , Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao , China focused on its internal development and became a development success story by rejecting neoliberal ideas and focusing on using its state-regulated economy to gain a competitive advantage over Western rivals , while investing heavily in improving the lives of its people through governance and welfare spending and eschewing foreign entanglements . <p> Since 2013 , however , China has been headed in a more assertive direction and threatening the United States ' hegemony in East Asia . This is , in part , a consequence of greater optimism and confidence arising from unprecedented material prosperity and rising nationalistic sentiment . China 's current premier , Xi Jinping , is breaking with Deng Xiaoping 's institutional legacy by doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and elevating his thought as part of the constitution . <p> What these and many other instances , such as Napoleon 's invasion of Russia , can teach us is that wise leaders try to grasp reality while unwise ones disregard it , often with catastrophic consequences . The trouble is that optimistic rulers , who are normally incapable of wise decision-making , resonate better with people who , in turn , are basically guided by regard for their own convenience . <p> It was perhaps for this reason that Voltaire , a great advocate of the Enlightenment and a leader of the forces of the empire of reason against traditionalism and conventional mindlessness , felt deeply pessimistic in concluding his universal history : " As nature has placed in the heart of man interest , pride and all the passions , it is no wonder that , during a period of about six centuries , we meet with almost a continual succession of crimes and disasters . If we go back to earlier ages , we shall find them no better . Custom has ordered it so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In other words , Pangloss nearly always wins , and the real interests of humanity nearly always lose . This is worth bearing in mind as we examine the geopolitics of a post-apocalyptic world . <p> Excerpted from the chapter ' The Pangloss Effect : Why Optimism is Lethal ' in the author 's book Downfall : Lessons For Our Final Century , recently published by the Centre for Strategic and Contemporary Research <p> The author is a tenured professor in the Department of History at the Quaid-i-Azam University in Islamabad <p> Highly terrifying projections of future not far .

Given information overhung resounding unison employment of counter-narratives , peculiarities of Pakistan 's security landscape demand reinvigoration of the national narrative to help defend its ideological and geographical boundaries . <p> Academically , scholars of international relations are in agreement to relate narrative with deliberate and well-crafted themes and ideas to systematically represent a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to project our identities , priorities , national goals , and objectives .

Narratives based on a politico-ideological basis which were propagated during the Cold War era and post 9/11 have actually polarized the world . However , since its independence , Pakistan has struggled to develop and disseminate a singular narrative suiting the very fabric of its state . <p> Advertisement <p> Debate on the institutional framework for narrative development in Pakistan brings to fore the country 's inability to translate its peculiar ideology , culture , geography , and foreign policy , into a wholesome national narrative .

Major issues which bewilder this confusion include misperception of national identity , a weak democratic system and governance , a uniform education system , and a tattered economy .

She died in the custody of the so-called Morality Police on September 16 for allegedly violating Iran 's public veiling laws . <p> Amini 's tragic death is another reminder of how Tehran 's Islamist rulers continued to DEAL WITH the demands of the Iranian people . Opposition to wearing the hijab or niqab is one of many public complaints . The violence that led to Amini 's death was no accident . <p> - Advertisement - <p> This is an integral part of Iran 's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei 's stance on any political disagreement . He believes violent repression will force protesters to retreat . hOWEVER , his political decisions deepen raw public anger against the Islamic Republic . Not only is Khamenei inciting the Iranian people against the government , his insistence on wearing the hijab is also dividing the ranks of Islamic scholars as well as Iranian society . <p> Khamenei tricked Ibrahim Raisi into becoming Iran 's president in the election in June 2021 . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , building new housing and fighting corruption . None of these promises has been kept till daye . Instead , the Raeesi government has allocated additional funds to the country 's security forces to enforce Iran 's mandatory laws more strictly , particularly hijab . There are reports that Iran now wants to introduce mass electronic surveillance of the population based on the Chinese model . <p> In Khamenei 's view , a compromise with the Iranian people in one area would only lead to a flood of demands for changes in other areas , from domestic to foreign policy . For this reason , Khamenei has ordered a crackdown on the " anti-Hijab " movement . In recent months , the government has relentlessly used torture and harsh prison terms to quell the " great insurgency " behind the anti-Hijab campaign . It has even encouraged pro-government members of the public to take matters into their own hands and confront those who disobey compulsory hijab laws in public . <h> The protests transcended common racial lines and brought together groups that are often divided . Last summer , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Arabs , joined forces in protests against polluted water and air in the southwestern province of Khuzestan <p> This situation has created new and controversial fault lines in society and has separated minorities who oppose the compulsory hijab from the majority who support it , who see it as a fundamental violation of basic human rights . Since 1979 , a younger generation of Iranians , especially women , is now protesting against the compulsory hijab laws not only to challenge them , but it also challenges the Islamic Republic 's strict socio-religious beliefs and their permanence . <p> Anti-Hijab protests in Iran have already been successful . The Islamic hijab rule has been enforced in Iran since the Islamic Revolution in 1979 . According to the law , women and girls over the age of nine must cover their heads in public . However , their intensity varies from administration to administration , depending on the political background of the incumbent chief . Backed by the country 's ultra-conservative religious elite , Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi called the recent backlash against the hijab law " a systematic encouragement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , earlier this month the deputy prosecutor of Mashhad in northeastern Iran wrote a decree banning women without headscarves from entering offices and banks or using the subway .

The call received a positive response on the morning of July 12 , and many videos and photos were posted on the electronic and print media . The New York-based International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran ( ICHRI ) expressed fears about " possible violence and arrests on July 12 . " The anti-hijab social media campaign is being led by Masih Elenjad , a US-based activist who has been behind several online campaigns over the past decade . <p> During the 2017-2019 protests , several protesting women were arrested and many were seriously injured in the police action .

These anti-hijab protests are dominated by women 's revolt against the objectification of their bodies . <p> In a study conducted at Swinburne University of Technology in Australia , participants who wore hijab explained that Islamic concepts of modesty and self-respect in relation to their sexuality led them to view " women as precious as diamonds " . Ironically , in a tweet aimed at the Indian state , Nobel peace laureate Malala Yusufzai called the decision not to allow girls in hijab to go to school as " objectification " . The Iranian and Saudi Arabian experiences show that women want to free themselves from the hijab because it limits their role in modern society to that of a mere object . <p> The current wave of protests draws courage from past protests , but surpasses them in some important respects . First , women are leading the way and finding creative ways to challenge the government .

In addition to women and students , traders and shoppers are also protesting in Tehran 's market . In the past , they had already protested against the deteriorating economic situation and the devaluation of the Iranian currency . But this may be the first time in decades that they have not only protested for their own immediate economic interests but have shown solidarity with the girls and women who were killed by security forces during the 1979 revolution . <p> The protests transcended common racial lines and brought together groups that are often divided .

It is the same old story for a state which is out of tune with the developments of the world , because it is fighting itself , scheming and scheming and so on . <p> The political crisis which started with a key appointment within the higher corridors of decision making ; the appointment of the spy chief last autumn , unleashed the wave of events which culminated in a political quagmire in April , 2022 .

Whether regulatory bodies , federally managed defence forces , judiciary or any other such institution ; it is a foregone protocol that most of the decently democratic polities allow things to move as they are . <p> However , that was not supposed to be the case in Pakistan .

@@94154232 <h> Political priority list <p> Our current discourse in the political arena revolves essentially around corruption , various court cases related to this or to contempt of different kinds , and most lately , the audio leaks that have been emanating apparently from the Prime Minister Office . <p> Of course , corruption is important . Of course , we all deserve a nation which is not run by corrupt politicians interested only in their own welfare and not in that of the people they are elected to serve . But that is not the only issue on their agenda and ahead of a new general election within the coming months we need a clear-cut idea of what the parties are willing to offer and what their plans are . <p> In the first place , no party has come forward with an agenda that puts the people ahead of everything else . They deserve to be far higher on the priority list . This would mean offering them quality education in public-sector schools , so they are not forced to turn to madrassahs or to private schools which rip off parents in many cases and offer little in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service system which actually serves people rather than simply exploiting them or leaving them to wait for hours outside clinics or to see doctors . Even the so-called ' better government hospitals ' feature up to three or four patients forced onto a single bed with their attendants hovering around in crowded , cramped , and completely inadequate wards . <p> We also need a social welfare system of some kind , which can sustain people in this time of acute poverty and deprivation . The reports about an increase in street crime and possibly in the abduction of children in order to sell them or to perhaps hold them for ransom are disturbing . There is no confirmation of these reports which flood social media but it is possible that people will resort to desperate measures when they have no other means to live . Those means have to be provided through a working welfare system which can cater to the needs of people , particularly in these post-Covid times when floods have created further devastation and destruction across the country . The floods mean there is still more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of major food insecurity in the future if farmers are unable to plant their crops or follow the usual pattern of agricultural production . <p> Unfortunately , none of our parties have an agenda which focuses on any of this . Indeed , since the 1970s , we have not seen any party offer anything which is essentially pro-people rather than centered on individuals and on the concerns of individual leaders . Simply the tradition of handing over parties from a parent to a child , as happened in the case of the PPP , and can also be seen within the PML-N , is an example of how little political leaders really care about what their parties are doing , and are focused essentially only on holding on to power . Till the 1970s , the PPP , as a center-left party , had offered some hope with its slogan of ' roti , kapra aur makaan ' . Since then , it has faltered even on this , and of course , Zulfikar Ali Bhutto failed to deliver on his promises , unable to carry out the landforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the largest land holdings and the most vested feudal interest . <p> Today we have a system where there is really no difference in ideology between the various parties . The differences are minor and , in many ways , insignificant . Even the agenda of the JUF-F is not all that different from that of the PTI and the PML-N , and the PPP can not really be separated in terms of what side of the ideological divide they stand on . This is increasingly true of the world itself . The collapse of the Soviet Union removed the backing that many left-leaning parties felt they needed in order to pursue their vision and push through their particular notions of what should be happening . Today , the Democrats and the Republicans in the US , or Labour and the Tories in the UK are essentially similar in what they offer with only nuances available to distinguish one from the other . <p> For Pakistan , this is a tragedy . Unlike so many other countries , we have failed in the years to invest in people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that 50 per cent of our children are stunted or unable to reach the expected height by age is shocking . It signifies the extent of malnutrition which affects the population , with many families surviving on merely one meager meal a day or even less . The under-five mortality rate is amongst the highest in the world . <p> Unlike nations such as Malaysia , we have failed to put money into the welfare of people and failed to put their concerns ahead of everything else . As a result , all we have is chaos -- with parties now deeply divided and their followers taking the same extreme lines in their attitudes towards where they stand , and what they want . Imran Khan 's attempts to portray himself as the heroic saviour have faltered . There are now multiple stories about what he has been engaged in , taking away from his image of being at the very least an honest man . But it is also true that many of his followers simply do not believe what appears in the press and what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PTI , based on traditional media and social media , ensures this in many ways -- putting forward story after story about the corruption of the Sharif family and of PPP leaders while ignoring what is happening within the PTI itself . This leaves us in a mess from which it seems difficult to escape . <p> It is worth looking at the fact that Bangladesh is now well ahead of us in terms of development in so many sectors . It has been able to control population growth , offer education to many more people including girls , control infant and child mortality , and encourage measures of other kinds which empower people . We have failed . This is impossible for many of us to fully accept given the manner in which the then East Pakistan was treated in the days before it became a separate country . But this is not the main point : the main argument is that we need to rethink , we need to develop a new vision , and we need to put people at the top of the political priority list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind . A revolution from the left would of course , be best of all given what we need . But it is hard to see if it is coming . There is no viable attempt to unite the parties or groups which make up the small leftist factions and parties in the country and bring them together . Had this existed , we may have been in a better place with stronger voices available to at least challenge the narrative that is now put forward again and again by all political parties and coming out stronger now in this time of total division between the major parties in the country . <p> We need change and we need it quickly . Otherwise , it may be too late for Pakistan and certainly too late for its people with children currently struggling to survive in flood-hit areas across Sindh , southern Punjab , Balochistan and other parts of the country due to the lack of help and assistance they have received from an inept and uncaring government . 
@@94154233 <h> Diplomacy : back on track ? <p> On their recent visit to the United States to attend the 77th session of the UN General Assembly , Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto held dozens of bilateral and multilateral meetings with their counterparts . <p> It is reassuring to note that rather than going down the dangerous path of taking sides , their engagements with leaders from all countries , including the US , China , Russia , and the Muslim world , remained equally cordial . The success or failure of their diplomacy will be seen in the future , but this can be stated with confidence : both the prime minister and the foreign minister said all the right things , and successfully avoided making controversial remarks , which , if they had indulged in , would have the potential of damaging Pakistan 's national interests . <p> The other related and reassuring element was that both the leaders , in all their interactions , made it clear that Pakistan 's national interests guided their behaviour , rather than anything else . One common denominator in their interactions with world leaders , think tanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything which could have shown them standing with one power bloc or the other in the international arena , thus potentially putting Pakistan 's national interests in jeopardy . <p> Pakistan 's foreign relations are always guided by the country 's founding father Muhammad Ali Jinnah 's strong assertions that the country would seek cordial relations with all . This belief emanated from his strong conviction in the fact that for a new and a medium-sized country like Pakistan , it was never a good idea to indulge in bloc politics . Therefore , Pakistan has always maintained , as far as it was in its power to do so , to maintain friendly relations with all the important global players -- the US , China , the former Soviet Union ( now Russia ) , and the Muslim world . This policy has served Pakistan well . It was only due to its aversion to bloc politics that Islamabad was able to play the role of a bridge between the US and China in the 1970s , the benefits of which it is still reaping in the shape of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The comment of Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto in a recent media interaction in which he said that " we are not a geopolitical football " to be played by one big power against another is exactly the kind of foreign policy that Pakistan needs to pursue . Pakistan has already suffered immeasurably due to its involvement in the different wars fought in Afghanistan for the last more than four decades . Statements , emanating from Pakistan 's foreign and strategic policy-making establishment , indicate that the idea that it is best for Pakistan to stay away from international conflicts has sunk in . There are also indications that policymakers in Islamabad are convinced that the only path that Pakistan must follow to maintain its national security and integrity is through economic development . And for that , Pakistan can not afford to take unnecessary sides in international power politics . <p> For a country like Pakistan , with the host of problems it faces including economic under-development , climate catastrophe , energy deficiency , poor human development indicators , governance issues and institution-building , it needs the support of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia , and the oil rich countries in the Middle East . It can not afford to have less than cordial relations with any of these power centers . <p> China has emerged as the second largest economy in the world . Pakistan needs Chinese support in multiple fields including infrastructure building in the fields of communication , energy , and industrial development under the umbrella of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor . <p> Neither can Pakistan afford to have bad relations with the US , which is a favourite destination for the country 's exports , especially in the textile sector , which constitutes approximately 60 per cent of Pakistan 's total exports . Islamabad has historically enjoyed good relations with the US in the defence industry and the latter has been one of the main suppliers to Pakistan in the defence sector . <p> Similarly , Islamabad needs to maintain good friendly relations with Moscow , which is rich in energy resources as well as a favourite address to procure edible oil and wheat , not to speak of the complex geo-strategic location in which Pakistan is situated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia . <p> Pakistan needs friendly relations with the Arab countries of the Middle East for multiple reasons , including the fact that millions of Pakistani labourers working in these countries are the main source of remittances from these countries , the diplomatic support that these countries provide on different sensitive issues , and it being one of Pakistan 's main suppliers in the oil and gas sector . <p> From the aforementioned visit by Pakistan 's leaders and the kind of attention that they received from the international community , including from the UN chief , US President Joe Biden , US Secretary of State Blinken , Russian President Putin , and French President Macron , apart from their meetings with the leaders of international financial institutions , it can be safely concluded that the world has finally come round to the outcome that Pakistan needs to be listened to , and helped . That is good news , and Pakistani leaders need to build on that momentum . <p> But the most important factor which needs to be ensured to capitalize on Pakistan 's cordial foreign relations is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literate human resource , and a modern and diversified industrial base in order to prosper . <p> We often boast of our overwhelming young population . But this will remain a serious challenge for Pakistan unless it is converted into an opportunity by mass education .

@@94154234 <h> Issues for COP27 <p> The UN Climate conference ( COP27 ) to be convened on November 6-18 at the Egyptian Red Sea resort Sharm El Sheikh will grapple with a number of issues that lie at the core of global climate action against a daunting political and economic backdrop . The negotiations are likely to be protracted , contentious and acrimonious , betraying a deepening North-South divide . <p> Russia 's invasion of Ukraine in February triggered not only a political crisis but also an escalating hike in energy prices and threatened food shortages in dozens of countries dependent on Russian and Ukrainian grain supplies . The sanctions against Russia clamped by the US and Europe have raised the spectre of energy shortages in the UK and EU states during the winter . <p> Pakistan has been ravaged by heavy monsoonal rains preceded by fierce heatwaves causing colossal human and material losses . Scores of other countries all over the world experienced unusually high temperatures , heatwaves , drought conditions causing the drying up of rivers and lakes , and ferocious cyclones and forest fires . <p> Global carbon emissions have gone up to an all-time high recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below 2 degrees Celsius and preferably 1.5 degrees Celsius proclaimed in the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement unachievable . In April , the UN Climate Panel ( IPCCC ) released its sixth assessment report warning the world that unless carbon releases are reduced by 45 per cent by 2030 an unbearable climate catastrophe would be unavoidable . <p> In June 2022 , the annual mid- year climate conference of senior officials and the two subsidiary bodies of the UN climate agreements took place in Bonn to discuss major issues which could not be resolved at COP26 in Glasgow . Based on a review of the outcomes of COP26 and the Bonn conference , climate change analysts have identified the following six priority issues for COP27 . <p> 1 . Financial mechanism for addressing loss and damage : the loss and damage ( L&amp;D ) issue refers to the persistent demands of poor countries and small island states for compensation for the irreversible damage inflicted by climate change . This issue has become synonymous with the imperative of climate justice since vulnerable countries had no role in creating climate change but are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries , supported by G77 and China , have been demanding a dedicated funding facility for actions to " avert and minimize " the negative consequences of climate change , developed countries have insisted that the hardships faced by vulnerable states can and should be addressed through adaptation . <p> At COP26 , developing countries had pushed hard for the creation of an L&amp;D financing facility . However , owing to the fierce opposition of the US and OECD countries , the conference established the Glasgow Dialogue to run until 2024 on possible funding arrangements relating to L&amp;D . <p> At the first meeting of the L&amp;D Dialogue in Bonn in June , developing countries demanded the creation of a financial facility immediately , not in 2024 . The US and most other rich countries once again insisted that L&amp;D funding requests should be referred to existing funding windows such as the Green Climate Fund ( GCF ) although the Fund 's current mandate does not cover L&amp;D funding and it has in any case never received the funding promised by developed countries . Developing countries seek " new and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand that L&amp;D should be taken up at COP27 under a specific Agenda item . <p> 2 . Scale up support for adaptation : the sixth IPCC assessment has called for enhanced adaptation measures . This has encouraged developing countries to step up efforts for increased funding for adaptation which has so far received around a quarter of the funding approved by the GCF . At COP26 , developed countries agreed to double funding for adaptation from the 2019 level by 2025 amounting to $40 billion ! <p> At the Sharm El Sheikh conference , developing countries will demand substantial progress on the Global Goal on Adaptation ( established in 2015 for defining a framework for enhancing adaptive capacity , strengthening resilience , and reducing vulnerability ) . COP26 set up a Glasgow -- Sharm El Sheikh Work Program ( 2022-2033 ) for developing a binding GGA . At COP27 , four workshops are envisaged under this programme . <p> 3 . Mitigation -- strengthen national emission targets : the Glasgow Pact ( containing the outcome of COP26 ) called on all states to " revisit and strengthen " their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( NDCs ) . So far , only 23 countries have submitted new or revised NDCs . A few others such as India , Australia , Mexico , Indonesia , Egypt , Turkey and Vietnam are expected to declare revised emission reduction pledges prior to COP27 . <p> Meanwhile , think tank Ember 's disclosure that European countries intended to invest over $48 billion on fossil fuel infrastructure to address the disruption of Russian supplies has dismayed climate activists . The Glasgow Work Program to scale up mitigation ambition has remained unimplemented . <p> 4 . Ensure fulfillment of the $100 billion annual climate funding pledge : at COP27 , developing countries will once more press developed countries to fulfill their pledge announced in 2009 to collectively mobilize $100 billion for funding climate actions in developing countries . <p> Developed countries provided only $83.3 billion in 2020 , marking a slight increase over the $79.6 billion provided in 2019 . <p> At COP27 , discussions are likely to commence on setting a new Collective Finance Goal to be agreed at COP28 due to be held in 2023 in the UAE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the June 2022 climate meeting , the scope and content of the Global Stocktake scheduled to be held during COP28 to assess progress in achieving the Paris Agreement goals was discussed without reaching a decision . Climate action groups have demanded that COP27 should seek to " advance " the Global Stocktake by defining a common vision for future climate action . <p> 6 . Turn the Glasgow commitments into action : at COP26 in Glasgow in 2021 , commitments were made by groups of countries and businesses to ( 1 ) curb their carbon emissions ; ( 2 ) stop and reverse deforestation ; ( 3 ) accelerate the phase out of coal ; ( 4 ) double funding for adaptation by 2025 ; and ( 5 ) end fossil fuel financing . <p> In Glasgow , more than a hundred world leaders promised to end and reverse deforestation by 2030 .

The date for local government elections in Karachi is set for October 23 and by-elections for eight National Assembly and three provincial assembly seats for October 16 . Of the eight National Assembly constituencies up for grabs , three are in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa , three in Punjab , and two in Sindh ( Karachi ) . For provincial assembly seats , all three by-elections will be held in Punjab . Since all these areas were not directly affected by any floods , there was no plausible reason for any postponement and Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja took the right step by reiterating his stance in this matter . Peaceful and timely holding of elections is a paramount responsibility of the ECP -- of course with the help of law enforcement and local administrations . <p> It is satisfying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the upcoming elections and the wherewithal is ready to be deployed . Even the federal government had sent a letter from the interior ministry last week requesting the ECP to put off the by-polls for 90 days due to security institutions and provincial administrations being busy in rehabilitation and relief operations after the floods . The interior ministry 's stance was that the holding of elections after the floods would place a strain on the capacity of the security institutions and could put the credibility of the by-polls in question . The federal government had also referred to the possibility of the PTI holding its long march to Islamabad precisely during the week the by-elections are scheduled . Similarly , the Sindh government had also requested the ECP to put off local government elections in Karachi for three months .

In Karachi the situation is likely to be different as the government of Sindh has not raised any questions about the ECP and its chief . But there the situation is slightly different for the local bodies elections that the Sindh government was not keen on holding for various reasons . Holding of elections is a constitutional requirement and holding of local bodies elections is imperative in a state that calls itself a democracy -- devolution of powers being an essential component of good governance .

@@94154236 <h> Zaitoon Bibi case <p> By Editorial Board <p> October 13 , 2022 <p> In a country where women are on the receiving end of injustices , the Supreme Court has finally granted a woman her right to inheritance -- after a 46-year-long legal battle . Zaitoon Bibi of Dera Ismail Khan could not get her due share of property from her father 's inheritance as her brothers kept denying it since 1976 . Earlier , thanks to a decision by a sessions court in 2017 -- and then by the Peshawar High Court -- Zaitoon Bibi should have received her due share in property . But then in 2018 her brothers moved the Supreme Court against the high court decision in her favour . Now the apex court of the country has recognized Zaitoon Bibi 's share in her father 's property and dismissed the brothers ' appeal . The SC verdict is a welcome development given that in Pakistan many women do not get their inheritance and , more often than not , are made to ' give up ' their inheritance in favour of the male members of their families . This practice has led to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , instead of being financially independent . This is also why many women are unable to leave abusive marriages or abusive situations at their own homes because they do not have the financial means for an escape . In this particular case too , the petitioners ' counsel argued that Zaitoon had gifted her inheritance right to her brothers nearly half a century ago . The Supreme Court rightly observed that Zaitoon Bibi was a minor at that time and could not gift her property to her brothers . <p> Unfortunately , Pakistan remains the second-worst country for women in the Global Gender Gap Index -- women being subjected to abuse , violence and also denied their rights either through force , emotional blackmail in the garb of ' culture and tradition ' or because they are not even aware of their own rights . In 2021 , the Enforcement of Women 's Property Rights ( Amendment ) Bill was approved but , despite what the laws say , we have seen the impunity accorded to those that insist -- and they are in the majority -- on depriving women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Article 23 of our constitution says , " Every citizen shall have the right to acquire , hold and dispose of property in any part of Pakistan , subject to the constitution and any reasonable restrictions imposed by law in the public interest . " Islam also gives women their inheritance rights -- but when it comes to property and women , conveniently both legal and religious decrees are somehow forgotten . The fact that the decisions by lower courts were repeatedly challenged shows the obstinate behaviour of those who refuse to accept a woman 's share in property . Zaitoon Bibi 's case is a prime example that women have to fight long and hard battles before they can get their rights . For over four decades , a woman was denied her due share in inheritance . We hope it wo n't take another 46 years for another Zaitoon Bibi to get what is her rightful inheritance .

So to see a British Indian leader is phenomenal , " he told Reuters . <p> But Sunak 's marriage to the daughter of an Indian billionaire has raised concerns in the party that he is too far removed from the concerns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by spiralling inflation to decide whether to spend their money on food or heating . <p> It did n't help that in April , Sunak 's wife was forced to confirm reports that her non-domiciled status meant she did not pay tax on all her international earnings , something she agreed to end . <p> " Rishi never had an overdraft so he is used to having a treasury ( finance ministry ) account and a current account , " said one Conservative insider who had backed Johnson . <p> " Rishi has good PR but an inability to be brave and be the Brexit Chancellor the UK needs , " the insider said on condition of anonymity . <p> Sunak 's supporters say he is just the man who is needed to steady the ship financially after Truss 's so-called mini-budget roiled financial markets , raising government borrowing and increasing mortgages and fears pensions funds could go bust . <p> " We need someone who can provide stability and proven economic competence in these challenging times , and Rishi Sunak is that person , " said Grant Shapps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his predecessor . <p> Shapps was just one of several ministers to back Sunak after Johnson pulled out late on Sunday , surprising and even angering his own supporters . Johnson has not made public who he backed . <h> Covid champion <p> Sunak rose swiftly up the ranks of the Conservative Party , becoming , in 2020 , one of the youngest finance ministers . <p> When the Covid-19 pandemic hit Britain , Sunak dropped the Conservatives ' small-state instincts to borrow massively and stave off the risk of an economic depression . <p> That made him one of the most popular politicians in the country , as he was praised for helping businesses and workers . <p> In one photograph that captured the sense of unity behind his rescue plans , Sunak posed outside his Downing Street office flanked by the heads of Britain 's biggest trade union group and a leading employers ' group . <p> But that consensus disappeared as Britain emerged from the crisis saddled with an extra 400 billion pounds of debt and then fell into a cost-of-living crisis that led to even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year showed his stock had fallen with the public , who were worried about the cost of living crisis and angered that he had raised payroll taxes while his wife had avoided British levies . <p> Labour leader Keir Starmer is expected to seize on the appointment of a new wealthy prime minister by Conservative lawmakers rather than by the country as a reason why Britain should face a national election before it is due in two years . <p> " My focus is on the millions of people who are struggling to pay their bills , now have additional anxieties about their mortgage .

" They remind us of the ugly time around 2007 when the heavenly environment of Swat valley was transformed into hell , " she whispered , her voice barely carrying over the phone . <p> According to Gulikhandana , who spoke to me on the phone in July earlier this year , the militants had encamped in the nearby hills and would take to the streets after dark . " The sightings are n't just limited to our area ; there are reports of the presence of militants in other parts of Swat 's Matta tensil too , " she said . <p> Fawad Khan , a resident of Swat 's Kabal tehsil , confirmed Gulikhandana 's suspicions .

However , SHO Chupriyal Tariq Khan dismissed the reports and said the police had fired shots into the air after spotting a suspicious person . <p> In a related development on August 8 , a video surfaced on social media in which a man -- who claimed to be affiliated with the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ) -- could be seen interviewing Matta circle DSP Pir Syed Khan , and two other personnel , who as per unverified claims , belonged to Pakistan Army . The man conducting the interview also claimed in the video that the three individuals were held captive by the TTP . <p> Meanwhile , a recorded telephone call , allegedly between a Taliban militant and a journalist , also started making the rounds on social media .

" The militants entered Balasoor from Afghanistan through the mountains of Upper Dir and opened fire when surrounded by the police , " stated the press release . <p> That same day , residents of Chuprial and other parts of Matta tehsil said they saw several police vans rushing towards the area . " We saw a large number of police vehicles rushing towards Matta on Monday , August 8 , " said Haider Khan , a resident of Bara Bandai village . The police , on the other hand , did not divulge further details on the incident . <p> Less than a week later , the military 's media wing , the ISPR , issued a press release , lending credence to reports of the presence of a " small number of armed men on few mountain-tops between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TTP running amok in the mountains . <p> According to the ISPR statement , " required measures are in place by all LEAs for the safety and security of people of adjoining areas . Presence of militants anywhere will not be tolerated and they will be dealt with full use of force if required " . <h> Picking up the ante <p> A month later on September 13 , seven workers of a private mobile network , including two communications engineers , were abducted by militants , who demanded a huge amount as ransom for their release . Five of the abducted persons were released later the same day , while the two engineers were kept in custody . <p> One of the abducted persons , who was released later in the day , told me that their team was working at a mobile phone tower when 10 masked men , armed with modern weapons , blindfolded them and took them to an unidentified location . <p> The contractor , who also asked not to be named , told me that they were installing a mobile phone tower at Jana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sept 13 , I had gone to get some material for the tower installation .

Two passersby were also killed in the explosion . <p> On September 16 , unidentified persons shot dead another village defence committee member at Dakorak village in Charbagh tehsil , late in the evening .

As a result , a man who owned the weight station and his son were killed on one side , while four persons from the other side were critically injured . The deceased were identified as Ali Syed and his son Anees Ahmad . <p> However , the Counter Terrorism Department ( CTD ) police later issued a press release , claiming that the two deceased persons , who were father and son , were informers for the militants , and that they were killed in an encounter with the security forces . <p> Locals and relatives of the deceased refuted the allegations , however , saying the father-son duo were not involved in any anti-state activities and had run the weight station for a long time . <p> " It was a monetary issue as one of my brothers had taken Rs3,500,000 from a party and had fled , after which our father returned about 80 per cent of the money .

The next day , the CTD issued the press release , implicating the deceased as being informants for militants . <p> This attempt to paint the victims as militants did not go down well with the already wary people of Swat , leading to mass protests across the valley .

The protesters said they wanted to send a clear message to the state and the law enforcement agencies that they would not be willing to let anyone sabotage peace in Swat at any cost . <p> " We have witnessed one of the ugliest times in Swat 's history when the TTP militants challenged the writ of the state and held the entire security apparatus hostage .

We are peaceful , and we want peace in Swat , " said Mukhtiyar Yousafzai , a member of the Swat Qaumi Jirga , adding that the government and security agencies must not repeat the mistake of bringing militants to Swat again . <p> Also at the protest , Haji Zahid Khan , the president of Swat Hotels Association , recalled the three years of insurgency in Swat from 2007 till 2009 , when Mullah Fazlullah , through his FM radio station , misled the people of Swat and started mobilising them for his own interests .

Things are right with the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan ; they are not involved in targeted killings and extortion , " he said at a press conference in Peshawar on August 15 . <p> Two months on , however , Barrister Saif seemed to have changed his tune in October , when he addressed a press conference earlier this week . Distancing the provincial government from the negotiations , Barrister Saif said provincial government was making no deal with TTP ; rather it was standing with the people of the province .

If you continue to feel a lump , even during breastfeeding , you should have it checked . <p> Myth 4 : Biopsy leads to spread of breast cancer . <p> Truth : A needle biopsy is the first step in diagnosis , without which doctors can not proceed with treatment . <p> The earliest detection of breast cancer is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that breast cancer is going to kill them but it is completely treatable as long as it is identified and diagnosed early . The earlier it is diagnosed , the shorter the treatment and the better the outcome . A very important step for diagnosis is a biopsy . <p> Myth 5 : Breast cancer will take away your life or your breasts . <p> Truth : Early diagnosis and proper and complete treatment can not only save lives , but also the breasts . The doctors will extract the tumour and in the best case scenario , save the rest of the breast and reshape it . <p> In cases where the breast must be sacrificed , despite trying everything to save it , reconstruction is an option . <h> Signs , symptoms and detection of breast cancer <p> A lot of people are unaware of the fact that detection of breast cancer can actually begin at home through a self breast examination . It becomes even more handy for those who can not access medical facilities . <p> Dr Amina Khan , Consultant Surgical Oncologist at Shaukat Khanum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the importance of self-examination is especially true in our society where facilities for screening are not readily available to everybody . " In that regard , we ask women to check themselves thoroughly once a month and the signs and symptoms to look out for become very , very relevant . <p> " If you notice a thickening or a hardness or a lump anywhere in the region of the breast or the axillary tail , the tissue that goes from the breast into the axilla , or the armpit itself , it is a cause for concern and should prompt everyone to go and seek medical help . Besides a lump , it can be a rash in the skin of the breast that does not go away , a sense of tethering or a change in contour , discharge from the nipple especially if it has blood and any significant size change in the breast should prompt everyone to seek medical help , " she explained , listing the signs to look out for . <p> She termed mammography for screening the most important test . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ages 35 to 40 years . After that an annual screening mammogram is advised once a year to detect legions which are small enough not to be palpable or which ca n't be felt easily either by the patient or sometimes even by the doctor . <p> " Very , very tiny changes , early changes in the breast are picked up by these mammograms and are very helpful in the detection of cancer . Besides a mammogram , we complement this test with an ultrasound and ultrasounds are usually done where indicated in combination with the mammograms . " <p> Dr Khan noted that most of the lumps detected in the breast , thankfully , are not significant but the ones that are need to be evaluated , checked out and given due importance . <h> How to perform a self breast examination <p> If you do n't know how to perform a self breast exam , Dr Sana Zeeshan , Assistant Professor of Breast Surgery at Aga Khan University Hospital , has got you covered . A simple , two to three-minute test every month is all you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a very important procedure -- it is a task that every woman should perform once a month . In our country , very few women have access to an annual mammogram , the women who live far off in rural areas or the women who ca n't access a mammogram , it is especially necessary for them to pay attention to their breasts and armpits once a month . With this , the lumps that have been ignored can be picked up , " she said . <p> There are two steps to checking your breasts . First is noting any visual changes by exposing your breasts in front of a mirror and gazing at your breasts with your hands on your sides , on your back and on your head . They should look approximately the same . Any changes in the shape , size , skin or nipples should be noted . <p> Second is palpation or feeling the breasts . It is important to feel the breast you 're examining with the opposite hand ( i.e. feel the right breast with your left hand ) while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feel your breast with the flat surface of three fingers , moving them in circular motion over the breast and nipple region . With the same hand , feel your armpit as well and check for lumps , hardness or any new change that was n't there before . <p> It is necessary to feel your breasts while standing and while lying down . Do not press or poke your breasts , only feel with flat fingers . <p> Taking out two to three minutes every month for this task is very important . If you feel any change , you must contact your doctor immediately . Dr Zeeshan explained the reason why it needs to be performed once a month instead of daily or weekly -- so that new changes can be detected easily . Menstruating women should check their breasts and armpits after their period has ended while menopausal women can check their breasts on any day of the month . <h> Surgical approaches to treatment of breast cancer <p> People often equate breast cancer treatment with removal of the breasts . While that was the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the medical field that have enabled safe , breast-saving options . Dr Khan breaks down the processes involved in breast cancer treatment . <p> " As a surgeon , I can tell you that there have been massive advancements in how we 've progressed with the treatment of breast cancer . We 're moving gradually away from major surgery to more and more conservative surgery . I 'm happy to say that most of the cancers that we treat nowadays are offered and advised to have breast-saving surgery because it 's equally effective in the treatment of this disease , " she said . <p> Breast-saving surgery refers to a lumpectomy where the cancer in the form of a lump is removed . " In terms of what we do with the tiny lumps , we have imaging available , we have guidances available by radiology where these tiny legions can be localised and removed with small incisions . Mutilating surgery or big mastectomies are not warranted , " she added . <p> Similarly , for the armpit or axillary surgery also , there has been a shift to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lymph nodes are excised and the full axillary basin of lymph nodes does not need to be removed in patients . <p> There has been an advancement in reconstructive surgery as well , meaning that if the treatment absolutely requires breast removal , it can be replaced . These reconstruction operations are done at the time of the breast removal . <p> " Things have changed now , surgical techniques have improved , post-op care has improved . I 'm happy to say that the surgical treatment of breast cancer now has made this particular kind of treatment very , very different from how it used to be years ago . Most patients deal very well with the surgery for breast cancer and recover extremely well , " said Dr Khan . 
@@94377235 <p> ON the eve of the 20th Chinese Communist Party congress , which later confirmed a historic third term for President Xi Jinping , the US announced its National Security Strategy , reiterating its overwhelming priority is to " outcompete China " . The timing may have been coincidental . But it was telling that while President Xi was proclaiming China 's global power had increased , the US was resolving to deal with its " greatest geopolitical challenge " -- China . Asserting that the post-Cold War era is over , the NSS said competition was now underway between the major powers to shape the future of the international order in the " decisive decade " ahead . <p> The US document affirmed that the country 's principal strategic goal was to prevail in the competition with China , the only nation with the economic , military , diplomatic and technological muscle to reshape the global order . To pursue this aim , it sought to strengthen coalitions it was building , through Nato , the AUKUS security partnership , the Quad , Five Eyes group as well as its Indo-Pacific policy . Russia needed to be constrained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constituted an immediate threat evidenced by the Ukraine war , it lacked China 's broad-spectrum capabilities . <p> Given the politically fractured and polarised state of the US today , the NSS acknowledged America needed to fix its damaged democracy to be able to compete abroad . Claiming the national security strategy had " broken down the dividing line between foreign and domestic policy " , it said internal shortcomings would have to be remedied . Apart from a challenged democracy , it mentioned the threat from " domestic violent extremists " , including those " motivated by racial or ethnic prejudice " . Building internal strength meant investment in innovation , infrastructure , industrial and technological progress . <p> The theme of building domestic strength dominated President Xi 's address to the party congress . With development the top priority , his emphasis was on renewing " high-quality " economic growth by focusing on innovation and education and accelerating self-reliance in science and technology . But in urging preparedness to navigate " strong winds and high waves " and " danger in times of peace " , he called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Despite the tech war and tensions over Taiwan , economic decoupling is a distant possibility . <p> The goals marshalled out by the US and China are no surprise . Nor indeed their efforts to empower themselves for a more intense phase of competition that both agree is taking place in an unstable international environment . But in the near term , their stance on Taiwan might be the most consequential to their relationship and to international peace and security . President Xi 's pronouncements on the issue were unambiguous . Warning of " dangerous storms ahead " , he again drew a strategic red line in reiterating Beijing 's opposition to Taiwan 's independence . China sought peaceful reunification with Taiwan but it was for Beijing to decide its timing . He said China reserved the right to use force and other necessary measures but explained this message was " directed solely at interference by outside forces and the few separatists seeking Taiwan independence " and not the people of Taiwan . <p> China should be reassured by the reiteration of the One China policy in America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support Taiwanese independence . But the document also says Washington would oppose any unilateral effort to change the status quo . Beijing can take little comfort in combative statements by President Biden and back-to-back provocative US actions . Beijing sees these as contradicting Washington 's other more reasonable pronouncements in deliberate erosion of its One China policy . Biden has said several times he would be prepared to use military force if Taiwan was attacked by China . Even Western analysts construe this as a reversal of what was long described as a policy of ' strategic ambiguity ' , which stopped short of committing to militarily defend Taiwan while voicing concern for the island 's security . Recently , Washington also announced a billion-dollar arms package for Taiwan . This came on the heels of controversial visits by US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Congresspersons to Taipei . They were denounced by Beijing , which conducted missile tests around the Taiwan strait in a show of force . The US Congress is now set to authorise $10 billion in military aid over five years for Taipei . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tensions are escalating on other fronts too . Washington is engaged in a battle to maintain supremacy in technology , where the NSS states the aim is to outpace China . Earlier this month , the US announced wide-ranging measures to bar American companies from exporting chips and advanced chip equipment to China in order to cripple its semiconductor industry , that manufactures chips and circuits needed in modern electronics ranging from supercomputers and smartphones to automobiles . Semiconductors are also a vital element in the development of artificial intelligence , in which US experts believe China currently has the edge . These restrictions were the latest in the ' chip war ' and described as " the biggest shift in US policy " on tech exports to China since the 1990s . In response , Xi promised tech self-reliance in his address to the party congress . <p> American companies will also suffer by the US move . An important question is how far Washington is prepared to go in high-end technology decoupling and whether high-tech companies from other countries , none of whom were consulted , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries across the world especially if decoupling results in a potentially disruptive bifurcation of the digital world . <p> None of this means the two global powers will not continue to be economically interdependent . China remains the largest source of imports for the US , which provides its people goods at low prices . It is also one of the largest markets for US manufactures and products . The trade war waged by the US against China by slapping higher tariffs on imports and China 's counter measures has n't changed that ineluctable reality . American companies benefit greatly from doing business in China . China also continues to own a substantial amount of US debt -- around $1 trillion -- in Treasury securities . This makes economic decoupling a distant possibility . But the question is whether this can act as a sufficient brake on tensions between the world 's two largest economies and urge them towards what Henry Kissinger calls " co-evolution " even as they engage in intense competition and a high-end tech war . <p> China is and will always be a paper tiger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ReplyRecommend0 <p> Sheraz <p> Oct 24 , 2022 10:29am <p> Japan was also becoming world leader in late 80 's and it started stalling and its GDP had a nose dive decline .

@@94377237 <p> BALOCHISTAN 'S agony has once again been laid bare before Pakistan 's elected representatives . Akhtar Mengal , who heads his eponymous faction of the Balochistan National Party , made a blisteringly forthright speech in the National Assembly last Wednesday . <p> In it , he pulled no punches about the human rights violations in his province , warning the state that its tactics were sowing the seeds of hatred that would be impossible to eradicate . Indeed , according to him , most Baloch youth have " reached a point of no return " . Mr Mengal angrily denounced the fake encounters in the province in which innocent people were killed and presented as terrorists . He referred specifically to the incident in Kharan on Monday , where the Balochistan CTD allegedly killed three missing people they described later as BLA " terrorists " . <p> According to the CTD , the men opened indiscriminate fire on the law-enforcement team and were killed in an hour-long exchange of gunfire . However , the Voice for Baloch Missing Persons chairman said three of the dead men had been identified as missing people ; one of them -- the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- had been picked up on June 9 , 2021 , from Khuzdar . <p> There is a realisation among much of the civilian leadership that this is an untenable situation . Defence Minister Khawaja Asif , in response to Mr Mengal 's speech , acknowledged that remaining in denial of these long-festering wounds would be harmful for any nation . The weight of this baggage , he said , " was getting heavier by the day ... We need dialogue " . But who will bell the cat ? <p> The state 's neocolonial attitude towards Balochistan -- for how else can such utter disregard for its people 's fundamental rights and the extractive nature of the state 's relationship with the province be described ? -- is profoundly altering Baloch society . Alienation and despair run deep among its populace . Pakistan 's integrity and well-being are linked to all its people being given a fair deal and a just share in resources . Instead , Balochistan has descended into a dystopian hellhole , a laboratory of flawed and shortsighted policies , such as allowing violent extremist groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them to counter separatist groups . <p> There have been half-hearted attempts to address Balochistan 's grievances -- among them ' development packages ' under both the PML-N and the PPP governments -- but they have all come to naught because Balochistan was not to be allowed real agency over its workings or its resources , and people continued to go missing . And the much-vaunted ' game changer ' , CPEC , has only exacerbated the sense of marginalisation . Even the approach to the ' angry Baloch ' leaders went nowhere . <p> In any case , today 's educated , middle-class insurgents are more likely to despise the powerful Baloch sardars , whom they see as an extension of the state . A truth and reconciliation commission , as suggested at Wednesday 's National Assembly session , may be viable , but sincerity is in short supply when it comes to Balochistan . <p> " ..... sincerity is in short supply when it comes to Baluchistan ....

@@94400233 <p> As social media talks about high profile cases of domestic violence and abuse , it is important for people to remember that the first step to getting justice is filing a case . <p> Lawyer Nighat Dad shared on Twitter lessons learnt from the case of Aliza Sultan -- to build evidence , to clear phones and more . Here are six steps to report domestic abuse . <h> Build evidence and clear out your phone <p> The first thing women should learn is that if they are facing domestic violence , sexual harassment , sexual assault etc , it 's best to keep building evidence and share it with trustworthy people for safekeeping . Do n't just keep it on your own phone . This could include photographs of bruises and wounds or other forms of evidence . <p> Then comes the second step , which is to clear your phone of this evidence , as perpetrators in close proximity often have the tendency to surveil any physical moment and social media through your device in order to monitor your next move . <h> Complain to a police station and get a computerised slip <p> It may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police in Pakistan and then return to the same house . However , if the circumstances allow you to do so , the third step is to complain to your local police station . <p> In case you are a survivor of domestic or gender-based violence , you can write a complaint on a plain piece of paper and submit it to your local police station as soon as possible . On the submission of the complaint you receive a computerised slip from the help desk at the police station . <h> Consider medical examination in case of injury <p> In case you have been injured , you have every right to be medically examined by relevant medical officials . <p> In case if the police station in question does not send you for medical examination , you have every right to request one . To establish your case and if need be , can seek legal help and medico-legal opinion . <h> Do not bathe and change clothes for accurate medical results <p> A form of accompanying the injured person is then prepared under Rule 25.39 of the Police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accompany you for medical assessment . <p> The second step is a medico-legal report , which will be finalised after assessment of any wounds or injuries you may have . This assessment includes an X-ray and DNA tests but is not only limited to that . However , it is advised that to get accurate results , one must not bathe or change clothes . <h> Medical report is used in filing FIR against the abuser <p> Right after the medical examination , the medical officer fills out a form , No 25.39 of the Police Rules , and then dispatches it to the police station with a medico-legal report . This helps police officers to decide on what sections from the report will be used in filing the actual FIR against the abuser . <p> Now your case of domestic abuse will be recorded as per relevant sections of the Pakistan Penal Code , 1860 . It can be filed under <p> Section 332 ( Hurt ) -- whoever causes pain , harm , disease , infirmity or injury to any person or impairs , disables or dismembers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person without causing his death , is said to cause hurt . <p> Section 337 ( Shajjah ) -- whoever causes , on the head or face of any person , any hurt which does not amount to itlaf- ? i- ? udw or itlaf ? -i ? -salahiyyati ? -udw , is said to cause shajjah . <p> Section 376 ( Punishment for rape ) -- whoever commits rape shall be punished with death or imprisonment of either description for a term which shall not be less than ten years or more than 25 years and shall also be liable to fine . <h> Legal proceedings differ according to the province <p> Legal proceedings might differ according to which province you are in . For example , if you 're in Sindh or Balochistan , then domestic violence is criminalised whereas for Punjab it is a civil crime under The Punjab Protection of Women against Violence Act . <p> However , all remedies regarding strict action against domestic violence in any form are mentioned in the Pakistan Penal Code . <p> Tangible precautionary measures albeit Abuse is intentional , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of control " no he is in control ( how often do they lose control at work ? With a friend ? With other family members ? ) and purposely choose tactics to control their partners " Power and control over a partner " <p> Recommend0 <p> Punjabi first <p> Oct 25 , 2022 07:42pm <p> Good luck reporting anything at the police station . Unless you know someone who knows someone you are out of luck . Best to have strong family ties if possible and ask your brother 's or cousins to intervene asap.

@@94400238 <p> Islamabad High Court ( IHC ) Chief Justice Athar Minallah observed on Monday that PTI Chairman Imran Khan had not been barred from contesting in future elections following the Election Commission of Pakistan ( ECP ) verdict in the Toshakhana reference against him , adding that the former premier " wo n't face any problems " to contest in the NA-45 ( Kurram-I ) by-election scheduled to be held on Oct 30 . <p> His observation came during a hearing on Imran 's petition challenging the ECP decision to disqualify him over what the electoral watchdog said was his failure to properly account for monetary proceeds from the sale of Toshakhana gifts while he was the prime minister . <p> At the outset of the hearing , Imran 's lawyer , Barrister Ali Zafar , urged the court to start hearing the petition despite administrative objections by the registrar . <p> When Justice Minallah questioned what the hurry was , Zafar replied that his client had been disqualified ahead of the by-election in Kurram . <p> The IHC chief justice observed , " Imran Khan is not disqualified for that election . <p> " There should be one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this case . " <p> The court would hear the petition once the objections were removed , the judge said . <p> When Zafar requested the court to issue a stay order on the verdict , Justice Minallah pointed out that the ECP 's detailed judgement was not available yet . <p> " Which verdict should the court stay ? " he asked . " Imran does not want to return to the same seat he was disqualified from , does he ? " <p> Zafar argued that the stay was needed because the PTI chairman was contesting in an upcoming by-election . However , Justice Minallah said Imran would not face any problems in this regard . <p> When the counsel argued that the public would not understand the matter , Justice Minallah replied that it was not the court 's job to explain to the public . <p> " This has not happened previously . The court can not set such an example , " the judge remarked . <p> Zafar then said the ECP 's decision was also unprecedented . However , the IHC chief justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgement later . <p> The court expected a copy of the judgement to be released within three days , Justice Minallah said , adding that if it did not happen , then the court would look into the matter . <p> " The court issued directives to implement its verdict the same day in connection with a case related to inmates . The court should issue directives to the ECP to submit the verdict today in our case as well , " Zafar contended . <p> At this , the judge noted that in the case Zafar referred to , the inmates were being tortured which was why urgent directives were needed . <p> The PTI counsel said the present case was related to a democratic issue and the ECP could " change the verdict " . <p> Justice Minallah , however , remained firm , observing that the court would have listened to the petition if there was any reason to rush . <p> Zafar argued that the ECP had " changed its verdict " in the prohibited funding case against the PTI . " This case has become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to contest the election with it . " <p> " Many people have been disqualified before this case . Did it affect their politics ? This court does not issue directives to any constitutional body . We are giving a week 's time . If the verdict 's copy is not received , we will see then , " Justice Minallah said . <p> " Wait for the written verdict . This is a routine matter . The Election Commission is not delaying it , " he observed . <p> Zafar then told the court that the ECP had also directed to initiate legal proceedings against Imran to which the judge replied that the sessions court would hear that matter . <p> Subsequently , the court directed the PTI counsel to remove the objections on the petition within three days . <h> Imran 's disqualification and plea <p> The Tosha ? khana is a department under the administrative control of the Cabinet Division and stores precious gifts given to rulers , parliamentarians , bureaucrats , and officials by heads of other governments and states and foreign dignitaries . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received by persons to whom these rules apply shall be reported to the Cabinet Division . <p> A reference alleging that Imran had not shared details of the gifts he retained from the Toshaskhana and proceeds from their reported sales was filed by lawmakers from the ruling coalition in August , and the ECP concluded on Friday that the former premier had indeed made " false statement and incorrect declarations " regarding the gifts -- a ruling that prompted widespread protests by the PTI . <p> The watchdog 's order said Imran stood disqualified under Article 63(1) ( p ) of the Constitution . <p> Subsequently , Zafar filed a writ petition in the IHC on Imran 's behalf , requesting the court to declare the order " against the settled principles of law " on Article 63 . <p> The plea further urged the court to declare the ECP 's order " misconceived " and set it aside . <p> Imran also sought a court declaration stating that the ECP lacked the jurisdiction to decide " any questions of ' corrupt practices and disqualification ' " under the Election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> NA-45 was one of the four National Assembly constituencies of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa where polling for by-elections was originally scheduled for Oct 16 , but the ECP postponed it .

@@94447234 <p> Almost a year after his appointment as the head of Pakistan 's premier spy agency , Lt General Nadeem Anjum kept a low profile . Unlike his predecessors , he was never photographed or filmed as he preferred to stay away from the limelight . <p> But Thursday was an extraordinary day in Pakistan 's history as Director General Inter-Services Intelligence ( ISI ) Lt Gen Nadeem not only made a public appearance but became the first spymaster to address a live news conference . <p> When Director General Inter-Services Public Relations ( ISPR ) Lt General Babar Iftikhar announced at the end of his opening remarks that the DG ISI would also join the news conference , it stunned journalists present at the auditorium of General Headquarters ( GHQ ) in Rawalpindi . <p> What prompted Gen Nadeem to address the press conference was the brewing political crisis that has engulfed the country since the ouster of former prime minister Imran Khan through a vote of no-confidence in April this year . The killing of prominent journalist Arshad Sharif coupled with Imran 's imminent long march has further deepened the crisis with the establishment once again in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their no holds barred press conference discussed the cypher controversy , the alleged US conspiracy , secret meetings with Imran and the alleged role of the establishment behind Arshad Sharif 's murder . <p> The DG ISI also provided a rare insight into behind-closed-door discussions between the military leadership and the former prime minister . Lt Gen Nadeem made startling revelations that Imran in order to save his government offered Gen Bajwa to continue as the army chief for an indefinite period , which he refused . <p> He went on to add that the real reason behind the former prime minister 's outburst against the military leadership was that Gen Bajwa and his institution refused to play any unconstitutional role . <p> " I know you are shocked to see me amongst yourself , and I can understand your surprise . My policy on my pictures and public appearances has been clear for the past year to which my agency and I strictly adhere to , " Gen Nadeem said . <p> " But today is a different day , I am not here for myself but for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every day for this country . Especially , I have come here for my agency whose officers and agents all over the world protect this country 24 hours a day . <p> " I can not remain silent when they are made targets of uncalled-for criticism on the basis of lies then as the leader of this institution , I can not remain silent . <p> " You should know that this narrative has been 100 per cent constructed on the basis of lies , " the DG ISI said . <p> " But you should know why this narrative was constructed in the first place . Calling someone Mir Jaffar , Mir Sadiq , traitor , neutral and an animal was not because my agency or the army chief was disloyal . It is also not because he army chief did something unconstitutional or unlawful . It is because he , his institution , refused to do something unconstitutional and unlawful " . <p> The DG ISI said the army as an institution last year had taken a considered decision not to get involved in politics . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its constitutional role . This was not an individual decision , this was not just a decision on part of the COAS . It was something that was heavily debated within the institution and we came to the conclusion that the country 's benefit and the institution 's benefit are only in limiting ourselves to our constitutional role " and " getting out of politics " . <p> " Every citizen of Pakistan , irrelevant what their political leaning is , should have their equal right to hold opinions . The institution should not be associated with one group or name . " the intelligence chief added . <p> " Since last year , and especially since March this year , there was a lot of pressure on us , and the pressure was placed in various ways but the institution and army chief decided to stand their ground . " <p> Lt Gen Nadeem further said that the army chief " made this decision for the benefit of the country and sacrificed himself for it " . <p> " In March , the army chief was offered an indefinite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " If you think he is a traitor , then why did you meet him in secret , " questioned DG ISI . <p> " It can not be that you meet the chief in the darkness of the night and express your constitutional and unconstitutional desires , you can express them , that 's fine , but do n't then go out during the day and call him a traitor . " <p> At the outset , the chief military spokesperson questioned the events leading up to senior journalist Arshad Sharif 's murder in Kenya and the narrative that preceded the " unfortunate incident " . <p> The military spokesperson said the purpose of the press conference was to ensure " facts , fiction and opinion can be differentiated " and added that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was also informed regarding the sensitive nature of the media talk . <p> " It is necessary to determine the factors through which a particular narrative was formed and the people were misled , " he added . <p> Regretting that the army chief was also targeted and faced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was made to create a divide in the society " . <p> " The death of Arshad Sharif is an unfortunate incident and we are all deeply saddened by it , he said , adding that Arshad 's family had served in the army and he was an " icon of journalism in Pakistan " . <p> " Arshad Sharif was an icon of Pakistani journalism . Son of a soldier , a martyr 's brother , and the relative of a serving officer , hence , he conveyed the true sense of loss and sincerity in his shows related to the army . " <p> He added that whether it was Siachen , tribal areas , or the Line of Control ( LoC ) , his shows will be remembered as a " role model in the world of journalism " . <p> Lt Gen Iftikhar said as Sharif was an investigative journalist when the issue of the diplomatic cypher arose , the journalist did numerous shows on the issue . <p> " In connection to this , he met the then-prime minister several times and conducted interviews , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have also been shown the minutes of meetings and the cypher . <p> " It is very important to determine the facts regarding the cypher and Arshad Sharif 's death ... to ensure the people know the truth . " <p> The cypher <p> " As far as the cypher is concerned , the army chief himself raised the topic on March 11 at Kamra , to which the former prime minister said it was not a big issue . " <p> He said it was " surprising " for the army when a piece of paper was waived on March 27 and " an attempt was made to build a narrative that was far from reality " . <p> Terming the cypher " baseless and unfounded , " the military spokesperson said the National Security Committee found no proof regarding a conspiracy against the PTI government and neither did the ISI . <p> " This is all part of the record and we wanted these findings to be in front of the people . " <p> The military spokesperson added that it was then left to the then-government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but " that was not done " . <p> " In fact , more rumours and fake news were spread with the aim of gaining political benefits , and a narrative was pushed that the constitutional and legal vote of no confidence was an attempt at regime change . <p> " Pakistan 's institutions , especially the military leadership , were targeted and everything was linked to treason and the regime change operation . " <p> Lt Gen Iftikhar said Arshad Sharif and other journalists were later fed a particular narrative and " an attempt was made to defame Pakistan and the country 's institutions across the world " . <p> He further said that during the " media trial , ARY NEWS channel played the role of a spin doctor in targeting the army and promoting a false narrative " and the NSC meeting was presented in the wrong context . <p> Adding that the military was expected to intervene in domestic politics , he said the words " neutral and apolitical were turned into abuse " . <p> " The army chief and the institution showed restraint and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolve their issues but this did not transpire . " <p> The DG ISI further said that it was also alleged that the cypher " was hidden " . He then asked if such was the case , what action was taken against those who tried to hide the diplomatic communication . <p> " And if no action was taken , why was it not taken and why are they not named ? Twisting around words , spreading fake news , and calling the leadership of institutions traitors , they were then put in the dock . " <p> The military spokesperson , referring to the comments made by the slain journalist earlier against the institution , clarified that the army " did not have any negative sentiments about him Arshad Sharif and there are no such feelings now " . <p> " Many other journalists were also discussing the cypher and remained in Pakistan . They also raised very tough questions , which is their constitutional right . During the entire cypher drama , whenever we talked with any channel , we asked them to not label the institution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to not turn the army 's apolitical stance controversial . " <p> ' Facts ' surrounding Arshad Sharif 's death <p> The DG ISPR said the provincial government of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa ( K-P ) had issued a threat letter on the directives of the provincial executive on August 5 which claimed that the militant Tehreek-e-Taliban ( TTP ) group was planning to target the journalist in Rawalpindi . <p> He added that no information was shared with the federal government or the agencies regarding " who or why " provided the provincial government with the information " . <p> " This implies that the threat alert was issued with a specific thought , which perhaps had the objective of making Arshad Sharif leave the country , " Lt Gen Babar said . <p> " There were reports that he Sharif did not want to leave the country but was constantly reminded that his life was in danger . " <p> Revealing more details , he said that PTI leader Shahbaz Gill , on August 8 , gave a statement on ARY News against the country 's institutions , for which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further added that ARY News senior staffer Ammad Yousaf was also arrested and during the investigation , it was revealed that the CEO of the news channel had asked Ammad to send Arshad abroad following Gill 's arrest . <p> " During this time , a narrative was formed that Arshad Sharif would be murdered abroad . " <p> A ticket for Sharif was booked for Dubai by an employee of ARY Group . " On August 10 , he Arshad Sharif left Peshawar airport through PK-637 for Dubai . During his departure , authorities did not try to stop Arshad Sharif . " <p> The DG ISPR added that the journalist was provided " complete protocol " by the K-P government and Sharif remained in the UAE " until he held a valid visa " . <p> The military spokesperson reiterated that the journalist was not " forced " to leave Dubai at the governmental level and asked who could have urged Arshad Sharif to leave the country . <p> He also questioned who looked after the slain journalist 's stay in the Gulf country and told him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kenya when the visa expired , " Lt Gen Iftikhar and added that there are 34 countries with visas on arrival for Pakistani passports , and questioned why Kenya was chosen as a destination . <p> He raised further questions regarding the journalist 's stay in the east African country and who was hosting him . " Who all was he in contact with within Pakistan and what role Waqar and Khurram Ahmad played in his death ? <p> " Did they know Arshad Sharif from before , or did someone get them in touch ? Some people also claimed meeting Arshad Sharif in London , who were these people , and who asked them to make such claims ? " <p> He further asked if the claims were also part of fake news and the misinformation campaign . <p> " Arshad Sharif died in a faraway place and Kenya police did not recognise him . So who was the first person to get news of his death and by whom ? " <p> " Kenyan police accepted their mistake and it has yet to be examined whether this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Therefore , the government has been requested to form a high-level inquiry commission " . <p> Lt Gen Iftikhar also said that ARY CEO Salman Iqbal " should be brought back to Pakistan " and made a part of the probe as his name has surfaced repeatedly . <p> " It has to be determined who exactly benefited from his Sharif 's killing , " said the military spokesperson as he referred to the finger-pointing at the army . <p> " It 's your responsibility now to unearth the facts and bring them to light . We have to wait for the report from the inquiry commission , " the DG ISPR added that until the report was released , it was not appropriate to make allegations . <p> He also requested the people to " trust their institutions " . <p> " This is your army . If we have made mistakes in the past , we have been washing them with our blood for the past twenty years . We will never fail the people of Pakistan , this is our promise , " said the military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistakes , but can never be a traitor or conspirator . The army is nothing without the people . " <p> Responding to a question regarding criticism of the military and associated press freedoms , the DG ISPR said that " just as Pakistan 's Constitution grants the freedom of expression , it also does not grant the right for character assassination and especially the Pakistani Constitution also does not grant the right to speak against institutions " . <p> " And when somebody does that we have always approached the government . It is not our prerogative to take action , all we can do is request the government . " <p> " There was no danger to the life of Arshad Sharif in Pakistan , " said the DG ISI after he admitted that there may have been " some opposition to his political leanings " . <p> " He was in contact with the establishment and my own institution when he was here and even when he went out of the country he maintained contact . In fact this month , he was in touch and wished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> " We are not fully satisfied " with the Kenyan official 's initial claims that " this was an accident that occurred due to mistaken identity , " he added . <p> Answering a question on possible propaganda against the military in attempts to influence the selection of a new army chief in November , the DG ISPR said that " criticism is everyone 's right " . <p> " We have never had an issue with criticism as an institution . We only have an issue when criticism enters the domain of propaganda and fake news . <p> " That is something we need to avoid because we do n't have a forum where these things can be addressed on a daily basis . Neither does it suit us nor should we do that . That is why the government defends the institutions . But criticism is not an issue . <p> " As far as the selection of the new army chief is concerned , it will happen on time and as per the constitutionally defined method . There should be no doubt about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have already said it is the constitutional right of every Pakistani that they freely express their opinions , even if that opinion is my own criticism and I will repeat this for you : It is my duty to respect that right and as a soldier and spy I am ready to protect that right . You criticise us , by all means , do it day and night , but ask what I did for the country and the nation , not what I did for your or your own political gains . " <p> He added , " If I am not meeting the nation 's expectations then please criticise me . I will happily bring improvement in my work . " <p> " You have a right to an opinion , but do n't manufacture facts , " Lt Gen Nadeem said . <p> Responding to another question about the PTI 's upcoming long march , the spymaster said , " Coming to Islamabad , participating in a long march and protesting is a constitutional right . I do n't think that is a risk to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and assemble somewhere or gather in a constitutional manner , that should not worry anyone , " he continued . <p> " I will tell you this much , we will not allow anyone to destabilise Pakistan , that should be very clear to everyone . " <p> The DG ISI also added that " the Pakistani Constitution grants fundamental rights to its citizens , one of which is the right to protest therefore we should not oppose anyone 's long march , sit-in , or protest " . <p> " The Supreme Court has allowed the government to use whatever resources it has to maintain the law and order situation and what the COAS stated earlier is definitely correct , that he will not allow anyone to bring political or economic instability to the country , " he added . <p> " I have full faith the SC will order clear directives on the matter , but despite that , this danger always stands that when so many people gather then terrorist organisations and other anti-state elements will want to take advantage of it . <p> " It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be that the Pakistan army needs to be called in by Article 245 by the government -- as is its right -- then the military will help the government to control the situation . " <p> When asked about the impact of the former ruling party 's long march on PM Shehbaz 's upcoming foreign visits and how seriously he would be taken when there is " apparent political turmoil " in the country , the DG ISPR said that " all over the world , such upheavals come and go in democracies " . <p> However , he added that " this does not mean that the government in any way holds any less merit , whoever holds the office is the prime minister of Pakistan " . <p> " I do n't think there needs to be too much alarm over it , this happens in democracies , " he said . <p> COMMENTS <p> Replying to X <p> Saved !

Despite the dangers involved , many Pakistani youngsters who want to pursue unconventional professional options are sometimes rejected , resulting in a small number of people choosing such courses . <p> Moreover , despite the fact that no study has thoroughly demonstrated that playing video games causes any of these problems , they have long been linked to aggressive behavior , mass shootings , and destruction . Video games have been found to promote cognitive skills and boost brain capacity , despite what many people think is a clear sign of aggressive inclinations in young people . <p> People 's judgements of gamers and their self-image problems have been influenced by social conceptions of video game players as geeks or loners with few social connections and no social life . Particularly for women , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done to get power . <h> Not enough reliable resources <p> For prospective gamers , a lack of resources , such as a steady broadband connection , access to energy , etc. , has also been a hindrance . <p> To play various online games , Sumail Hassan and Arslan Ash , two of the best players in the Pakistani Esports scene , could not purchase fast internet connections or the necessary gear . <p> Others in Pakistan possess unrivalled skills and a fierce desire to participate in global competitions . However , they can not compete at a higher level due to a lack of financial resources , an unstable internet connection , and power problems . <p> Local servers are a crucial prerequisite that must be met if Esports , and competitive games , in particular , are to flourish in the nation . <h> Not Enough Sponsorship Opportunities <p> The amount of people and businesses investing in Esports has been impacted by the stigma attached to it as a mere pastime . The majority of sponsors are hesitant to contribute to competitions or events despite the availability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often do n't fund or support Pakistani Esports stars or competitions . Instances of local enterprises promoting such local talent are pretty rare . <h> Hardware Permissions <p> With most households earning less , it might be challenging for many to provide three meals daily for their family while still participating in Esports . <p> Esports is an expensive pastime that needs a lot of resources , time , energy , and devotion . Starting an Esports career on a PC might cost between $500 and $3,000 . Costs for consoles like Xbox , PlayStation , and others range from $600 to $1500 . This also discourages most individuals from participating in Esports . <p> In order to promote Esports in Pakistan , it is important that corrective measures are taken bearing in mind the aforementioned factors .

Even after declaring national emergency the relief efforts carried out were not enough to bring the lives of affected back to normal . The damages caused by these floods were estimated to be at $30bn . Some analysts even call these numbers underestimation . The government pronounced 72 out of 160 districts to be Disaster zones . It put the number of people affected at 33 million . The unprecedented monsoon rains and melting glaciers are indicating the worst kind of climate change situation country will be facing in future . <p> On the Human Security Index , Pakistan is ranked at 144th number .

Such understanding of the term security did n't incorporate the internal determinants of security such as ethnic or religious polarization , economic and social grievances , political instability , environmental degradation and low human development index etc . With the evolution of human civilization and emergence of contemporary security frameworks , various strategists emphasized upon the significance and relevance of comprehensive security with modern security frameworks . Resultantly , security policy makers seem to recognize the urgency to include nontraditional security threats in relevant doctrines .

In the book , " The Weaponization of Everything A Field Guide to New of War , " author Mark Galeotti argued that everything related to comprehensive security has become part of war . <p> Pakistan is a country that has always faced the conundrum of balancing between the security of state of Pakistan and its citizens .

The basis of its existence was the preservation of economic and religious rights of the Muslims of subcontinent . But Pakistan became a prisoner of its geographical location . This geo-strategic significance was exploited by the capitalist US against rapacious waves of communist USSR . The naivety of Pakistan 's ruler can be analyzed through the fact that instead of converting their geo-strategic significance into value-added economic and human development , they sought for short term solutions and immediate relief . <p> The statistical evidence shows that economic destabilization would make Pakistan insecure . This argument could be supported by the fact that if economy is growing by 3.0%-3.57% when a country 's population is growing by over 2% then it will be extremely difficult for a state to create economic security is an important determinant of national security .

Thus , it exercises the security strategy from the position of weak . Currently Pakistan needs to focus on human and economical development through good macroeconomic policies , structural reforms , investment in education and health and infrastructure . Then only Pakistan will be able to come out of current economic crisis . <p> Gone are the days of fighting a war in a conventional manner .

It is not a protectorate or a colony much less a slave ; it is a sovereign country free to have its own foreign policy . Pakistan did have a choice , and exercised it freely , sometimes well , sometimes badly . <p> Pakistan independently made a choice to have a foreign policy , especially since Ziaul Haq 's time , that fitted in with the country 's organising idea , which prioritised security over development , the elite over the people , and ideology over progress . This idea was supported by a model of governance , civilian or military , in which institutions came to be seen as subservient to the centres of power and were undermined , weakening the state . <p> A weak state ends up with a dependent foreign policy serving others ' strategic purposes , sometimes even at the expense of its own interests , weakening itself further . <p> The services of Pakistan 's army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the country an attractive partner , for different reasons , to China , the US and Saudi Arabia that became its principal benefactors . Given the multiplicity and relative permanence of interests that bind China and Pakistan that relationship became strategic , serving us well . But the other two remained largely transactional , the plinth of mutual interests being small and shifting , and Pakistan 's services more important than the country itself , and useful only when needed . <p> A dependent foreign policy is restrictive and addictive , robbing the country of the freedom to find new allies . It is also a disincentive to developing one 's own national strength . It made Islamabad complacent that being geopolitically too important , a nuclear power too risky to fail , and its services too indispensable , Pakistan did not need to diversify its friends or develop its own strength . This made it vulnerable to exploitation . <p> A weak state ends up with a foreign policy serving others ' interests . <p> The elites ' hold over national interests , geared to the pursuit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with big powers finding it less costly to satisfy the elites ' than Pakistan 's interests . Pakistan also benefited but lost more than it gained . Conspiracy theories or not , the people have now rejected this bargain . <p> In the light of national history of the past few decades , Pakistan 's establishment needs to do some serious soul-searching about the country 's place in the world . The latter faces new geopolitics , new rising powers , new regional alignments , new alliances , an increase in nontraditional threats and transnational challenges -- and , at the same time , unforeseen opportunities . <p> National priorities globally have come to focus on the economy . To reap economic benefits , countries -- while strengthening or loosening their traditional ties -- are seeking new friendships and multiplying relationships . <p> Washington , too , may have realised that its policy to isolate China , create blocs and focus only on great power rivalry and confrontation has not worked . And that the strategic competition with Beijing has to be managed responsibly without armed conflict or economic warfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French President Macron emphasised in a speech to business executives at the APEC summit in Bangkok that " we need a single global order " , a view echoed by German Chancellor Scholz separately . According to IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva , " We are in a world that is going from one shock to another -- pandemic , war , inflation , cost of living crisis . And if we add on top of it the fragmentation in the world economy , it would be throwing gasoline on a fire . " <p> In a changed strategy , the US may now be engaging with Pakistan as part of its broader interests in South Asia , that are geopolitical , reg ? ional and security related . Some interests will be served by India , some by Pakistan , and some by both like in the Indo-Pacific strategy .

@@95391233 <p> IN recent years , climate diplomacy has become important for countries like Pakistan that are surrounded by a challenging security environment and changing climate . <p> As recently observed at the 27th climate summit held in Sharm El Sheikh in Egypt , it has helped Pakistan re-engage with the world community , project its gentler image , leverage its soft power , develop a business case for the country , and broker a global consensus to support climate-vulnerable countries . <p> Are there any lessons that Pakistan can bring home to South Asia ? <p> Climate diplomacy has over the years evolved its own characteristics that are not always witnessed in traditional diplomacy . The latter has traditionally hinged on secrecy , suspicion and surprise . It is often marked by win-lose relationships that were typically prisoner to zero-sum calculations . Further , traditional diplomacy is built on Intelligence ( with a capital ' I ' ) , technology , weapon systems and military strategy , supported by a combination of covert and overt actions , etc . In pursuit of stable relationships , crisis management techniques are employed for predictability in relations and system stability . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its scope and complexity . It has evolved into a distinct branch of diplomacy that defies several precepts of traditional diplomacy . It seeks regional cooperation by embracing all nontraditional threats to security . In fact , regional cooperation paves the way for addressing nontraditional threats by applying the evolving principles of climate diplomacy . Or to put it differently , nontraditional security threats enable regional cooperation that was seldom the case with traditional security . In the climate change context , traditional responses can be counterproductive . Nontraditional responses can help regional cooperation flourish . <p> Further , regional cooperation and nontraditional threats are rarely entirely domestic or inter-state . Climate issues spill over from national to regional to international boundaries . <p> As chair of the Group of 77 plus China , the climate summit provided Pakistan an opportunity to lead a grouping of 134 countries , including formal sub-groups like the 46 Least Developed Countries , and the 40 Small Island Developing Countries . Pakistan also engaged with many overlapping groups such as the 58-country Climate Vulnerability Forum , 46 African countries , and V-20 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Afghanistan , Bangladesh and Nepal . <p> Climate diplomacy is driven by faith in prolonged engagement in complex processes . <p> As chair of the G-77 plus China , Pakistan brought on the table the world 's largest economies and emitters , the US , EU , China and India . This was a remarkable feat for a country that otherwise follows an India-centric foreign policy and has relegated other global engagements to the secondary level since the 1992 Rio Summit when , coincidentally , Pakistan was chairing G-77 plus China under the able chairmanship of Jamsheed Marker . Pakistan 's experience of conducting climate diplomacy has provided it with exposure to new , innovative approaches for conducting regional climate diplomacy . <p> Climate diplomacy has evolved , as was witnessed in various climate and other multilateral environmental agreements by eschewing zero-sum calculations and by building win-win options . <p> Most importantly , climate diplomacy is driven by faith in prolonged engagement in complex processes , always supported by the latest scientific knowledge available to all in the open space of the knowledge marketplace . It has found innovative ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the private sector , entrepreneurs , women , children , indigenous people and others , and used their creativity to avoid deadlocks in negotiations . <p> A set of new nontraditional threats to security have emerged in South Asia that redefine the India-Pakistan relationship . Regional cooperation and its scope are at a crossroads , while we are still struggling with the resolution of the Kashmir dispute and arbitrary interpretations of the Indus Waters Treaty . The list of nontraditional security threats is steadily unfolding . Presently , it is topped by fluctuations in river flows , the air quality that has engulfed both Delhi and Lahore , in addition to the changing patterns of monsoon and rainfall trends , and cloudbursts causing cross-border flash floods . <p> The long-term trends of seawater intrusion , tropical storms , droughts and desertification , epidemics and pandemics , and transborder migration and regional refugees are the new issues that demand space on our bilateral agenda . The frequency of climate-induced disasters has made the border trade of fruit , vegetables and some commodities more of a climate risk management subject rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues will aggravate as the global temperature increases further towards 1.5 degrees Celsius and beyond . <p> The UN Security Council has since 2007 begun to accept that climate change poses a threat to international peace and security . It has accepted several nontraditional threats that are rooted in disputes over water , ecosystems and environmental issues such as the Lake Chad Basin crisis , women 's vulnerability in conflicts , human trafficking , etc in UNSC resolutions 2348 , 1325 , and 2331 . The UNSC sees climate crisis adding new dimensions to conflicts such as the Sudan war in Darfur ( since 2003 ) , the Somali civil war ( 2009 ) , insurgency in Nigeria ( 2009 ) , Syria 's civil war ( 2011 ) and the Mali conflict ( 2012 ) . In fact , public unrest following flooding in Thailand and Myanmar in 2011 and 2017 was attributed to climate change . No credible studies exist to link unrest in Afghanistan and Balochistan with prolonged droughts . <p> Given the widespread monsoon disruptions that have begun to occur , as evident in Pakistan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest of both Pakistan and India to agree to do their utmost to halt global temperature change at 1.5 ? C. Pakistan needs to engage with both India and China , the world 's second and third largest emitters , bilaterally and as a group leading to COP28 in Dubai next year . <p> Going forward , the momentum created at Sharm El Sheikh can not be maintained with the present weak institutional capacities . A clear strategic understanding needs to be strengthened in ' whole-of-government ' particularly in the climate , foreign , planning , finance and sectoral ministries . This is a window of opportunity for Pakistan to put in place institutional mechanisms to engage India and other neighbours in climate diplomacy . <p> The global discourse on carbon markets and trading , carbon capture and sequestration , shift towards non-combustion engine vehicles and long-lasting batteries , phasing out of coal and fossil fuels , blue and green hydrogen energy clearly indicates that climate diplomacy has moved beyond the narrow confines of UNFCC processes .

If there is a strategy , it is waiting for someone to invade Afghanistan to extract geopolitical rents from them . <p> Underlying these decades-long challenges is a fundamentally changing society . For one : over the next 28 years , Pakistan will add about 132 million more people above its current population size . Pakistanis also now live increasingly in urban areas which reshapes how people interact with each other -- opening new avenues for collective action and greater demand for public services .

This is a fundamental constraint in Pakistan 's growth model : nothing short of a complete break from the current trajectory will work . <p> Today Pakistan is on the brink again . While a sovereign default is unlikely , what is clear is that Pakistan 's survival once again depends solely on the generosity of its few allies . This generosity might be eventually forthcoming allowing us to kick the bucket down the road for a few months -- but then what ? What happens a few months from now when once again we need more money to pay for imports or service our debt ? <p> We need a radical break . There must be an immediate realization that the current economic system neither delivers growth for its citizens nor is stable enough to be maintained .

A different pathway requires a pro-growth coalition that pushes for reforms that can make real gains in Pakistan 's productive capacity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest three actions . First : Pakistan must disincentive the capital stuck in real estate . Putting a large chunk of domestic savings into real estate takes capital away from sectors that can contribute towards exports ( plots ca n't be exported , alas ) . A great way to do this is by levying an annual tax on urban land . Not only would this raise revenue for public services but help allocate capital towards tradable sectors . <p> Second : We need deliberate and significant efforts to improve female labour market participation . Currently , only two out of 10 adult women are in the labour market ; this is below countries of similar income levels . One way to do so is by investing in urban transport systems that would disproportionately benefit women as they face the highest mobility barriers . <p> Third : Pakistan should reduce policy-induced market distortions that are often in place to benefit vested interests . One example are the import duties that incentivize firms to sell domestically rather than attempt to innovate and compete abroad ( a recent report by the World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the profitability of selling domestically as opposed to exporting by 40 per cent ) . By making the market a level playing field , we can incentivize firms to innovate and compete globally . <p> Pakistan is on a path to the abyss .

The latest UN report suggests that an estimated eight million people in Pakistan are still potentially exposed to floodwater or living close to flooded areas . It is normal for rainwater to pass through Sindh to flow down the Indus . But the process has been rather slow , and the government has not taken any significant steps -- digging and dredging -- to let water drain out quickly . On top of it , people in the worst-affected districts -- Badin , Benazirabad , Dadu , Jaffarabad , Jamshoro , Kambar , Khairpur , and Mirpurkhas -- are also not sure what they will do when the weather turns chilly . <p> The UN has also expressed that the problems of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperatures start to drop .

A month ago , at a climate conference attended by the world 's richest , Pakistan took centre stage .

Pakistan has so far received $816 million or 23 per cent of the budget approved under the Floods Response Plan .

The National Counter-Terrorism Authority ( Nacta ) seems to agree , and has said that the TTP managed to gain considerable ground during the peace talks between the outlawed militant group and the government . The fact that the TTP has been able to increase its foothold while using peace talks as a ruse has become evident from their attacks and visible presence in the bordering districts with Afghanistan . Pakistan has recently been seeing an upsurge in the magnitude of the activities that the militants have been carrying out . The rising terror incidents in the country have once again made the bordering districts vulnerable to attacks and it may not be long before they are able to strike at will anywhere in the country . <p> After using the peace talks as camouflage , the TTP called off the ceasefire agreement with the government in November . The militants have been sabotaging peace in this region for long -- each time using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are blaming the Pakistani state for attacking them . The TTP would like everyone to believe that it is just staging ' retaliatory attacks ' but the reality is that the group has been violating ceasefires for over a decade . The talks that Pakistan officials held with the militant outfit were mysterious and opaque and even then the negotiations broke down in August due to a deadlock on the revocation of the merger of the erstwhile tribal areas with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa . <p> Luckily , in the face of increasing TTP presence , local residents of these areas took it upon themselves to raise a voice against militancy . Their voice -- clear and unambiguous -- was heard loud and clear . The Nacta report also maintains that US withdrawal from Afghanistan last year gave the TTP impetus to strike again . The rise in the terrorism index should be alarming for the government of Pakistan . There is no room for any complacency . If militant attacks are to be stopped , it can not be through purely defensive measures at the scene of the attack . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suicide bombers but can not stop them . The work needs to be done before the attacks take place , with good intelligence giving us the opportunity to thwart the attacks .

Winning on the battlefield alone will not be sufficient either . To prevent new militant threats from rising up , it is their ideology which must be discredited .

Most people who fall in this category depend on their salaries as their sole means of income . And while prices have risen , their incomes have not . Nonetheless , a middle-class person has to keep up appearances . He must keep wearing the right clothes , buying the right furniture , having the right phone and sending his children to the right schools . Cheaper alternatives risk ruining social capital , a more valuable currency among the middle-class than dollars . It is both ironic and a little sad that a shop owner with no educational background is probably out earning most of the salaried men and women with their expensive degrees . Perhaps it is time for the middle class to rethink its value system . Nice clothes and fancy schools count for naught if you ca n't pay the bills .

@@95623240 <h> Cops and corruption <p> December 12 , 2022 <p> There are a variety of reasons why the Pakistani police force is considered one of the most corrupt institutions in the country . First , there is a lack of accountability and transparency within the system . Police officers are often not held accountable for their actions , and allegations of bribery and extortion are common . Additionally , police officers are mostly paid very poorly and face awful working conditions , which can incentivize them to accept bribes in order to make extra money . <p> Furthermore , the lack of proper training and resources available to the police force can lead to corruption and inefficiency . Finally , a lack of public trust and confidence in the police force further contributes to its reputation as one of the most corrupt departments in Pakistan . If we want better policing , the government will have to invest more in training , equipping and paying our police officers .

He said that the Punjab Counter Terrorism Department ( CTD ) had busted a terrorist cell involved in the powerful explosion and the investigation revealed that the Research and Analysis Wing ( RAW ) ' s operatives had facilitated and financed it to carry out the terrorist activity . " This case is such a reference that the incumbent government has decided to present it before the international community and place our stance before the world to expose the terrorist face of India , " interior minister said here while addressing a joint press conference along with Punjab CTD 's Additional Inspector General Imran Mehmood .

Rana Sanaullah said that this was the second incident after arrest and confessional statement of Indian spy Kulbhushan Jadhav which was a proof that India had been found involved behind any form of terrorism in Pakistan in one way or the other . Terming that the matter was related to Pakistan 's internal security , he further said that the nighbouring country was only doing this to justify and hide its atrocities being committed in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir .

A three-member special bench of the apex court headed by Chief Justice Umar Ata Bandial and comprising Justice Ijaz ul Ahsan and Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah conducted hearing of the constitutional petition of PTI Chairman Imran Khan against the amendments in the NAO 1999 . During the hearing , Justice Ijaz said that the legislation was rushed through , as there was no discussion on the NAB amendments bill , and the legislators were not aware of its motives and objective . The Chief Justice remarked that would it be called parliamentary capture . However , Kh Haris said it should be called regulatory capture because they are making laws , which benefit them . Justice Mansoor questioned what was the rank of Pakistan in terms of corruption all over the world when the original law was enforced ? Justice Ijaz said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another 100 places . Justice Mansoor said to the counsel that you are saying that through these amendments , which the parliament has passed , the corruption has enhanced , therefore , the court revive the old law . The Chief Justice noted that the corruption also exists in the neighbouring country . We are not investigation and do not have expertise . He said that since the establishment of the National Accountability Bureau ( NAB ) in 1999 the corruption still persists in the country . Even the judiciary has failed to curb this menace though in many judgments proposed steps to control it . He said that in Pakistan Steel Mills and Reko Diq cases the judgments were passed in good faith , but the subsequent executive failed to implement them . It is not the matter of punishment , but the system needs to curb the corruption.The Chief Justice further said that many businesses collapsed due to the NAB law , and the businessmen have shifted their commercial activities in other countries . The NAB law was misused . He said the media is outspoken against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journalists ' rights . He remarked that corruption can not be eradicated in the country until the flaws in the system are removed . Justice Ijaz said that the members of political parties have to follow the orders of their party leaders and vote to the laws , which benefit to those , whose corruption cases are in the courts . The legislation ( amendments ) has benefited a few persons . He questioned should the judiciary sit behind and watch and do not interfere when the system is collapsing ? Justice Mansoor again questioned why the army is not coming to the fold of NAB . He asked the counsel that you have built your case that everyone should be held accountable . Then why the Armed Forces are excluded , what the courts do about Article 25 of the Constitution . Kh Haris replied that according to the definition in Section 5(n) ( iv ) of NAO the Armed Forces are not covered under the NAB law . He said that they are not totally excluded , however , they were given exemptions by a larger bench of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bench to revisit this judgment , so it will be clear to us . Justice Mansoor said that the Armed Forces can have protection when they are running the institution , but the question is if an individual commits an act of corruption then would he too be exempted ? Is it not discriminatory ? The judge noted that the judgment in Asfandyar Wali was passed in 2001 during the regime of Pervez Musharraf . Kh Haris said that it was the judgment of the Supreme Court and therefore they should not be blamed for this .

We can mimic developed countries in talk , but we ca n't do the same in practice unless we improve the lot of the marginalized . <p> Every year International Minorities Rights Day is observed on Dec 18 to uphold the right to freedom and equal opportunities for minorities across the world . In 1992 , the United Nations declared this day and adopted the statement on individuals ' rights -- for ethnic , linguistic , national , or religious minorities . The day tries to promote dignity and respect for minority groups and highlights the challenges and issues the minority communities of diverse origins have been facing . <p> When Prof Sagar Samejo and Chandar Keswani called from Karachi inviting me to speak at the festival-and-seminar they were organizing , I was a bit reluctant due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apologies . The Forum for Rights of Marginalized Communities ( FRMC ) has been trying to highlight the issues minority communities have been facing in Pakistan .

Sagar himself is a son of the Thar desert where life can be both adorable and pitiful . Like most other children in that area , Sagar received his primary education from his village 's open-air school . Through sheer hard work , he went on to acquire an MSc in chemistry from Sindh University . <p> This background helps us understand how some people overcome all obstacles to achieve academic excellence , and then do not confine themselves to personal gains . Sagar has been an activist from his college days and thanks to his love for democracy and progressive politics he could join the ranks of those who challenged Gen Ziaul Haq 's military dictatorship . He ended up in jail and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participation in the Movement for Restoration of Democracy in the 1980s is exemplary . His literary quests also groomed him as a fine Sindhi poet and short-story writer . <p> Through the efforts of Gianchand and Sagar Samejo -- with full support from Culture and Education Minister Syed Sardar Ali Shah and senior PPP leader Nisar Khuhro -- the festival and seminar became a huge success . Gianchand himself is an engineer from Umarkot and was only the second Dalit to become senator of Pakistan on a PPP ticket in 2015 . Credit must go to the PPPas it sent the first Hindu woman Ratna Bhagwandas Chawla to the Senate of Pakistan in 2006 , and then the first Dalit woman Krishna Kohli in 2018 . <p> Though minority issues get some highlights here and there , the most marginalized seldom get any attention .

A policy of non-discrimination at all levels that the state must enforce and every tier of government must implement is perhaps the only way forward . The theme by the UN for 2022 was ' All in 4 Minority Rights ' . Though some people take exception to the use of the word ' minorities ' for cultural or religious communities , this is an accepted term by the UN . <p> Though there is no universal definition of minority , a community that lacks influence economically , politically and socially , and whose population is negligible is usually called a minority .

This is where another problem creeps in about the definition of Hindus whose major population centres are Hyderabad and Mirpurkhas divisions where nearly half of them reside . Many Dalit community members identify themselves as a distinct group of scheduled castes which they claim is different from Hindus . <p> At the seminar , Chief Guest Sherry Rehman took strong exception to the words ' minority ' and ' scheduled castes ' .

What is more surprising is that in Sindh and Balochistan the desire for more respect outweighed the urge for better income as the main reason behind wishing to leave the country . <p> The breakdown further shows that in Sindh more respondents chose the reason to move out of Pakistan for more or better security . In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa , gender equality and biological basis for identity were major reasons behind the wish to move out of Pakistan . <p> A somewhat similar survey by Gallup Pakistan in June last year concluded that 26 per cent Pakistanis wished to move abroad as opposed to 70 per cent Pakistanis who felt connected to the country and preferred to live and work in Pakistan .

Another alarming aspect is that it is not the need to improve one 's economic future alone that is traditionally behind migration .

The bronze statues show hollowed men with huge portions of body parts missing carrying a briefcase that is both weighing them down and also their only means of support -- serving as poignant reminders of the individual cost of migration . <p> To unpack the desire of more young Pakistanis wishing to migrate from Pakistan , the youth 's growing alienation with Pakistan and its present and future must also be analyzed .

@@95906238 <h> Going nuclear <p> On December 13 , the US Department of Energy ( DOE ) announced that the National Ignition Facility ( NIF ) at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory had reached a " milestone " : the achievement of " ignition " in nuclear fusion earlier in the month . That announcement was hailed by many as a step into a fossil fuel-free energy future . US Senate majority leader Charles Schumer , for example , claimed that we were " on the precipice of a future no longer reliant on fossil fuels but instead powered by new clean fusion energy " . <p> But in truth , generating electrical power from fusion commercially or at an industrial scale is likely unattainable in any realistic sense , at least within the lifetimes of most readers of this article . At the same time , this experiment will contribute far more to US efforts to further develop its terrifyingly destructive nuclear weapons arsenal . <p> Over the last decade or so , there have been many similar announcements featuring breathless language about breakthroughs , milestones , and advances . These statements have come with unfailing regularity from NIF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set of laboratories and commercial firms pursuing the idea of nuclear fusion . Apart from the United States , similar announcements have come from Germany , China and the United Kingdom . France is expected to take its turn once the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor ( ITER ) starts operating . The reactor is currently being built in Cadarache , France , at an estimated cost of somewhere between $25 billion to as high as $65 billion , much higher than the original estimate of $5.6 billion . <p> These incredibly high costs also explain why such announcements are made in the first place : without the excitement created by these hyped-up statements , it would be impossible to get funded for the decades it takes to plan and build these facilities . Conceptual design work on ITER began in 1988 . <p> Of course , that timescale pales in comparison to the time period of the first major announcement about fusion-generated electricity . That took place in 1955 when Homi Bhabha , the architect of India 's nuclear programme , told the first International Conference on Peaceful Uses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predict that a method will be found for liberating fusion energy in a controlled manner within the next two decades . When that happens the energy problems of the world will have been solved forever . " <p> That would not be the last prediction about the imminence of fusion power that would be wrong . <p> Three challenges for nuclear fusion : The recent " breakthrough " that NIF announced pertains to what I would term " physics challenges " . One can identify three stages of physics challenges . <p> The first challenge is to have enough fusion reactions in the pellet that is blasted by lasers to produce more energy than is put into the target . That was what seems to have been seen at NIF : the reports say that the lasers pumped in 2.05 megajoules of energy and about 3.15 megajoules came out . All of this over a time period of a few nanoseconds ( a nanosecond is one billionth of a second ) . The figure of 3.15 megajoules might seem like a lot but it is only 0.875 kilowatt-hours , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of electricity if it was used to boil water and drive a turbine . ( For comparison , a rooftop solar panel that costs under Rs 30,000 in Delhi could generate around 5,000 times more electrical energy in a year . ) <p> The second physics challenge is to produce more energy than is used by the facility as a whole . NIF is far from meeting this challenge . It admitted that just the 192 lasers consumed around 400 megajoules in the process of blasting the pellet . To this , we have to add all the energy that goes into running the other equipment and the facility as a whole . <p> The final physics challenge is to produce more energy than what is required to construct the facility and all the equipment . In the case of the ITER experiment , for example , it has been estimated that " the tokamak itself will weigh as much as three Eiffel towers and the total weight of the central ITER facility is around 400,000 tons " . As Daniel Jassby , a retired physicist from the Princeton Plasma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear on the negative side of the energy accounting ledger " . <p> If these physics challenges are not met , of course , then one has a permanent loss-making facility in energy terms . NIF is far from meeting the latter challenges . <p> The next stage can be called an " engineering challenge " and that revolves around the question : how do you convert this experimental set up that produces energy for a microscopic fraction of a second into a continuous source of electricity that operates 24 hours a day and 365 days per year ? To do that , these fusion reactions should occur several times each second , each second of the day , each day of the year . As of now , the lasers can fire only once a day , at a single target . To move from that state to what is required will need an improvement by a factor of over 500,000 ( assuming around six shots per second ) . <p> But it is not just firing the laser . Each of these explosions produces a large amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then a new pellet has to be placed with utmost precision at the very spot where the lasers can focus their beams . <p> If all of this is not trouble enough , there is fuel procurement . NIF uses a " gold cylinder with a frozen pellet of the hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium " . Deuterium and tritium are isotopes of hydrogen . Deuterium is quite common but tritium is very scarce , because it decays radioactively with a half-life of only around 12 years . Fusion proponents often talk about generating tritium in situ , but this is an exceedingly difficult task , as Jasby has explained . <p> Even if one were to adopt the approach of watching superhero movies and willingly suspend disbelief to assume that all these engineering challenges are solved , then there is an even more difficult challenge : to make this incredibly complicated process into an economically competitive way of generating electricity . If one goes by history , the last could be a killer as has been the case with nuclear fission power , which is a far easier process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

This means Pakistan 's possible contender for the Oscars will be a film most in the country will not have seen . Again , it is unfortunate just how inevitable this reaction was . Joyland explores a family 's self-discovery amidst a relationship between a man and a transgender woman . Needless to say , just the mere humanizing of a transgender person seemed to have led to the kind of outrage normally reserved for far greater transgressions . The concept of opting to not watch a film if one disagrees with the content seems to still elude the morality police in the country . The film had to have been released in its home country to be able to vie for an Oscar , which is why there is some mercy in the fact that it was released at least by the federal government and Sindh . Here 's hoping the new year brings an Oscar win for Pakistan . <p> Joyland is not alone in its Oscar bid . Following the Joyland news came word that another film , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time -- that not only features a Pakistani subject but also has Pakistani producers and a Pakistani crew and is shot in Pakistan has also been shortlisted for the or the Oscars in the Documentary Short Film category . The documentary looks at the largely unexplored world of Pakistan 's Special Olympics programme through the stories of three teenagers in Sindh , all three with intellectual challenges . The documentary has won an award for Best Documentary Short at the 2022 Woodstock Film Festival . All this is due to the perseverance of Pakistan 's creative industry -- actors , filmmakers , producers , singers , artists -- that continues work amidst a shortage of funds , support , and even appreciation . Much more is needed to support the country 's artists so that no group can just decide that it has the right to dictate what can and can not be screened on our TV or theatre screens .
