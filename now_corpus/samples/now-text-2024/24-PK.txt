This speech is entirely hypothetical . Reformistan and Prime Minister Arsh are entirely fictional and bear no relation to real-world events . This speech is a creative exercise for illustrative purposes . <p> The intent is to inspire constructive dialogue about comprehensive economic models and their potential impact on national development . The speech is based on ' The PIDE Reform Agenda for Accelerated and Sustained Growth ' aiming for reform for accelerated prosperity and inclusive development ( RAPID ) : <p> Fellow citizens of Reformistan , my brothers and sisters ! As your newly elected prime minister , I bring to you a vision to transform Reformistan , a vision for sustained growth , equity and prosperity through transformative change . <p> Imagine ! Rather be sure that in the next half-decade , Reformistan will stand tall as a global leader in innovation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vibrant hubs of opportunity , fostering creativity , inclusivity , and prosperity for every citizen .

The public and private sectors will collaborate seamlessly , creating a dynamic ecosystem that spurs economic growth and job creation . In five years , Reformistan will not just be a country ; it will be a model -- a model of good governance , sustainability , and social harmony . Let 's go a bit deep ! Let 's get real ! Now , I will present not just a vision but a comprehensive blueprint for Reformistan 's economic transformation -- ' RAPID ' . <p> The core principle of RAPID is rooted in the understanding that our youth , our greatest asset , must find gainful employment , and our economic trajectory must ensure debt sustainability . To achieve this , we do not merely aim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate of 7-9 per cent per annum for the next three decades . <p> This growth rate is not a mere aspiration , it is our lifeline . But achieving it demands a departure from the current norm , a shift in the way we approach governance , economics , and societal progress . RAPID is our commitment to break away from the shackles of the past and surge into a future where prosperity is not just a dream but a reality . <p> The success of RAPID hinges on redefining the role of the state . We envisage a government that is not a hindrance but an enabler -- an enabler of innovation , investment , and individual enterprise . Our institutions will be the bedrock of progress , reformed to enhance productivity and propel investment . <p> Markets are the pulse of our economy , and RAPID recognizes the need for vibrant and competitive markets . We will liberate our markets from the burdensome hand of excessive regulation , allowing them to breathe , innovate , and thrive . The result-based management framework will revolutionize public investments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the engines of economic growth , and RAPID seeks to unleash their potential . By rethinking regulations around zoning , construction , and public spaces , we aim to create urban centres that are hubs of innovation , inclusivity , and economic dynamism . <p> Embracing technology is not an option , it is a necessity . RAPID positions Reformistan at the forefront of technological innovation . We will invest in universal internet access , fostering an environment where creativity and problem-solving skills thrive , propelling us into the future . <p> To ensure efficiency , we propose a decentralized governance model . Policy formulation , monitoring , and evaluation will be the focus of the federal government , while independent regulatory agencies ensure fair play . Service delivery , vital for our citizens , will be in the capable hands of local governments , close to the people they serve . <p> RAPID includes comprehensive tax reforms designed to make our tax system more progressive , transparent , and efficient . By curbing tax breaks for the elite and ensuring a buoyant tax regime , we aim to mobilize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt sustainability are non-negotiable . RAPID asserts that sustained growth is the key to overcoming these challenges . While we anticipate hurdles , we commit to adaptability , ensuring our reforms remain aligned with our overarching goal . <p> In pursuit of a transformative vision for our nation , comprehensive reforms in the education sector are essential . The focus must shift towards quality education , equipping students with both foundational knowledge and practical skills necessary for the complexities of the 21st century . The reform agenda encompasses not only an overhaul of curricula to include modern technical skills but also emphasizes the cultivation of soft skills such as critical thinking , creativity , and effective communication . <p> To reduce poverty and vulnerability , the government shall provide income support to only vulnerable societies . It will design multifaceted graduation programmes to create opportunities for the poor to establish micro-enterprises and engage in productive employment .

I would also like to extend an earnest invitation to all political parties , stakeholders , and citizens to join hands in this transformative journey for Reformistan . <p> The challenges we face are not partisan , they are challenges to the very fabric of our nation . In the spirit of unity and shared responsibility , I propose the establishment of a RAPID reform council , a body that transcends political lines and puts the interests of Reformistan first . <p> I am honoured to extend an invitation to the opposition leader to co-chair this council alongside me .

But the government 's zero-tolerance approach towards the issue can help it fight against all odds . The country had a remarkable success in containing the Covid-19 virus , vaccinating a majority of the population in the shortest time possible . It can definitely fight against polio too . All the government needs is to define its targets clearly and implement the plan without giving anyone any concessions .

Will we be better off in the coming year ? Is the best we can do simply to hope and pray ? Or can we more actively contribute to the change and betterment of things ? Is it only the political leaders that are important , not even the symbolic kings and queens , opinion leaders and the media ?

We will also have to reduce structural inequalities in all countries as we live in a time with inflation and high prices .

@@105178233 <h> Email <p> To stay within the 266 seat-limit for the National Assembly , there has been some ' creative ' redrawing of constituency boundaries , which in certain cases give particular parties a definite edge over their rivals in the area . <p> With each passing day , the Election Commission of Pakistan ( ECP ) and political parties are achieving election-related milestones , even though uncertainty still shrouds the prospects of polls on Feb 8 . While the commission has allotted symbols and parties have announced their candidates , none of the endeavours have been without contention . <p> Arguably , the most contentious of all processes was delimitation carried out late last year . The roots of the widespread discontent surrounding the exercise stemmed from a meeting held in August 2023 . <p> Four days before it dissolved the National Assembly on August 9 , 2023 , the coalition Pakistan Democratic Movement ( PDM ) government convened the Council of Common Interests to approve the results of the 2023 digital census . <p> The move effectively shut the door on the prospects of elections within the 90-day constitutional limit as the Election Commission of Pakistan ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The compulsion was due to the stipulation laid down in Article 51(5) of the Constitution which states , " The seats in the National Assembly shall be allocated to each Province and the Federal Capital on the basis of population in accordance with the last preceding census officially published . " <p> While delimitation of constituencies is a fairly routine exercise , it was different this time around for one reason : there was no elected government in power during the process . In the absence of a National Assembly , the total number of seats could n't be modified as it requires a constitutional amendment , which again , ca n't be done without an elected lower house of the Parliament . <p> So even though the population increased from 207.7 million in 2017 to 241.5m in 2023 , the number of general seats in the National Assembly had to remain the same -- 266 -- as provided under Article 51(3) of the Constitution . <p> According to the final delimitations published by the ECP , the total general seats in NA were 266 .

This was done in line with the 25th constitutional amendment which merged the tribal districts with KP . <p> According to Lehaz Ali , a Peshawar-based journalist who has extensively covered politics in KP , the reduction in the seats of erstwhile Fata was the result of " population rationalisation " . <p> " Former Fata had 12 seats till 2018 elections . Since it was an underprivileged area , it was given more seats compared to its population . Now Fata is part of KP , and their seat distribution has been bought at par with the remaining parts of the province .

The total population of Lahore is then divided by 14 , to arrive at 928,866 -- the population of each constituency in the district . <p> This number of constituents for each NA varies for every district across the country . <p> It is important to note that while marking each constituency , the ECP keeps a lower and upper margin of 0.5 fraction or five per cent . It means that a constituency can be carved with a population that is 5pc less or 5pc more than the pre-determined number of constituents . For example , in the case of Lahore district , the 5pc vacation comes at 46,443 , so , each constituency in the district can be created with a lower population limit of 882,423 or an upper limit of 975,309 . <h> The discontent <p> The ECP notified preliminary delimitation or Form 5 on September 27 , 2023 , and published the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It then invited objections on preliminary delimitation till Oct 27 . <p> A total of 1,327 representations , or objections , were filed over the preliminary delimitation .

It now includes major chunks of Gujranwala Cantt and Saddar areas . <p> Interestingly , Hafizabad district had a population of 1,319,909 , according to the 2023 census , making it eligible for a separate NA seat . Despite the fact that Hafizabad had a separate seat in 2018 , in the preliminary delimitation for 2023 , the district was split into two constituencies : NA-67 Hafizabad and NA-81 Gujranwala-cum-Hafizabad .

The single seat of the ex-Orakzai agency has been merged with Hangu to form NA-36 Hangu-cum-Orakzai . The lone seat of North Waziristan has been retained and the two of South Waziristan have been merged to form NA-42 South Waziristan Upper-cum-South Waziristan Lower . <p> In other regions , the previous Chitral district has been divided into two : Upper Chitral and Lower Chitral , with both included in one constituency . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mainland 's share of 39 seats remained intact . <p> In KP , there have been concerns over delimitation in the major centres , especially for provincial assembly seats . <p> According to Mr Ali , areas in Charsadda where Aftab Sherpao and his son , Sikandar Sherpao , had a majority have been lumped into one constituency . In Nowshera , constituencies for the KP Assembly have been created in line with the preferences of Pervez Khattak , he notes . " A similar trend has been witnessed in Mardan , Bannu and D.I . Khan . <p> He explained that KP can be divided into four regions : central , southern , Malakand and Hazara . The central region , which includes Peshawar , Mardan , Charsaddar , Nowhsera , Swabi , Khyber and Mohmand represents over 40pc of the province 's population and is the centre of power . " My analysis of the past four elections shows that the party which wins central KP forms government with support from other parties . " <p> In Peshawar and its surrounding areas , the PTI won the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties " , Mr Ali says , adding that in light of this , one provincial assembly seat was subtracted from Peshawar 's tally and reallocated to Shangla , apparently to " benefit someone else " . <h> Balochistan ' underprivileged and underrepresented ' <p> In the province with the largest and most sprawling constituencies , the delimitation of seats reflects its glaring underrepresentation in the NA . In 2018 , Balochistan had the lowest population among all four provinces , and so was its quota of 771,546 people for each NA seat . <p> In 2023 , the province still had the lowest population among all four provinces , but its per seat quota of 930,900 has now become the highest . <p> Talking about delimitation in Balocsihtan , Akbar Notezai , who has extensively reported on the province 's politics , said gerrymandering in Balochistan has been going on for decades , with underrepresentation being a long-standing grievance of the province 's political leaders . <p> He recalled that in the 70s , the province had only four general seats in the NA . " Balochistan does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> While population-wise these constituencies have far lower constituents than other parts of the province , they span over huge swathes due to the merger of several districts . <p> Mr Notezai pointed out that Balochistan 's population has increased , but it has n't resulted in a proportionate increase in seats , resulting in the merger of several districts to reach the population quota for each constituency . <p> An example of this merger is NA-260 **39;479;TOOLONG . Its estimated area is 98,596 sq km , as per the 2017 census . For comparison , all south Punjab districts , Bahawalpur , Bahawalnagar , Rahim Yar Khan , Multan , Lodhran , Khanewal , Vehari , Dera Ghazi Khan , Muzaffargarh , Rajanpur and Layyah have a combined area of 99,577 sq km . <p> The delimitation across the province largely remained the same with most comprising of whole districts . Only three districts -- Nasirabad , Kech and Quetta -- have been divided across constituencies . <p> In terms of the reorientation of districts , Ziarat , which was part of NA-258 Loralai-cum-Musa **37;520;TOOLONG has now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kohlu to form NA-253 . Shobatpur and Jaffarabad , which combined to form one seat in 2018 , have now been clubbed with Usta Muhammad and Nasirabad in NA-255 . In 2018 , Lasbela was with Gwadar in NA-272 . Now , it is a part of NA-257 with Awaran and Hub . District Kech previously qualified for an NA seat , but this time , it has been merged with Panjgur and Gwadar in two constituencies . <p> The three seats of Quetta have also undergone a significant modification . The city centre has been split into two constituencies , as compared to only one in 2018 . <p> Similarly , NA-264 of 2018 , which started from the Pakistan-Afghanistan border to the city 's northern outskirts , has been extended further east up to the Kacchi district . This constituency , NA-262 , circles from three sides , the other two constituencies -- NA-263 and NA-264 -- covering Quetta 's urban area . <h> ' Something for everyone in Karachi ' <p> In Sindh , the delimitation in 2023 was largely along the same lines as the previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kashmore districts had one seat each in the 2018 election . This time , the districts have been divided to accommodate them into two constituencies each . In another change , Sanghar district , which lost one seat that ended up being added to Karachi 's tally , taking the number of its constituencies to 22 . <p> In Karachi , one notable change in delimitation took place in District West which had five seats in 2018 . In 2023 , the number was reduced to three , due to the creation of District Keamari which got the remaining two seats . <p> Abdul Jabbar Nasir , a veteran journalist with expertise on Karachi 's electoral dynamics , ruled out any planned gerrymandering , but was quick to point out that in some constituencies , delimitation had n't been done in line with the principle of homogeneity , which gave the impression that some " attempts at facilitating a particular party " have been made . <p> He pointed out some areas in Malir where the final delimitation varied from the preliminary one , with PPP " benefitting from these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in District East gives the impression that " MQM-Pakistan has been facilitated " . <p> " Four union councils from where Jamaat-i-Islami used to win have been moved from NA-237 to NA-238 and the UCs in the latter have been added to the former where the JI has less influence as compared to MQM-P . " <p> Another major change in District East took place in the delimitation of 2018 's NA-243 from where former prime minister Imran Khan won in the last general election . The constituency extended from Gulzar-i-Hijri to Jinnah International Airport . In 2023 , the constituency was re-numbered to NA-236 and its boundary extended up to PAF Faisal Airbase . <p> In District South , said Mr Nasir , the delimitation of NA-239 and NA-240 is an " apparent attempt to accommodate both MQM-P and PPP " . <p> " It is difficult to say that constituencies in Karachi overwhelmingly favour one party , but it is true that the technical principles of delimitation were n't followed in many areas , " Mr Nasir concluded . 
@@105178235 <p> AURORA : We last had a formal interview in June 2020 in the middle of the Covid lockdown . In many ways , Covid was a defining moment for businesses the world over . Three years on , what were the lasting lessons of the pandemic ? AMIR PARACHA : The pandemic was a blessing in disguise . As far as Unilever is concerned , it made us put humanity before commercial imperatives and taught us to lead with care , compassion and empathy . We learned how to build business through conscious capitalism rather than cold-blooded capitalism . Unilever is as old as Pakistan . We have been here since 1948 and during this time we have talked about our presence , our operations and our brands . When Covid arrived we said to ourselves the country needs us , and we made a pledge that we would make our contribution in terms of vaccines , PPE and many other things . We changed our tagline from Unilever in Pakistan to Unilever for Pakistan -- and by just replacing ' in ' with ' for ' , made a huge difference internally . People felt connected ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job . It became a mission and a duty to serve people . We were perceived not as just a commercially driven company but one with a larger purpose . Despite the lockdown , our factory workers came to the production line because at that point soap was the only deterrent against Covid and our salesforce was constantly in the market stocking soap . In Pakistan , we are the largest company that makes soap , and it was not about selling , it was about rendering a service . We were the first brand to run an agnostic ad campaign urging people to buy any soap because saving lives was more important . When the pandemic ended and things started to ease , we saw how for the first time our people had felt emotionally connected to the company , and we felt that we had to keep this spirit alive . So we decided to stick with ' Unilever for Pakistan . ' Then the question was what would be the manifestation of ' Unilever for Pakistan ' after Covid ? There were three roads : protecting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opted for protecting livelihoods . <p> A : This was the subject of your Independence Day campaign ? AP : Yes . We started this initiative in 2021 . To be a company that is focused on providing a fair living wage . <p> A : Was this a local initiative or a global one ? AP : The idea was there at the global level , but it was not integral to the overall strategy or a rallying cry for everyone in the organisation . We wanted to make it a rallying cry . We set a target that by 2025 all our people -- approximately 90,000 -- would be earning a fair living wage . Predominantly , they are people who are not on our books ; those on our books -- 700 permanent employees -- are already on a fair living wage . It is more about the factory workers who are third-party workers and the salesforce who are employed by our distributors . Let me add that in doing this we are not led by a desire to be ethically compliant ; we are led by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we believe that a fair living wage is not a cost but an investment . <p> A : What is a fair living wage conceptually and in monetary terms ? AP : That people should earn enough to have a buffer against any emergency or unaccounted expense . It provides people with a dignified living so that without having to borrow they can survive . The Government of Pakistan has set the minimum wage at Rs 32,000 per month , and a fair living wage today would be around Rs 60,000 . Families in Pakistan need Rs 60,000 to have a decent life ; one that is free from worries about managing school fees or paying for medical expenses or the rent . <p> A : What would be the commercial case ? AP : In 2013 when I was in sales , my attrition rate was 40% -- meaning that over a two-year period , the entire workforce changed . We discovered that there is a direct correlation between the more experience a person has , the better the results they produce -- and this convinced us that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that they were paid so little , that if offered an extra Rs 500 they would quit . We decided to double their salary over the next three years and take care of their medical and education expenses . In three years , the attrition went down from 40 to four -- and sales went up . A direct correlation . So when people say that a fair living wage is an ethical consideration , my response is , on the contrary , it is a commercial one . Unilever is a for-profit organisation and we look at it as an investment . We have also taken the concept to other industries and we have formed an industry coalition . To date , it comprises 11 companies and they made a pledge to take their workforce to the fair living wage . But it is a journey and you ca n't do it overnight . In fact , the idea is starting to become a movement and there is now an understanding of the concept across industry . For Unilever Pakistan it is not about being the biggest or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most soulful company of Pakistan -- and we have done very well commercially in the last three to four years . People come to Unilever beyond purely commercial reasons . They come because it gives them purpose ; that they are performing a service for the country and its people . <p> A : How does it work in practice ? As it also involves third-party workers , does this mean an entity other than Unilever will have to absorb an increase in their HR overheads ? AP : There are two ways to do it . You grow fast enough and create enough leverage within the system to partially self fund it . Or you start a massive saving programme within the company . We have taken McKinsey on board to work on identifying savings . We are a big operation and there is a lot of wastage . We are extracting that wastage without creating any additional cost pressure on ourselves or our partners . The idea is to do it in a way that does not increase the cost of doing business , otherwise , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competitive . Of course , it is easier said than done . It has to be done very intelligently and the entire organisation has to be galvanised . This is a four year journey and we are doing this in a way that ensures the company remains competitive and profitable . It is about putting together a road map . The concept rests on two metrics . Ability to pay and willingness to pay . In this respect , there are four kinds of organisations . Organisations that are able to pay but are not willing . Organisations that are willing but not able . Organisations that are able and willing . Organisations that are neither able nor willing . We are trying to engage with organisations to at least come up to a level of willingness . If I broaden the canvas to the country level , the reality is that inequality of income in Pakistan is highly concentrated . According to our Human Development Index , inequality has gone up ; we were 120 out of 160 countries ; today we are 151 . But the situation can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go up , living standards go up , and when they go up , people buy more products more often . It 's like a boomerang . When the overall prosperity of the country goes up , the companies operating in the country benefit . <p> A : Why did you decide to publicise this initiative now ? AP : Because we have stress tested the idea for the last three years . Now when people ask me questions about it , I can give answers with conviction . <p> A : How was this initiative received by other companies ? AP : I received a lot of flak in the initial days . I went on a talk show and spoke about it and a post appeared on social media saying : " Amir Paracha , CEO , Unilever said that the country should move away from minimum wage to fair living wage , " and it went viral . So much so , that at some social gatherings , people came up to me to say that I was creating a big problem for them by making such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my company . Nevertheless , people are starting to accept the idea . This is why I do n't call this an initiative , but a movement . It may take another five or 10 years in Pakistan for it to gain not just acceptability but adoption . This is a long-term movement , not a flash in the pan . <p> A : Is the industry coalition of 11 companies as committed to the idea as you are ? AP : Many of them have shown willingness and taken some steps . Will they continue to stay invested ? I do n't think I am in a position to comment , but at least they have endorsed the concept . <p> A : At the global level , how invested is Unilever in this programme ? I ask because what happens if and when Amir Paracha moves on ; what are the chances of the next CEO bringing the same commitment you are displaying to the project ? AP : Number one , Unilever has clearly said that improving overall livelihoods across their entire end-to-end value chain is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever is done , it has to be commercially viable , because we are answerable to our shareholders . Number two , every Unilever company has its own P&amp;L to manage and as far as Unilever globally is concerned , if we can manage our P&amp;L , stay profitable and at the same time implement this initiative , we can go ahead . This means Unilever Pakistan had to work out its financial model and make the business case . To your question about what happens if and when I leave , my hunch is that given that we have institutionalised this programme all the way down to the lower rank of the organisation ; even were I to move away , it will sustain itself . One of the reasons why people work for Unilever is because this is a company that has a larger purpose than selling soap or ice cream . Millennials want to join an organisation that is driving a social cause ; they demand that the organisation they work for has a position on social issues . It is becoming integral to any commercial organisation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A : What are your thoughts about the current economic crisis ? AP : I am an optimist , and the last three months have been better than the preceding six . I do n't see any reason why Pakistan can not come out of this crisis , although we have never been in a crisis as bad as this one . Before we were able to get funding from somewhere , but this time it is another story . I think this could well be the best thing to have happened , because we have had to manage on our own -- and we have . However , to get out of this crisis for good , we need to take some structural decisions . We need to depoliticise the economy . <p> A : How difficult has it been to maintain market share in the face of heightened inflation ? AP : In a high inflation situation , consumers either down-trade or they downgrade . <p> A : What is the difference ? AP : Downgrade is when a Surf Excel consumer starts to use Rin , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- so we have three tiers . Similarly , we have TRESemm ? , Dove , Sunsilk and Lifebuoy . Consumers can easily downgrade because these brands are all doing the same job but at different price points . Down-trade is when a Surf Excel user down-trades from a one kilo pack that costs Rs 600 to a Rs 100 pack every week , rather than paying Rs 600 in one go . <p> A : Which one is more common ? AP : The downgrade . This is how we hold on to our category franchise , if not the brand franchise . We have enough brands within each category for consumers to move down . This has been our strategy and the reason why FMCG companies are usually called all-weather companies -- boom or bust , we manage to keep consumers afloat . <p> A : To what extent is Unilever affected by the trend to buy local ? AP : In the past , we used to have what was called the pipeline economy , whereby a brand owned the entire process from end-to-end . They manufactured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pipeline . Today we have a platform economy and everything is more democratised . If you want to launch your own shampoo , you can buy the formulation off the shelf . So a lot of local brands are coming up and consumers are moving to them because they are good brands -- especially because they think they are good value for money rather than a way of supporting the local economy . In fact , multinational brands support the economy more , because they conduct their business in the most responsible way possible . Be it the value system , the working conditions or paying taxes . Looked at from that lens , multinationals do business a lot more responsibly , and I think they have paved the way for local companies to come up to that level . <p> A : What leadership skills should the CEO in the age of the Millennials and Gen Z possess ? AP : When I started my career 27 ago , it was the era of command and control and a leader had to have charisma and awe . Today this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humility , relatability and ease and access . It has been a tectonic shift . Today , rather than dictate , you have to inspire people to follow a vision -- and then you trust them . Trust that they will work towards realising that vision . Start-ups are a great example . The humility young entrepreneurs bring to their task of building and scaling up a company . They are the leaders of the future and Millennials are inspired by such personalities and that is how to lead into tomorrow . <p> Amir Paracha was in conversation with Mariam Ali Baig .

Navigating the complexities of emotions and relationships can be challenging and I see you are looking to create a space where you can establish emotional intimacy with yourself and others . It seems like a fear of intimacy is a significant aspect of your current experiences . Let 's explore this further . <p> Firstly , consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you . Reflect on the feedback from friends describing you as such -- do their words align with your perception of yourself ? It 's apparent that expressing your emotions is a struggle , and there might be an element of avoidance in your responses . This avoidance could be a defence mechanism , a way of protecting yourself from potentially overwhelming emotions . <p> I 'm curious about your reluctance to express yourself and the association you draw between emotional expression and dependency . What is the belief system under this connection ? What makes you feel expressing yourself equates you to being dependent on someone ? What would it be like for you to start creating emotional space within ? What is that you are struggling to face within that you are avoiding ? What does showing emotions bring up for you ? What is the belief behind dependency ? What makes you feel being emotionally connected equates to dependency ? You ca n't accept new relationships , or you do n't want to ? When people come too close , what comes up for you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connected to others ? <p> Exploring these thoughts and questions might uncover deep-seated fears or anxieties . Furthermore , understanding your feelings towards new relationships and the discomfort that arises when people get too close can provide valuable insights . <p> Avoidance , as seen in your tendency to take a long time to understand your emotions , typically stems from a fear of confronting challenging feelings . It is a fear-based response , from what you 'd be forced to feel if you looked within . <p> Relationships are often a mirror to us . They bring out parts in us that we may be suppressing . They show us where our work lies . Your self-perception , where you believe you struggle to express emotions , take time to understand your feelings , fear dependence , and resist new relationships or physical closeness , hints at limiting beliefs that you might hold about yourself . <p> Difficulty in accepting new relationships may be a protective mechanism to maintain emotional distance , protecting yourself from potential emotional pain . This resistance could also be linked to a fear of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with forming deep emotional connections . It 's crucial to acknowledge these fears and reservations . <p> Exploring these aspects in therapy involves a journey into your past experiences , family dynamics and significant relationships . This process aims to identify the underlying beliefs and experiences that contribute to your current patterns . I sense that you try to intellectualise emotions . Emotions , by their nature , need to be felt and experienced . <p> Fear of dependency may be rooted in a desire for independence and self-reliance , possibly stemming from past experiences or personal beliefs . It could be helpful to explore factors that may have contributed to the development of that fear . Similarly , the apprehension towards new relationships may signify a disconnection with the self and a fear of the unknown . Past experiences , even if they are not traumatic , could be shaping your perception of relationships . <p> If you 're aspiring to create a life with emotional freedom , initiating the process of connecting with yourself and engaging in inner work is critical for you . it would be helpful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various approaches to challenge and reframe unhelpful beliefs . <p> Doing experiential exercises within a safe therapeutic space will aid you in the practice of vulnerability and emotional expression . Building a trusting therapeutic relationship is foundational , which will serve as a model for other healthy emotional connections and provide a supportive environment for exploring and transforming these patterns . <p> Remember , this journey of self-discovery and growth is a gradual process , and each step forward , no matter how small , is a significant achievement . <p> And a personal note from a therapist -- the inner journey is the most liberating and freeing journey you will ever go on .

Smith is expected to challenge that decision in the U.S. Supreme Court , whose conservative majority has generally voted in recent years against delaying scheduled executions . <p> On Wednesday , the Supreme Court denied Smith 's application in a separate proceeding to halt the execution on the grounds that a second execution attempt of any kind , after painfully botching the first try , amounts to unconstitutional " cruel and unusual punishment . " <p> Smith 's lawyers fear that the mask will not properly seal against Smith 's face , allowing oxygen to seep in , delaying or even averting the moment of unconsciousness but risking serious brain injury . They have proposed Alabama instead uses a hood pre-filled with pure nitrogen , to be plunged over his head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penalty experts also say the state has not provided enough information about how it will mitigate the danger to execution officials and others of using an invisible , odorless gas inside the death chamber . <p> Rev. Jeff Hood , spiritual adviser to Smith , who will be at Smith 's side , had to sign a form acknowledging the risk that the execution method poses to others . <p> As the waiver notes , nitrogen is an invisible , odorless , tasteless gas that makes up about 78% of normal breathing air , so if the concentration of nitrogen is increased , displacing oxygen , there is a risk of unconsciousness and even death . <p> U.S. states that use capital punishment have found it increasingly difficult to get drugs for lethal injections , partly because pharmaceutical companies forbid supplying them to prisons to comply with a European trade ban on goods to be used in torture or executions . <p> Besides Alabama , lawmakers in Oklahoma and Mississippi have approved similar nitrogen-asphyxiation execution protocols in recent years , but have yet to put them into practice . Maya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal non-profit group Reprieve , said the new method is " the latest effort to obscure the violence of the state taking a human life . " <p> " The state of Alabama has tortured Mr. Smith once , stabbing him with needles for hours , and by using him as a guinea pig for a dangerous , untested new method of execution , it is torturing him again , " Foa said in a statement . <p> Smith was convicted of murdering Elizabeth Sennett , a preacher 's wife , after he and an accomplice accepted a $1,000 fee from her husband to kill her , according to trial testimony . Eleven of 12 jurors voted to sentence Smith to life in prison , but an Alabama judge overruled their recommendation under a law that has since been abolished as unconstitutional . <p> Some of Sennett 's relatives have said they support the execution , scheduled for 6 p.m. at Alabama 's Holman Correctional Facility , and that they planned to attend . <p> " Why should we have to suffer ?

@@106281232 <h> Together for WASH <h> The link between climate change and WASH is undeniable . Droughts and floods , intensified by climate change <p> Stranded people wade through a flooded area after heavy monsoon rainfall in Rajanpur district of Punjab province on August 25 , 2022. -- AFP <p> Climate change is no longer a looming spectre from the 90s , casting a shadow over our future . It is here and it means business . We are scrambling to mitigate its effects and looking for solutions in everything -- from renewable energy , tree plantation and sustainable practices to energy and disaster preparedness -- and yet , amidst these vital efforts , one crucial aspect remains woefully ignored : water , sanitation , and hygiene or WASH ( SDG 6 ) . <p> So why do we sideline WASH ? The reasons are varied , ranging from funding constraints to a lack of awareness and integration within the existing climate plans . The most immediate and common reason is the belief that WASH is just ' building toilets ' . <p> Building toilets , while an important component of WASH , is just one piece of the bigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and improvements and aims to elevate health , dignity , and wellbeing by ensuring access to three fundamental resources : clean water , improved sanitation , and good hygiene practices , and reducing its scope to ' building toilets ' is a grave injustice . <p> Building toilets , although significant , represents just one step within the comprehensive approach of WASH . There needs to be an associated behavioural change which can only occur through education and awareness raising . Merely building physical infrastructure is not enough ; there is a need to campaign encouraging good hygiene practices -- washing hands with soap after using toilets and before preparing and/or consuming food -- food safety and handling guidelines , and water safety and storage guidelines , etc to ensure adequate WASH standards are adopted along with the new infrastructure . <p> This means that WASH is n't just an optional add-on to make some projects look pretty or an optional check-list item . It is an essential pillar of community health and a shield against climate change-related shocks . <p> The link between climate change and WASH is undeniable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disrupt access to clean water and sanitation , forming breeding grounds for disease and despair . Flood waters contaminate clean water sources , making them undrinkable and unusable ; not only that , but lack of proper sewage treatment in rural areas has also contaminated the groundwater to such a point that it has also become undrinkable along with once clear ponds and streams , which have become dark and scummy bogs . <p> On the flip side , droughts also exacerbate sanitation challenges , creating breeding grounds for mosquitoes and other disease vectors . In either case , the consequences are dire , in many cases leading to increased child mortality , weakened immune systems , and stunted growth . <p> Moreover , these challenges disproportionately impact the most vulnerable . Women and girls face heightened risks due to limited access to safe sanitation facilities during menstruation and increased water collection burdens . Children 's health suffers the most , bearing the brunt of waterborne diseases . This adds another layer of injustice to the already unequal impact of climate change . <p> WASH prioritizes gender equity and recognizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocates for menstrual hygiene management facilities , promotes safe sanitation practices during menstruation , and addresses the challenges girls face in accessing sanitation facilities , especially during disasters . This inclusive approach fosters a sense of safety and dignity for all while contributing to positive community development . <p> Well , that 's all well and good , but there are people dying of hunger and disease in Pakistan . Should n't we spend the money on them instead ? I hear you and I say , the cost of inaction is far greater . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) estimates that inadequate WASH costs developing countries $260 billion annually in lost productivity and healthcare expenses . <p> By prioritizing WASH , we can not only save lives and promote health but also free up resources for other adaptation measures . But Mainstreaming WASH in Climate Action ( SDG 13 ) requires a multi-pronged approach . First , climate-resilient WASH infrastructure must be built . This includes rainwater harvesting systems , flood-proof sanitation facilities , and drought-resistant water sources ; some of these things are slowly being introduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place by individuals on their own initiative . <p> Second , community-based WASH education is crucial . Equipping communities with knowledge of hygiene practices , water conservation , and disease prevention empowers them to adapt and thrive ; this too is beginning to take hold across Pakistan through the work of various CSOs and some government institutions such as PDMAs and other local bodies . <p> Finally , gender-inclusive WASH programmes must be implemented , ensuring every individual has access to safe and dignified sanitation facilities . This is where we still need to put a bit more work but we 'll get there . <p> This is not a pipe dream . Organizations like Unicef , WaterAid , and IRC-WASH are demonstrating the effectiveness of integrated WASH-climate action programmes . The results are tangible : reduced disease outbreaks , improved child health , and empowered communities more resilient to climate shocks . The time for marginalizing WASH is over . Every drop of clean water , every safe toilet , every handwashing session becomes a bulwark against the climate crisis . Let us not build walls of indifference but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sanitation . <p> By mainstreaming WASH into climate action , we can protect our health , empower communities , and build a future where everyone , regardless of circumstance , has the right to health , dignity , and a life free from fear of climate threats .

@@106281233 <h> The reserved seats race <h> However , the reserved seats issue is somewhat different <p> Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja on Tuesday consolidated all the petitions filed by the Sunni Ittehad Council ( SIC ) regarding the allocation of reserved seats . The electoral watchdog had decided to hold an open hearing on the SIC application seeking allotment of reserved seats after PTI-backed lawmakers joined their ranks . There were two apparent reasons for the PTI-affiliated independent candidates joining the SIC : one , to make sure that these candidates should come under party discipline as per Article 63A and not jump ship ; and two , not to lose their share of the reserved seats in parliament . The PTI says that no assembly session can be called without notifying reserved seats and if the National Assembly session is called , it will also be illegal . However , legal experts do n't agree with Gohar 's point of view and say that the first NA session has to be held within 21 days after elections , something the Election Commission of Pakistan ( ECP ) on Tuesday also confirmed by saying that the National and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presidential election , as per Article 41 ( 4 ) , should be held within 30 days after the general elections . Legal experts also say that the PTI 's insistence that the NA speaker or prime minister or president can not be elected till parliament is complete is also wrong as parliament is mostly incomplete after elections when some lawmakers contest from multiple seats and if they win all or some of them , they have to give up their extra seats and keep just one . <p> However , the reserved seats issue is somewhat different . By many legal interpretations , there is little rationale to deprice bonafide elected members their chance at reserved seats if they decide to come under a parliamentary party -- which is their right . Per this view , while there is no provision in the Election Act that allows for a completely new list to be submitted by any party , the ECP should still make room for PTI-SIC since this was a unique situation when a party was deprived of its election symbol just before the elections and did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end up joining after the elections and whether that party had given any reserved seats list or not . As for the other view , some experts quote Article 51(6) ( d ) , which says " ... members to the seats reserved for women which are allocated to a province under clause ( 3 ) shall be elected in accordance with law through proportional representation system of political parties ' lists of candidates on the basis of total number of general seats secured by each political party from the province concerned in the National Assembly . " They say that due to this , PTI-SIC should get their seats . But the question of no new list is still a valid concern for most legal experts . As for those who say that parties can give new names , legal experts say that it is only if the list they have given has been exhausted but it does not mean that an entirely new list is being given . <p> Adding to the confusion are the PPP and PML-N suddenly claiming a stake in the leftover reserved seats . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties wanting a share in these seats . Given the fraught political situation , one wonders how many windows of conflict are enough . Perhaps , the ECP needs to resolve this matter as per democratic norms keeping the PTI 's unique situation in mind .

@@106438238 <h> Will Shehbaz Sharif succeed as PM ? <h> PML-N itself , PPP , and PTI all needed more Shehbaz Sharif , not less <p> Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif inspecting the guard of honour presented by a contingent of Pakistan 's armed forces upon arrival at the Prime Minister 's House on March 4 , 2024 -- PID <p> There is a profound disquiet about the state of the country across all social , economic and political classes . People are worried about how badly the next wave of Ishaq Dar branded madness will affect them when they go to buy basic groceries , or when they try to get a discount at the private school where their kids are studying , or when they try to get an installment plan to pay for an unforeseen medical emergency that their parents have suffered . After all , even though Pakistan is younger and younger , old people are still getting older . <p> It is hard to remember when there was less excitement about a new Pakistani government -- which is profoundly sad for two reasons , one macro and the other micro . <p> The macro is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polling day . They did so with great hope about the future and great conviction about the institutions of Pakistan ( they had to have , given the throttling of many civil rights that preceded the election ) . What took place on the evening of February 8 and throughout February 9 and February 10 may have cost the PTI 13 seats , or 22 seats , or even the magical 35 seats in the National Assembly -- we can not be certain . What we can be certain about is that what took place cost Pakistan 's institutions the confidence of those young first-time voters . This is not just sad , but also potentially dangerous and can not be ignored . <p> The micro is that Shehbaz Sharif remains -- among senior politicians in the country -- one of the few who is genuinely excited about building new things and watching Pakistanis benefit from them . For him to take his second oath of office in even worse overarching circumstances than when he took oath in April 2022 is sad because it feels like the deck is stacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whilst he is PM during this term will be burdened by sins that were not of his doing . Like cowbell , this country , the PML-N itself , the PPP , and the PTI all needed more Shehbaz Sharif , not less . This version of Shehbaz Sharif is less -- from even before he takes oath . <p> Despite the lack of excitement for this government , it is important to highlight the big win for Pakistan amidst all this . Consider just how incredible it is for Pakistan to have elected its fourth consecutive parliament -- without the disruption of the suspension of our constitution , without martial law , without military rule , and without a general becoming the formal leader of the country . From the election in February 2008 till the election in February 2024 marks a full sixteen years of concurrent , consecutive , sustained democracy in Pakistan . <p> Is it flawed ? Of course , it is . We live in the age of populism and digital hyperbole -- everything is flawed . Is it weak ? Of course , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time under Brand SIFC ) , it is certainly not a certificate of good health for civilian governance . Is it open and free ? Hardly . Between populism on one side and sustained neo-feudal dynasties on the other , there is hardly any space for new politics to emerge . The press and media are intensely different and significantly less free from what they were back in 2008 . <p> Still : four consecutive parliaments is nothing to scoff at . Those for whom nothing in Pakistan is ever good enough never tire of reminding Pakistanis that no prime minister has ever completed a full five-year term . If that is a legitimate critique of the quality of democracy in Pakistan , then four consecutive parliaments represent a legitimate credit to democracy 's incredible endurance in the conflict zone that is Pakistan 's alignment with its constitution . <p> The military 's shadow hovers over all governance . This is also clearly true . Public policy is imbued with Pindi 's fingerprints to an unprecedented degree . At a time when the country faces kinetic threats at four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indo-Pacific via the Arabian Sea , and of course , Mother India -- Pakistan is investing in an unquestionably high-risk strategic tilt by choosing to have an institution this deeply involved in affairs not related to it . This is one among a slew of very profound challenges that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will face . <p> So , will Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif succeed or fail ? Even the most hardened anti-Sharifs will likely be more invested in Pakistan 's well-being than they will be in their partisanship . Indeed , one might say that the whole country ( including the most robust critics of the Sharifs ) would want PM Sharif to succeed . There is just one problem . We ca n't really tell if the incoming government will succeed or fail because we do n't know what this government 's objectives are . <p> When the PPP coalition government took over in 2008 , we knew exactly what its key objective was . The project then was to shore up democratic governance and renew Pakistan 's federal character . A team effort -- led by Asif @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the seat of power in Lahore , and General Kayani at GHQ -- delivered . Pakistan got the 18th Amendment and the seventh NFC Award . Lots and lots went wrong too , but the key objective of that government was delivered . <p> In 2013 , when the PML-N took power under then-prime minister Nawaz Sharif , we also knew exactly what that government 's primary objective was . It was a government for electricity . Many young Pakistanis will not recall just how bad loadshedding had gotten in the run-up to the 2013 election , but building out the electricity generation capacity was the overarching strategic objective . This objective was achieved . Was it achieved in the best manner possible ? Given the burden the IPPs impose on the exchequer and the carbon footprint solutions generated , clearly not . Like the PPP coalition in 2008 , lots and lots went wrong for the 2013 PML-N government too -- but the key objective of that government was delivered . <p> When Imran Khan became PM under the PTI coalition in 2018 , we also knew the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objective in different ways -- for the PTI itself , the preferred framing was that it had been elected to end corruption . My interpretation ( knowing how many allegedly corrupt patrons that government had itself ) was that what the PTI really meant was that it had been elected to change how Pakistan worked . It was the first truly reformist mandate Pakistanis had voted for since 1988 . Of course , this objective was not met . Despite that , lots and lots went right for the PTI government -- its handling of Covid-19 , expansion of the social protection offered by the state , improved civil-military relations , and a powerful health insurance scheme -- but the key objective of that government was not delivered . <p> The problem that bled PM Shehbaz Sharif in 2022 and will bleed him even more profusely in 2024 is not the degree of legitimacy the electorate affords to his government . That burden will be carried more by the backers of the SIFC than it will by the PML-N . The problem that hounded the first term of PM Sharif @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the absence of a coherent objective . <p> Ask and they will say the country 's polycrisis demands steadiness and stability . What does this mean ? They will tell us it means securing an IMF programme and repairing relations with China , the United States , Saudi Arabia , and the UAE . But probe a little deeper and there will be little of substance . <p> What we know is that the core objective of the incoming government is not economic growth , it is not regional consolidation of Pakistan 's role as a net provider of security in the region , it is not improved female labour force participation , it is not dramatic actualization of Pakistan 's trade potential , it is not terminating the TTP and its affiliates , it not solving the crisis of malnutrition , it is not expanding adult literacy , it is not burying polio for good , it is not winning the next cricket world cup , it is not establishing a framework to take advantage of various opportunities for Pakistan -- from Saudi Arabia 's Vision 2030 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is certainly not solving Pakistan 's energy dependence problem , or its foreign direct investment problem , or its broken civil services problem , or its phantom local governance problem . <p> If there is a core objective and purpose for the incoming government , it seems to be for it to be the government . Of course , for as long as it is allowed to be this government , it will succeed . But is this really the flight of a shehbaz ?

The gigantic task ahead for the new coalition government is to restore the confidence of the people of Pakistan in the electoral system . <p> A policy framework is immediately needed to address the myriad issues plaguing this country -- from economy and politics to social fragmentation and polarization . <p> The new government branded as PDM2.0 has to take up the issues of the economy on an emergency basis . But it has to take steps to restore the confidence of people in the system . For this , political leaders need to sit down to promote social cohesion as this society has suffered a lot due to political polarization . <p> The question is which task needs to be taken first and which one can be left for later ?

The country now needs to adopt policies that can heal the wounds of our polarized society through reconciliation . <p> A hard bargain is underway for the new coalition government .

The most difficult task is to maintain the balance and work for the larger interest of the nation as they are passing through a difficult phase of economic and political crises . <p> The wisdom of political leadership is needed to tackle the political crisis . Ideally , all political leaders including Imran Khan should be consulted and taken on board to solve the political puzzle . Otherwise , this crisis may cause another government to pack up and leave within a short span . <p> The economy is the most important chapter to be addressed by the new government .

This situation must be considered by international financial institutions when drafting loan terms for developing countries like Pakistan . <p> A long-term economic plan needs to be chalked out to enhance exports through massive investment in industrial clusters by extending tax incentives to investors and exporters . Special economic zones ( SEZs ) may be taken up as a priority for such clusters that are providing jobs to the people of Pakistan . The security situation has to be improved at all costs to attract investment in the country . <p> A long-term plan is also needed to tackle the issue of huge loans as Pakistan is in the severe grip of a vicious cycle of a huge debt crisis .

A growth target of at least six per cent or more is needed for 10-15 years to get rid of loans if Pakistan wants to become an Asian Tiger . <p> Policymakers and think tanks must do something about political polarization in the country to promote unity among all sections of society . Luckily , political parties have emerged as the main crowd pullers , essentially needed to forge unity and consensus among the nation .

The young are losing hope in the process of political manipulation . Social cohesion for any progressive society is direly needed . Pakistan is in a state of social disintegration . Hopelessness is the worst thing in a country like Pakistan which has a huge percentage of young people .

Egypt 's concession of Ras al Hikma underscores a stark reality : financial aid , especially from fraternal nations , often carries hidden costs , potentially demanding painful sacrifices of national assets .

As Pakistan forges its path toward economic recovery , the insights gleaned from Egypt 's engagements with the IMF and its broader economic strategy highlight the critical need for a nuanced , multifaceted approach that balances immediate economic exigencies with long-term structural reforms .

The PTI seems to be on a collision path not only with the Shehbaz-led government but also with the powers that be . <p> Khan 's stubbornness has perhaps prompted state institutions to harden their position . The recent corps commanders ' conference , vowing to punish the May 9 attacks ' perpetrators , also reflects this unrelenting stance . The statement also creates an impression that no political uncertainty or agitation will be tolerated . <p> The nomination of Ali Amin Gandapur as the chief minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the award of key positions in the party and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stakeholder . The PTI might have thought that by making these appointments , it could pressure the powers that be into negotiating with Khan , but this approach seems to have boomeranged . <p> The arrests of PTI leaders and workers on Sunday ( March 10 ) clearly show that the state will not tolerate any agitation that might affect political stability and push the country towards anarchy . The state institutions seem to have a firm belief that an investment-friendly environment can not be created without political stability . <p> It is true that Khan demonstrated excellent street power in the past by paralyzing Islamabad and other urban areas , but what he tends to ignore is the patronage of invisible powers that he enjoyed in the good old days . It was this patronage which helped him mount relentless attacks on Nawaz Sharif 's government in 2014 . <p> It was again this blessing that encouraged Khan to undertake different marches . But all such favours ended with the catastrophic incident of May 9 when Khan , according to his detractors , tried to bite the hands that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should realize that they no longer enjoy the support of the state 's mighty elements and that in Pakistan no agitation has ever succeeded without their support . If the Pakistan National Alliance managed to paralyze Zulfikar Ali Bhutto 's government in 1977 , it was all because of this blessing . The anti-Ayub Khan movement was spontaneous but at a certain stage , it also attracted such blessings . The same could be said about the protests staged against General Musharraf , who had become a liability . <p> Political agitation between 1988 and 1999 had also blessings of the powers that be -- whether it was the long march of Benazir Bhutto against Nawaz Sharif or the Tehreek-e-Nijaat of Nawaz Sharif . <p> So , it is in the interest of Imran Khan and his party to avoid confrontation . The party is ruling over Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and after the 18th Amendment , it enjoys enough resources to deliver and translate the rhetoric of Khan into reality . The provincial chief executive should go beyond hurling allegations against the political class and focus on addressing a myriad of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all claims , the party could not offer an impressive model of governance there . Imran Khan ridiculed other leaders for choosing to seek treatment abroad , but is there any government hospital in KP where PTI leaders would like to be treated ? Is there any excellent state-run school in KP where Ali Amin Gandapur and his ministers would like to send their children ? Has the PTI wiped out poverty from that region ? Is corruption a talk of the past ? Can accountability be described as impressive ? Does the province have any trace of nepotism and cronyism ? <p> It seems Khan is trying to repeat the mistakes he committed after being ousted in April 2022 . At that time , he had governments in Punjab , Azad Jammu and Kashmir , Gilgit-Baltistan and KP . He could have decided to continue ruling over those provinces , bringing drastic changes to people 's lives . But the ' agitator-in-chief ' decided to follow a collision path , dissolving the governments of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa against the advice of saner elements within the PTI . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used the GB police to confront Punjab and federal forces , which did not go down well with the policymakers of the country who considered it a form of mutiny . <p> Since 2011 , Khan has been following a policy of confrontation . First , his confrontation was directed against the political class , declaring all politicians corrupt and incompetent . This approach did a great disservice to the political system of the country . Later , he turned his guns towards his old allies who had propped him up for years . This stunned his benefactors who felt betrayed and described this attitude as nothing but ungratefulness . They tried to reconcile with him , but he was not ready to give up his recalcitrance . His tirade against the benefactors finally pushed him towards a political suicide . <p> It seems Imran Khan is still interested in following this suicidal approach . He is still denigrating the political class . In the past , such denigration had the backing of his benefactors , but now that is over . His love for a sectarian party and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even within his party . <p> It seems the history of Khan 's politics is nothing except political immaturity . Unfortunately , he does not seem to be realizing this . He is unable to reflect upon his political somersaults . He mimicked Mahmood Khan Achakzai publicly , ridiculed Maulana Fazlur Rahman , and described Parvaiz Elahi as the biggest thief of Punjab but switched his positions when the same personalities and political parties could help him succeed in his political ambitions . He once called members of the MQM-P decent people and thanked Nawaz Sharif for extending help for his cancer hospital , but turned against them for his political career . Such a hypocritical approach has badly dented his reputation among many critics . <p> The sages of the political world believe that politics tend to be unpredictable . Today 's enemies could turn out to be friends tomorrow and vice versa , which is why it is prudent to be politically prescient and avoid issuing statements that become a source of embarrassment . <p> The country is going through many crises . Issues like low economic growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rising terrorism need the urgent attention of all politicians including Khan . <p> Threatening to influence the IMF through political agitation or letter-writing would not be appreciated by the biggest stakeholders . Perennial agitation will only spoil the political environment . The collision path will be destructive for not only Khan but the country as well . <p> Therefore , common sense should prevail . Khan should give up this political agitation . Nawaz and Zardari should engage with him while all institutions should confine themselves to matters they are constitutionally bound to look after . This might create the much-needed environment for political reconciliation that could go some way in ending this perennial agitation that has been plaguing the country for decades . <p> The writer is a freelance journalist who can be reached at : **27;1326;TOOLONG

That a woman was almost lynched for wearing clothes that an illiterate crowd mistook for religious text highlights Pakistan 's extremism problem . <p> Dismissing events like this incident as outliers or choosing to ignore them will not prevent them from occurring again . In December 2021 , the Sri Lankan manager of a factory in Sialkot was beaten to death and set ablaze by a mob over allegations of blasphemy that turned out to be spurious . The woman in Lahore with the dress bearing Arabic language words was lucky that she escaped a similar fate . <p> The dress worn by the woman in question bore the word ' Halwa ' in Arabic script . The word means beautiful in Arabic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arabic calligraphy to be used to adorn dresses , buildings , and much more . But the irrational environment in Pakistan over religious matters , especially allegations of blasphemy , put the woman 's life at risk . The international publicity over the incident ensured that everyone around the world who might be thinking of doing business with Pakistan had to think about facing similar risks . <p> Nations pay a hefty price when the rest of the world sees them as irrational or extreme . Racist violence , for example , acts as a disincentive for business travelers belonging to different races from traveling to countries where race is an issue . In the case of Pakistan , religious extremism and vigilantism have become a factor in the decisions of potential investors and merchants . <p> Two days after the Lahore incident , an Arab businessman remarked to me that he immediately thought of his wife and daughters . " They wear Arabic calligraphy designs as part of their dress , " he said , adding , " I was thinking of expanding my business to Pakistan , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my wife or daughters , risking such attacks ? " <p> Pakistan already has the world 's toughest blasphemy laws and blasphemy is punishable by death after a trial . But some groups do not wait for the law to take its course and want to act as judge , jury , and executioner . Several people have been lynched before their cases go to trial and those acquitted due to lack of evidence are also attacked as if the allegation of blasphemy requires no proof other than the allegation itself . <p> Judges , too , have to fear the backlash of those who pretend to be all-knowing while hearing such cases . Instead of making Pakistani society more religious or pious , the practice of whipping up a crowd in a religious frenzy has created situations in which mobs lose all fear of God . Even in the recent case of the woman wearing the Arabic calligraphy dress , the crowd had to be pacified with an apology from the woman though she had done nothing wrong . As Maulana Tahir Ashrafi pointed out , the men in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the ones to apologize . <p> Government after government in Pakistan has appeased groups that use religious slogans to divide and scare Pakistanis . Some have even seen the extremists as guarantors of Pakistan 's security or as instruments of Pakistani influence across the border in Afghanistan or Kashmir . But the net impact of nurturing a religious outrage industry has only been to undermine Pakistan 's external relations and weaken its economy . Official data suggests that between 2001 and 2018 " the direct and indirect cost incurred by Pakistan due to incidents of terrorism " amounted to $123.13 billion . <p> Add to it the cost of fostering a society driven by anger and unable to figure out its real place in the modern world . Since falling under Western colonial rule , the Muslim world has developed a narrative of grievance and Pakistan is no exception .

" <p> According to Suhrawardy , " a state which will be held together by raising the bogey of attacks and which you keep together by keeping up a constant friction between yourself and your sister Dominion India , that state will be full of alarms and excursions .

" There will be lawlessness and those lawless elements that may be turned today against non-Muslims will be turned later on , once those fratricidal tendencies have been aroused , against the Muslim gentry and I want you to be warned in time , " he observed . <p> Today , those words seem prescient .

The judicial branch is responsible for the expeditious delivery of justice as per the country 's constitution and the government 's business rules .

This ultimately resulted in the creation of a global map that shows Pakistan 's current lower standing in a number of categories , including governance , ease of doing business , policy-making , the corporate sector , justice , and human and social development . <p> With this background in mind , an effective justice , good governance , and efficient public policymaking process always start with thoughtful judgments taken at the highest levels of government , which are then followed by a careful and constrained execution plan .

It is a well-established reality that ineffective public policies and bad administration have fostered non-transparency in government activities and the unchecked discretion of government officials , all of which have ultimately led to corruption , favoritism , and a massive waste of public funds in Pakistan . <p> Since the Board of Investment Ordinance established the Special Investment Facilitation Council ( SIFC ) , a new forum with a dynamic and significant membership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pakistan 's entire policymaking process and identify the areas of policy preparation , efficiency , and effectiveness at all levels of government -- federal , provincial , and local -- with a strong implementation time-bounded plan . <p> It is now imperative that the prime minister , chief ministers , SIFC , federal and provincial planning development departments , and relevant agencies take the lead for good governance and in formulating and implementing public policies and in examining and developing a practical and forward-looking framework for the planning process . Training for lawmakers , judiciary , and the executive branch is also essential for the successful good governance , justice , and formulation and implementation of successful public policies in Pakistan . To establish lively , citizen-oriented , and successful public policies in Pakistan , governments at all levels must , in addition to their strengths , use the potential of relevant experts and implement best international practices throughout all stages of administration and public policy . <p> Thus the success of public programmes , initiatives , and the welfare of the country require action to be conducted simultaneously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprehensive research prior to policy formulation , accounting for potential impacts , enhancing public engagement , securing suitable expert consultation for the appropriate allocation and utilization of public funds , and enhancing institutional capability and framework across all governmental tiers . <p> These activities start with the ideation phase and proceed through the planning , developing , reviewing , and carrying out of public policy within the allotted time frame .

@@106672235 <h> How to deal with the world <h> We live in a polarized world where there are two major conflicts raging on at the moment <p> Now that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has his cabinet in place , it may be time to have a quick look at what each ministry has been handed -- poisoned chalice or a potential boon ? One of the more pressing issues will be -- always is -- how Pakistan deals with the outside world . The man tasked to make our case to the world is Muhammad Ishaq Dar who on Tuesday formally became the 39th foreign minister of Pakistan . In his new role , Dar will have to take stock of all the challenges that Pakistan faces when it comes to foreign and diplomatic relations . But will he be able to break away from his past as Pakistan 's finance head ? In his maiden speech as foreign minister , Dar reportedly focused more on the economic challenges that Pakistan faces rather than on matters related to foreign policy and media reports have suggested that our new foreign minister may want the Foreign Office to play a role in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go about all this would be to just let the new finance minister focus on resolving the economic crisis and for everyone else to focus on their own ministry . Perhaps the PM should be reminded of cooks and bad broths . <p> It is not like the foreign ministry wo n't have work on its hands . Even though Pakistan 's foreign policy is mostly defined by a more security imperative , the foreign minister will have the task of being the face of Pakistan 's balancing act between the US and China . After PTI founder Imran Khan 's cipher conspiracy , the PDM government with Bilawal Bhutto Zardari as foreign minister tried to mend relations between the US and Pakistan . Bilawal Bhutto was successful to quite an extent . Even then , the minister of state at the time , Hina Rabbani Khar , had suggested that Pakistan should stop maintaining a " middle ground " between the US and China as per leaked documents that were published in The Washington Post . Khar had argued that in order to preserve its partnership with the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategic " partnership with China . This view is not new . There are many experts who believe the same . Dar will have to be extra tactful with the US since the PML-N government is in power and there are talks of revival of the CPEC projects that were put on the backburner during the PTI 's tenure . Dar would understand this better than most that solely one side can not be picked over the other and a careful balance has to be maintained , as he has dealt with both countries as finance minister in the past . <p> Then there is the Middle East , and our ties with those countries have been quite strong . We live in a polarized world where there are two major conflicts raging on at the moment . Pakistan has always taken a pro-Palestine position historically and traditionally , which it continues to do even now . On the Ukraine-Russia conflict , Pakistan has remained neutral but former army chief General Bajwa did spell out our policy back in 2022 when this war escalated that " despite legitimate security concerns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be condoned " . In recent months , we have seen incursions by Iran into Pakistani territory . Thankfully , Pakistan made sure there was no knee-jerk reaction . This will be another challenge for Dar as foreign minister -- to artfully make sure that such serious issues are dealt with in a diplomatic manner . Another issue that some experts have raised is trade with India . Pakistan has spoken about normalizing relations with India if the Occupied Kashmir issue is resolved , especially after the Modi government 's decision to revoke the special status for the state of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir ( IIOJK ) . India under Modi has become so belligerent that at this moment resuming ties will be a tricky proposition . Overall , the foreign ministry has too much on its plate for it to encroach on someone else 's territory along the way .

@@106855231 <p> Every year , during Ramazan , the same old debate makes its way to our timelines : is it permissible to brush your teeth while fasting ? No , sorry , wrong script . What we 're actually here to discuss is whether you should dice your fruit into perfectly small chunks , mix them well and season them with sugar , chaat masala and lemon to consume for iftaar . A wise Olivia Rodrigo once said , " It 's a bad idea , right ? " But if you really think about it , maybe not . <p> A recent podcast between Akbar Chaudhry , Ali Gul Pir and Amtul Baweja got us thinking about the many variations of fruit salad , or ' fruit chaat ' as desis like to call it , and whether there 's a version that everybody can get on board with . It may be a Ramazan staple , but people have all kinds of negative feelings for this harmless blend of nature 's delights . We 're as surprised as you are ... <p> Many would thank Pir for declaring , " Fruits should be eaten as is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Others would second Chaudhry , " Fruit chaat , I hate with a passion . " The comedian even called it a " sugary saalan " -- something we ca n't get out of our heads . <p> Meanwhile , Baweja enlightened us about some fruit chaat variations being worse than others . " Some people add Tang to their fruit chaat . I 've even seen people adding Rooh Afza ... " But while the comedian , rapper and influencer all came to the conclusion that " fruit chaat should be banned , " we had our reservations . <p> Fruit chaat has been passed down from generation to generation . So much so , that it 's our birthright . There 's no replacement for a mash of your favourite fruits chopped up in one bowl .

@@106855232 <p> PAKISTAN 'S pre-eminent community health outreach programme -- the Lady Health Worker ( LHW ) Programme -- has been around for 30 years . As we celebrate this pearl jubilee anniversary , it behoves policymakers to sort through research and evidence collected over time to assess success and failure so as to fix what is broken . <p> Here are some recent statistics on the state of healthcare in this country . According to Unicef data , every year more than 350,000 of the 6.3 million babies born , die in infancy . Six out of every 100 children die in the country before they complete their fifth year . Health ministry demographic surveys show that around 15,000 women die annually while giving birth . Pakistan faces a nutrition emergency with stunting a key cause of concern that affects over 40 per cent of children . The Bureau of Statistics figures place population growth rate at a high 2.4pc with a stagnating contraceptive prevalence rate of 34pc . Infectious diseases , maternal health and undernutrition comprise around half of the national burden of disease . <p> The LHW programme was designed to tackle a specific set of issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The system of healthcare provision in the 1980s halted at the Basic Health Unit which was failing a majority of rural communities , due to difficulty of access . The programme sought to focus on reproductive , maternal , neonatal and child health and included the provision of basic services as well as referring community members to the nearest public health facilities ( especially for deliveries and complications ) . In particular , the programme offered family planning services and facilitated the uptake of contraceptive use , nutrition best practices , and preventive healthcare through both awareness-raising and the provision of certain medicines and products . <p> The initiative started with 10,000 LHWs , and over time , expanded progressively to the current figure of 85,000 LHWs . While this expansion is a reflection of the programme 's initial successes , it also reflects a measure of inertia in thought leadership and strategy -- there were no smartphones in the early 1990s , and today mobile phone ownership is at 90pc in Pakistan ( of which around 60pc are smartphone users ) . But there was much that worked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the health status of communities in LHWs catchment areas as compared to communities where no LHWs were present . These included substantive increases in vaccination rates for children , in family planning/ contraceptive prevalence rates , improvements in preventive healthcare ( nutrition , breastfeeding ) , lower childhood diarrhoea rates , and higher numbers of deliveries at local facilities . <p> Policymakers must review the challenges faced by the Lady Health Workers Programme . <p> However , by 2012 , the differentials in figures started to peter out , and the impact of LHWs was seen to be stagnating . The 18th Constitutional Amendment came into force and the provinces took over the management of the LHW cadre , as health became a provincial subject . LHWs themselves , having spent nearly 20 years as an extension of , but never within , the official government employee pool , demanded changes to their status . Their asks : to become permanent government employees with all the usual perks and emoluments , enjoy promotions and a pension on retirement . <p> These were fair ; however , once regularised , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiple reasons for this as their initial success made them a panacea for all kinds of other health interventions . The burdens on this cadre increased as they became a part of every government public health campaign -- be it polio , tuberculosis , even facilitators for elections . This enhanced burden meant a further erosion of effectiveness . <p> Today , the LHW programme stands at a crossroads . Policymakers need to undertake an extensive review of the challenges and find new and innovative solutions for a Pakistan that is very different from what it was 30 years ago . We need to have diversified rural and urban healthcare models . Provinces need to support one another to identify what works and where . For example , the LHWs are not a model that works well in Balochistan given the way society and geography intersect . They do better in the other provinces , but may not be so relevant in urban centres . <p> The creators of the original programme believe that the model has already been corrupted -- first because the idea of LHWs were that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a specific set of services to households that they had familiarity with . It was easier for them than for any outsider to enter homes and be trusted enough to talk to the women and children . With the regularisation and retention of LHWs , postings and transfers became the norm , which came at a cost to the community . An older lady may not have the same motivation or energy as one 30 years her junior , nor would her word hold weight with a much younger population that has access to a world of information at their fingertips , however inaccurate it may be . <p> Finally , there is not enough debate on what types of exit strategies are available for this cadre of workers . Globally , community health worker models were created to strengthen weak health systems in developing economies . In Pakistan , while the conceptualisation and actualisation of the programme was relevant and effective , there was less clarity on whether this was a short- or long-term solution , and to what extent it would move the country towards quality universal health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through what would happen to the cadre of women enrolled in the programme . Their longer-term expectations and needs -- financial and career related -- were not part of the planning process .

I learned this lesson in 1971 when I spent time in Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon and Jordan collecting people 's stories of the Nakba . Their memories of the homes and lands they left behind , their deep longing to return , and their determination to keep alive their village culture was deeply moving . The powerful connection of Palestinians to their land became even more clear when I got to know and learn from the works of some of the great Palestinian poets like Tawfiq Zayad and Mahmoud Darwish or the Palestinian artists like Ismail Shamout and Kamal Boulatta . The images they created and the feelings they evoked have inspired generations . <p> You can learn more about a people through the songs they sing , the stories they tell , or the art they love than you can from the political speeches of their leaders . In all of these forms of Palestinian popular culture , attachment to land looms large . Palestinian refugees will recall their ancestral homes .

In short , their past lives , their present sorrows . and their hopes for the future are bound up in their attachment to their land . <p> Given this , it should be no surprise that Land Day ( or Day in Defense of the Land ) has become so important to Palestinians worldwide . <p> The history of this day is important . The first Land Day was called in 1976 in response to Israeli government plans to seize control of large areas of the Galilee region in order to expand the area 's Jewish population . Such seizures of Arab-owned lands to make way for Jewish immigration had been Israel 's modus operandi from the beginning of the state . In the three decades before 1976 , Israel had laid the foundation for their fledging " Jewish state " by confiscating one and a half million acres of Arab-owned land and demolishing some 500 Palestinian villages -- from which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1948 Nakba . <p> During those same three decades , the Palestinian citizens of Israel faced other significant hardships . They had emerged from the 1948 War shell-shocked from the horrors of the Nakba during which so many members of their families were forced to flee , so many others died , and much of their land , homes , and businesses had been seized . Following the war , these Palestinians were subjected to restrictive Emergency Defense Laws under which the Israeli government imposed curfews , collective punishment , detention without charge , and expulsion . Though nominally citizens of Israel , these Palestinians were , in reality , living under occupation in their own country . It 's important to note that after the 1967 war , Israel applied these very same Emergency Defense Laws to the newly occupied territories . <p> Despite the hardships imposed upon them , the Palestinian citizens of Israel grew in confidence , political capacity , and attachment to their Arab and Palestinian identity . They joined the Israeli political parties that would include them . They ran for and won elective office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own self-defense . And so , when , in 1976 , the government announced plans to issue new land expropriation orders in an effort to " Judaize " the Galilee , it was the proverbial " straw that broke the camel 's back . " They reacted by planning a massive nationwide general strike and protest march that would say " Enough ! " <h> Every year since 1976 , these March 30 Land Day protests have not only continued , but also spread throughout all of Palestine and in communities across the globe . They are a tribute to the continued Palestinian attachment to their land , their resilience , and their determination to rebuild their national community . <p> Because the Israelis were deathly afraid of all forms of Arab resistance , they declared the protests to be illegal . Nevertheless , tens of thousands went on strike and peacefully marched . The day was marred by Israel 's violent response in which six Palestinian citizens were killed and more than 100 wounded. ?

The convergence of these three days serves as a reminder of the ways in which the themes they evoke have been essential components of the Palestinian national identity : attachment to their land , steadfastness despite losses endured , and belief in the promise of rebirth .

Unfortunately , the situation of disparities is exacerbated in developing countries like Pakistan due to poor policy making process and its flawed implementation . <p> Education is unequally accessible to girls compared to boys . According to the World Bank , achieving universal education for girls ( 50 years ) is projected to take significantly longer than for boys ( 30 years ) , with a considerable gap in school enrollment rates between genders . Moreover , 26 percent of girls and 19 percent of boys have never been to school . The gap between boys ' and girls ' education occurs due to unequal funding , lack of female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , traditional gender roles further impede girls ' access to education , discouraging families from prioritizing their daughters ' schooling . <p> The disproportionate burden of unpaid care work falls on women , limiting their participation in the workforce . According to some estimates , the total cost of women 's unpaid care work is almost a fourth of the country 's GDP . According to the ILO , on average , men in Asia and the Pacific region spend only 28 minutes per day on unpaid labour , which is just eight percent of their total working time . Conversely , women and girls spend the bulk of their time on unpaid care work , that is , child rearing and education ; caring for elderly , sick or disabled family members ; cooking and cleaning ; fetching water and fuel supplies -- working on average anywhere between 12 to 16 hours a day . This is directly responsible for women 's low economic participation and increases the dependency ratio that in response increases the incidence of poverty more in females relative to males . <p> Financial inclusion empowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save money to combat economic shocks . And the country has one of the lowest financial inclusion rates in the world , with 79 percent of its 231 million people operating outside the formal banking system , according to the World Bank 's Global Findex Database . Whereas women are unequally positioned on the lower side of the financial divide , as only 13 percent of women have their own bank accounts , compared to 28 percent of men . <p> The World Economic Forum ranked Pakistan at third-last place in terms of economic participation and opportunity for women . Regardless of making up 49 percent of the total population , the participation rate for female workers is drastically low ( 21 percent ) which is also well below the global percentage i.e. , 39 percent . However , the country has shown improvement in the female labour force participation , but pace of progress is slow , and Pakistan is ranked 142 out of 146 countries by the Gender Gap Index 2023 . The national average unemployment rate was 6.3 percent in 2021 . In comparison , the unemployment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of males . On the whole , more than one-third of women graduates were unemployed in 2020-21 . The absence of legal protections against discrimination is limiting employment opportunities The precarious situation for women does not stop here , as the gender wage gap remains a persistent challenge . Women who are participating in labour market are earning a median wage of Rs 12,000 a month , whereas males are earning Rs 18,900 a month . One of the reasons is that there is no litigation for equal pay for work of equal value . <p> According to the Asia Development Bank ( ADB ) Report titled " How Female-Friendly Are Workplaces in Urban Pakistan ? " ( 2022 ) , 70 percent of firms sampled expressed reluctance to hire female employees , with only 20 percent of them having employed females . Among these , 62 percent of firms do not provide essential benefits such as maternity or paternity leave , pick-up and drop-off services , and supportive infrastructure like separate prayer rooms and toilets . The report also notes that as firm size increases , the likelihood of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to female labour force participation highlighted in the report is the lack of safe and affordable transportation . Dauntingly , 70 percent of women who use public transport reported experiencing unwanted advances and inappropriate behaviour from male passengers , as per ADB findings . Additionally , less than five percent of firms with female employees offer pick-up and drop-off services , leaving many women to arrange their transportation , which can be prohibitively expensive . Consequently , a significant portion of women 's earnings may be spent covering transportation costs . <p> Women are also experiencing sexual harassment at workplace despite the existence of a law . The data of Federal Ombudsman Secretariat for Protection Against Harassment exhibits that the total number of complaints against workplace harassment from 2018 to 2022 was 2,169 . Out of these , 46 percent and 26 percent of the complaints were made by women working in the private and the government sector , respectively . <p> Females who are expecting a child have to face a stern reality of a motherhood penalty . Because of a non-conducive working environment like availability of childcare facilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for pregnant women , hence they must leave their jobs . In lieu , females who are entitled to maternity leave are not getting 100 percent benefit . As per Women Business and Law ( WBL ) , Pakistan is among 42 countries which are regulating maternity leave but not providing 100 percent maternity leave benefit . <p> Besides entering and sustaining themselves in the employed labour force , females do face multiple obstacles when it comes to career advancement . According to the International Finance and Corporation and Pakistan Business Council , one in 20 women make it to senior management positions . On the other hand , women representation in government and reform making is prerequisite , however women representation in Parliament is merely 21 percent . They routinely face harassment and derogatory remarks and struggle for equal participation in the decision-making process . It 's not just governmental institutions but it is prevalent in the private sector as well . The opposite gender became insecure with talented women , and they started undermining their skills and confidence just to preserve their power . <p> It 's crucial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gender inequality can be overcome by focusing on three key dimensions : parity , equity , and equality . Parity signifies an equal enrollment of boys and girls in schools , while equity refers to strategies and processes aimed at providing fair and equal opportunities for all individuals to pursue and benefit from educational opportunities . Equality , on the other hand , entails ensuring that females and males have equal rights , freedoms , conditions , and opportunities to realize their full potential in society . We must develop policies aimed at reducing discrimination and promoting a fair and conducive work environment .

Furthermore , there was no re-measurement loss on investment carried at FVTPL in 2019 . On a gloomier note , other income contracted by a massive 97.69 percent in 2019 as HUSI sold the plot from which it earned rental income in 2018 . The absence of rental income severely squeezed its other income . The company recorded operating profit of Rs.3.154 million in 2019 with OP margin of 4.9 percent versus operating loss of Rs.65.8 million in 2018 . The company had acquired long-term loan and short-term loans from external creditors which were in the process of restructuring with overdue mark-up to be completely waived .

Cost of sales mounted by 114.71 percent in 2020 due to elevated repair &amp; maintenance expense , utility charges as well as commission paid . Gross profit grew by 57 percent in 2020 , however , it translated into lower GP margin of 72.2 percent . Administrative expense nosedived by 12.16 percent in 2020 due to lower depreciation expense . Other charges dropped by 99.7 as no impairment loss on trade debts was recorded in 2020 . Other income also slid by 98.23 percent in 2020 particularly because the gain on disposal of vehicles recorded in the previous year was missing in 2020 .

President Raisi 's call to enhance bilateral trade has been welcomed , yet there was no convincing roadmap provided by either side on how this would be achieved . <p> The agreements focused on secondary areas like judicial assistance and veterinary cooperation , while the key issues that could genuinely boost ties , such as the long-pending gas pipeline project and addressing militant concerns , were largely absent from the discussions . <p> For many , the visit by the President of Iran was a missed opportunity to discuss the militancy issue emanating from Afghanistan .

This phenomenon , where bacteria and other microbes develop immunity to the very drugs designed to kill them , is rapidly escalating into a public health crisis in Pakistan and across the world . <p> Antimicrobial Resistance poses a severe threat by enabling antimicrobial-resistant organisms to eliminate beneficial microbes , allowing resistant traits to spread among pathogens . This issue is particularly acute in low- and middle-income countries ( LMICs ) , where inadequate healthcare infrastructure and high infectious disease burdens intensify the challenge , leading to longer hospital stays , increased medical costs , and higher mortality rates . Globally , in 2019 , an estimated 4.95 million people succumbed to drug-resistant infections , with Antimicrobial Resistance directly causing 1.27 million of those deaths . Alarmingly , 1 in 5 of these deaths occurred among children under 5 years old , highlighting the vulnerability of this age group . <p> In Pakistan , unfortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2019 alone , the country witnessed 59,200 deaths directly attributable to Antimicrobial Resistance , with an additional 221,300 deaths associated with it . This translates to Pakistan having the 176th highest age-standardized mortality rate per 100,000 population associated with Antimicrobial Resistance across 204 countries . Even more concerning , the number of Antimicrobial Resistance deaths in Pakistan surpasses those caused by other major illnesses like neoplasms , respiratory infections and tuberculosis , enteric infections , diabetes and kidney diseases , and chronic respiratory diseases . Several factors contribute to this alarming situation . Overuse and misuse of antibiotics , often for viral infections where they are ineffective , fuels the development of resistant strains . The presence of counterfeit and low-quality antibiotics in the market further compromises treatment efficacy and accelerates resistance . Weak regulations and their insufficient enforcement create loopholes that allow the misuse of antibiotics to flourish . <p> Moreover , Antimicrobial Resistance compromises the immune system by allowing resistant infections to persist and spread , reducing the effectiveness of standard treatments and necessitating more complex and costly alternatives . The term " post-antibiotic era " describes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ineffective antimicrobial treatments , jeopardizing the advances in surgeries and chronic disease management . Unchecked Antimicrobial Resistance ( AMR ) poses a catastrophic threat , jeopardizing both human health and economic stability . It can lead to prolonged illnesses , extended hospital stays , and limited treatment options for severe infections . This puts a significant strain on healthcare systems , driving up costs due to the need for more expensive medications and longer treatment durations . The World Bank estimates global GDP losses from AMR could reach US$3.4 trillion annually by 2030 . Pakistan , like many countries , is not immune , facing substantial economic burdens due to escalating healthcare costs and lost productivity . Addressing this crisis requires a multi-pronged approach . To truly be effective , these strategies require a united effort across all levels . International organizations like the World Health Organization ( WHO ) play a crucial role in coordinating global research efforts , sharing best practices , and developing standardized guidelines for antibiotic use . National governments need to implement these guidelines , invest in healthcare infrastructure , and raise public awareness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be overstated . Training healthcare professionals in antimicrobial stewardship practices and providing ongoing education to both healthcare workers and the general public about the dangers of Antimicrobial Resistance and the importance of prudent antibiotic use are vital steps in combating this crisis . <p> While large-scale initiatives are essential , preventing antibiotic resistance also hinges on individual responsibility . First and foremost , using antibiotics only when truly necessary is crucial . This means consulting a doctor to confirm a bacterial infection before requesting antibiotics , and understanding that they wo n't work for viral illnesses like the common cold . Second , adhering strictly to prescribed treatments is essential . Completing the entire course of antibiotics , even if symptoms improve early , ensures all bacteria are eliminated and prevents the development of resistance . Third , avoiding self-medication with leftover antibiotics is vital . Sharing or using leftover antibiotics from previous illnesses is not only ineffective but can also contribute to resistance .

So the producers and sellers of these medicines are a well-established mafia in Pakistan notwithstanding the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the economy . <p> These medicines contain injurious ingredients or no active ingredients at all and the administration of these drugs may lead to treatment failure , exacerbation of health conditions , development of drug resistance , and even death . I remember a horrible incident involving the death of a journalist and TV anchor about four decades ago whose name was probably Idrees Baig . He was given an injection purchased from a medical store in front of Mayo Hospital Lahore which deteriorated his condition and finally his death . The production of counterfeit and spurious drugs is the most heinous crime against the state and society . But who cares ? We are the most corrupt society . The corruption at the top level of the government has had its trickle-down effect and consequently , it has almost become a vicious circle from which the exit seems almost impossible . <p> The Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan ( DRAP ) does recognize the severity of the problem and feels that this issue requires coordinated efforts involving regulatory reform , enhanced enforcement mechanisms , public awareness campaigns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counterfeit drugs and safeguard the well-being of the population . Very right but I think they conveniently neglect the fact that all the measures suggested by them are effectively neutralized by the all permeating corruption . <p> It is not only a case of people 's health being jeopardized by spurious and counterfeit drugs but there are also other mafias who are involved in destroying the health of the people to earn easy money . Adulteration of food items is another thriving business undertaken by the people bereft of humanitarian faculties . These days milk made from chemicals is also being marketed with impunity and it is very difficult to get pure milk from the milk outlets in the cities . Like drugs , the sellers earn a lot of profit and those marketing it also get a fare share of this ill-earned money at the cost of public health . <p> The rulers are busy in building their own fortunes through the in-built avenues of corruption in the system of governance and it is because of their corruption that the entire society has become afflicted with corruption and corrupt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ebb . <p> I do not subscribe to the often-preferred view that such activities are undertaken secretly at unknown places and it is difficult to eradicate the menace altogether . Only fools would give credence to that idea . I know for sure that all the police stations have their own intelligence gathering system and the Station House Officers are fully aware of the illegal activities happening in their areas . But they look the other way in spite of taking action against them or sharing information with the concerned regulatory authorities because the money makes the mare go . As I said the major factor in regard to failure in controlling crimes like this is the permeating corruption among the regulatory authorities themselves as well as the Police stations . If they were corruption-free then nobody could dare to indulge in such anti-social and anti-state activities . <p> Looking after the health of the people is the basic and constitutional obligation of the state and the governments running the state affairs . Unfortunately , the governments have absolved themselves from performing their constitutional duty by allowing private investment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a mushroom growth of private hospitals where the treatment is almost beyond the reach of poor people . The condition in the government hospitals is very pathetic wherever they exist . This situation has also contributed to a great extent to the proliferation of counterfeit and spurious drugs . <p> It is indeed a very serious and regrettable situation and I am of the considered view that there is no possibility of eliminating these scourges from society until and unless our rulers mend their ways , and reform the archaic colonial system of governance that promotes a culture of graft and entitlement . If rulers continue to indulge in corrupt practices then it will be hoping against hope to see these evils going away . I do not see any such hope in the near future . Well , I am not a pessimist but my observations are based on existing stark realities . 
@@108307236 <h> The time is over when we in schools can force our children and youth to memorize things they in future can look up on the Internet , and soon even with AI help , and more . <p> There is an ' Education Emergency ' in Pakistan , according to top leaders , including the PM , chief ministers , and others . When they use such strong words , it creates attention , indeed worries about the situation , but also hopes for corrective measures to be taken by the provinces , the central government , the private sector , and foreign donors . I shall in a few articles discuss some key education issues related to Pakistan and the world at large , also basing much on my own education research and experience on three continents , especially in poor countries . The problems vary , but many are also similar , even in rich countries -- from too much education to too little education , depending on economic , social , geographic , gender , and other factors . Thus , there is an education emergency worldwide . <p> Pakistan is amongst a handful of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The figure is said to be about 26 million in the country , and worldwide over 60 million . It sounds like an exaggeration , but it probably also include pupils who drop out before completing the short five or six-year primary school cycle . In any case , in our day and time , it is a disgrace to any country and community if not all their children get a basic education that can keep them active as children and prepare them for a better future life in a world that has become quite modern everywhere . <p> Maybe schooling was less important earlier , but today homes and communities are not organized to spend time teaching children values , traditions , local history , work skills , and more . Those who are deprived of the opportunity are bound to fall behind and remain at the bottom of the ladder . It is an unfair system as we know that talent is equally distributed among all , but , alas , opportunity is not . And , it is also a problem for the country ; we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often compulsory , for two or three hundred years . <p> To some extent , Pakistan , being a Muslim country , is not as bad off as it would otherwise have been ; the religious institutions help with some teaching , especially about faith and moral issues , mainly for boys . In addition , in rural areas and in many urban areas , too , children are brought up learning the trade and work from their parents . If done well , it has aspects similar to apprenticeship and vocational training . Everywhere , girls more than boys , are required to take part in household chores . Child labour , which is common in many poor countries , has no or very limited learning aspects to it ; it is always repetitive and routine . There is a big difference between helping parents or other family members , as children want to do , and working for strangers for some small money or just accommodation . On the other extreme , schools have become too focused on bookish learning , and many children are not necessarily academically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curriculum ' that the school teaches them is that they are not as good as they should be , even losers . <p> I believe in basic education for all children and youth , but I also think that we have gone far too far in forcing all children to spend almost all their time , year in and year out , at school , with a too broad curriculum . Whereas many younger children should be allowed to combine play and learning , older children and youth should be allowed to combine learning and work , and they should be given more freedom to select and choose what to do themselves . In many ways , the standard school everywhere is made for the convenience of teachers and adults , not for the students and their learning needs . It also seems that has become more suited for girls than boys . <p> I believe that when Pakistan now looks more seriously into the education sector , for the first time , it is mainly because of the embarrassingly high number of out-of-school children , and an emerging realization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government schools . Also , we must admit that much of the curriculum is irrelevant , or not as relevant as it should be . Even in Pakistan , which spends a smaller percentage of BNP on education than most countries , still the cost of education is high with less social and individual returns than it should have . More of the same will thus be wasteful . We stand at a crossroads and must consider what kind of education we really want . Education is the most important thing in any country , for peace and development . Yet , not any type of education , and today much of the content and organization is wrong . The current ' Education Emergency ' situation gives us an opportunity to review and reconsider the whole education system -- in Pakistan and the whole world for that matter . <p> The time is over when we in schools can force our children and youth to memorize things they in future can look up on the Internet , and soon even with AI help , and more . The workers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group employment , need to find answers and solutions to questions themselves , even such that we do n't know how to formulate . The innovativeness and creativeness needed in future , seems to be far away from what schools do today ; on top of it is too costly and take away time from more sensible activities . Today and in the future , it is the working life rather than the school that can teach most of these issues , or they do it in collaboration in arenas where all the teachers and learners work together . We should be able to say that young people become successful and innovative workers because of their schooling , not in spite of it . <p> Still , today 's school does have some important functions , certainly as for the basic skills learning in literacy , the three Rs , and to some extent , how to think about and analyze issues . That will be the main task of tomorrow 's education , which should also focus on life skills and the ability to live happy lives and look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The school must be a place where all children and youth like to be and feel successful and happy . If a school can not cater for every different and unique child , with its aspirations and curiosities , it is not worth the name of school . In the West , in Sweden , I think it is , as many as a fifth or a quarter leave primary school with a certificate that say they have passed ; they have failed , being ineligible for further education and most jobs , too . It is the education system that has failed , not the child or youth . <p> It is important that Pakistan considers what kind of education it really wants in the future , how much , and in what forms . In my next articles , I shall present some suggestions , which will also include a massive literacy and general knowledge campaign for the country , using distance education , NGOs , CBOs , companies , and more -- for the 26 million out-of-school children and for the many young and older adults @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us always remember , they are as talented as you and I , even more . <p> Atle HetlandThe writer is a senior Norwegian social scientist with experience from university , diplomacy and development aid .

FTO Advisor Dr Waqar Chaudhry disclosed this while addressing an awareness session for business community arranged under the aegis of Coordinator to FTO Meher Kashif Younis , here on Sunday . He said that FTO 's all proposals are based on the solid suggestions solicited from presidents of chambers , stakeholders and leading trade associations at an important meeting of central advisory committee . <p> In order to promote entrepreneurship and corporate culture , it has been proposed that the rate of corporate tax may be reduced from 29 percent to 20 percent . Although , tax credit is available to startups , but corporate tax rate is too high for a company aging three years .

Recently , fee for filing of appeals have been drastically increased putting extra burden on taxpayers . Therefore , it has been proposed that appeal fee may be reduced to affordable level . He said a tax credit at 10 percent was available for investments in plant and machinery replacement , and business modernisation due to the fact that such investment creates industrial growth and job opportunities . However , this was withdrawn without any logic . It has been proposed that tax at 10 percent be restored under section 65B to attract investment . <p> Dr Waqar explained that the salaried class is most hit by the increasing cost of living . The utilities and traveling cost has increased manifold , therefore , it has been proposed that the limit of income not chargeable to tax be enhanced to Rs1,200,000 from existing Rs600,000 . It was also proposed that all income must be taxed irrespective of source of income which will increase tax collection . He said recently introduced Tajir Dost Scheme specifies payment of minimum tax as advance tax on a monthly basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Therefore , it has been proposed that payment of minimum advance tax may be amended to annual or biannual basis instead of monthly basis . <p> He said filling tax returns permission application kept pending unattended and the registered person is unable to file its monthly sales tax returns , therefore , it is proposed that the application for filing of Sales Tax Returns may be automated and be processed within 15 days of filing of such application . He said the terms of property developer , property promoters , builders have neither been defined under the Sales Tax Act , 1990 not in Islamabad Capital Territory ( Tax on Services ) Ordinance , 2000 , therefore , may be defined under section 2 of the Ordinance as proposed accordingly .

@@108894231 <h> The blasphemy laws in Pakistan are dividing the population , disturbing the social fabric of the community , and undermining diversity , inclusivity , and the rule of law . <p> Another appalling incident of blasphemy took place in Sargodha , Punjab , accusing a 70-year-old Christian of desecrating the scriptures of the Holy Quran on May 25 , 2024 . The accused was not only subjected to torture and lynching but also had his house and small shoe-making factory vandalized . The enraged group of fanatics broke into and burned his home and factory , looting shoes from the factory . The police have arrested about 20-25 people and filed cases against 400 unidentified individuals , who may be released on bail later . Sadly , the seriously injured 70-year-old Christian has also been charged with blasphemy due to the pressure from clerics , and his bail is unlikely to see any hearing date . If heard , he shall not be released due to the complications of blasphemy laws and the risk to his life outside of jail . In either case , the charges of blasphemy put pressure on the Christian family , restraining them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence . <p> Moreover , the pattern of mob reactions highlights that seemingly every one in two Pakistanis has symptoms of paranoia or psychosis disorders . This mentality underlies the notion that " Why courts , why not mob courts ? " Thus , every instigation ends in a " Mob Court " aimed at justice through assaulting , burning , or killing anyone accused of blasphemy . The mob justifies such violence as an act " For God 's Sake . " <p> The incident in Sargodha 's Mujahid Colony mirrors the Jaranwala incident , demonstrating Pakistan 's failure to learn from such episodes of mass hysteria . This indicates either the state 's heedlessness towards minority rights or its vested interest in blasphemy politics , which relies on the weak belief systems and illiteracy of the people , followed by extremism . However , the state has the ability to prevent similar incidents from happening again in the future . But the irony is the state itself contributes to promoting hatred against non-Muslims through curricula while showing no concern over forced conversions , abductions , and assaults on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further marginalized already vulnerable minorities . Blasphemy and sedition charges have frequently been used as tools to suppress those who challenge the status quo and those in power . <p> Lynching to death or serving death penalties for speaking their mind is alarming , but more alarming is people taking the law into their own hands merely upon allegations of blasphemy , as happened recently in Jaranwala and Sargodha . Although blasphemy laws are intended to bring the blasphemers into court to face proper trial and prosecution , people handle the cases extrajudicially , often misusing the blasphemy laws for personal revenge . This misuse indicates that Pakistani society is rapidly moving towards moral decay . <p> The blasphemy laws in Pakistan are dividing the population , disturbing the social fabric of the community , and undermining diversity , inclusivity , and the rule of law . Furthermore , the weaponization of religion and blasphemy laws by the state has contributed to the high-handedness of extremist groups . Religious clerics weaponize blasphemy laws to influence the state , while the state weaponizes Islam for political purposes . These laws are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and preventing them from engaging in progressive activities or debates . Additionally , these laws are misused by many to settle personal rivalries . What can one expect from a state where governors are killed for criticizing blasphemy laws ? How can criticism of a legislative act amount to committing blasphemy ? <p> Historically , blasphemy laws ( Sections 295 , 296 , and 298 of the Pakistan Penal Code ) were originally established by the British colonial government in India to safeguard the religious sentiments of Muslims and Hindus in the subcontinent from the defiling of worship and burial places . However , after the partition of the subcontinent in 1947 , Pakistan adopted these blasphemy laws without any changes until 1980 . Under the Islamization project of dictator General Zia-ul-Haq , five more sections ( 295-B , 295-C , 298-A , 298-B , and 298-C of the Pakistan Penal Code ) were introduced , all evidently targeting minority groups . Section 298-B deals with the " use of derogatory remarks in respect of holy personages , " punishable with three years ' imprisonment , a fine , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ target the Shia sect of Muslims due to ideological differences with the majority Sunni group over companions of the Prophet . Section 298-C targets Ahmadis , restraining them from portraying themselves as Muslims . The addition of Section 295-C was the most controversial , as it does not clarify or define what acts , words , or behaviors constitute defiling the sanctity of the Prophet . These laws are not only vague and ambiguous but are also intricate , with significant potential for misuse . Therefore , their interpretation remains manipulative and needs to be addressed or declared unconstitutional , as they fail to guide the general public regarding the definite behaviors that constitute blasphemy . <p> The legality of the later-adopted sections -- 295-B , 295-C , 298-A , 298-B , and 298-C -- is also questionable because these laws were enacted during the 1980s when the country was under martial law . Thus , technically , these laws could be considered unconstitutional . Additionally , integrating religion into legislation requires utmost care , as it risks influencing laws for the sake of religion and religious scholars . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leading to an upsurge in such cases . Furthermore , the institutionalization of the legal system into separate courts , such as the Federal Sharia Court and the Supreme Court , allows the legal system to be swayed by religious scholars . <p> Many countries around the world , such as France ( partly in 1881 and fully in 2016 ) , Ireland in 2010 , England and Wales in 2008 , and Scotland in 2021 , have abolished blasphemy laws . In contrast , according to reports , Pakistan has the world 's second-strictest blasphemy laws after Iran . When a state endorses one religion , its minorities are prone to face the risk of prosecution . <p> It is beyond comprehension why the misapplication or misuse of blasphemy laws in Pakistan has not been addressed . At the very least , there should be legislation to tackle the " Mob Courts " and to legally punish those who falsely accuse others of blasphemy . Instead , the justice system in Pakistan arrests and holds trials of accused persons merely on false allegations of blasphemy . This trend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make them bailable . Additionally , our society is in dire need of morality , tolerance , and love , which can be fostered through peace and interfaith initiatives aimed at promoting respect for all religions and religious sentiments .

@@109027240 <h> SBP reduces policy rate to 20.5pc after cut in inflation <p> ISLAMABAD - The Monetary Policy Committee ( MPC ) of the State Bank of Pakistan ( SBP ) has reduced the policy rate by 150 bps to 20.5 percent following the reduction in inflation rate . <p> " The Monetary Policy Committee ( MPC ) decided to reduce the policy rate by 150 bps to 20.5 percent , effective from June 11 , 2024 . The MPC noted that while the significant decline in inflation since February was broadly in line with expectations , the May outturn was better than anticipated earlier , " said SBP on Monday . <p> The Committee assessed that underlying inflationary pressures are also subsiding amidst tight monetary policy stance , supported by fiscal consolidation . This is reflected by continued moderation in core inflation and ease in inflation expectations of both consumers and businesses in the latest surveys . At the same time , the MPC viewed some upside risks to the near-term inflation outlook associated with the upcoming budgetary measures and uncertainty regarding future energy price adjustments . Notwithstanding these risks and today 's decision , the Committee noted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep inflationary pressures in check . <p> The MPC noted the following key developments since its last meeting . First , real GDP growth remained moderate at 2.4 percent in FY24 as per provisional data , with subdued recovery in industry and services partially offsetting the strong growth in agriculture . Second , reduction in the current account deficit has helped improve the FX reserves to around $9 billion despite large debt repayments and weak official inflows . The government has also approached the IMF for an Extended Fund Facility program , which is likely to unlock financial inflows that will help in further build-up of FX buffers . Lastly , international oil prices have declined , whereas non-oil commodity prices have continued to inch up . <p> Based on these developments , the Committee , on balance , viewed that it is now an appropriate time to reduce the policy rate . The Committee noted that the real interest rate still remains significantly positive , which is important to continue guiding inflation to the medium-term target of 5 -- 7 percent . The Committee also emphasized that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolving developments related to the inflation outlook . <p> Latest estimates indicate real GDP growth at 2.1 percent in Q3-FY24 against a contraction of 1.1 percent in the same quarter last year . While agriculture was already showing strong growth , industry also witnessed positive growth in Q3 . Also , initial growth estimates for both Q1 and Q2 for FY24 were revised upward . Taking into account the developments in the first nine months , FY24 growth is provisionally estimated by PBS at 2.4 percent against a contraction of 0.2 percent in FY23 . Almost two-thirds of this recovery was explained by improvement in the agriculture sector . These developments are in line with the MPC 's earlier expectations . For FY25 , the MPC expects economic growth to remain moderate . This assessment takes into account the impact of expected moderation in agriculture output and ongoing stabilization policies . <p> The current account posted a surplus for the third consecutive month in April on the back of robust growth in remittances and exports , which more than offset the uptick in imports . During July-April FY24 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same period , exports grew by 10.6 percent , mainly driven by increased quantum of rice and HVA textile exports . Conversely , imports decreased by 5.3 percent during the same period due to lower international commodity prices , better domestic agriculture output and moderate economic activity . Workers ' remittances also remained robust in recent months , reaching an all-time high of $3.2 billion in May 2024 . The resultant lower current account deficit , along with improved FDI and the disbursement of SBA tranche in April , has facilitated ongoing large debt repayments and supported the SBP 's FX reserves . Going forward , the Committee stressed that timely mobilization of financial inflows is essential to meet the external financing requirements and further strengthen FX buffers for the country to effectively respond to any external shocks and support sustainable economic growth . <p> Fiscal indictors continued to show improvement during July-March FY24 . The primary surplus increased to 1.5 percent of GDP , while the overall deficit remained almost at last year 's level . A large part of this improvement reflected the impact of increase in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower energy sector subsidies . Considering there has been limited progress in addressing the structural weaknesses to broaden the tax base and initiate energy sector reforms , FY25 budgetary measures are also expected to be largely rate-based . In this backdrop , the Committee emphasized that fiscal consolidation through broadening the tax base and reforming loss-making public sector enterprises would help achieve fiscal sustainability on a more durable basis . This is also imperative to keep inflation on a downward trajectory and contain external account pressures . <p> The broad money ( M2 ) growth decelerated to 15.2 percent y/y on May 24 , 2024 from 17.1 percent as of end-March 2024 . This reduction was primarily due to deceleration in growth of net domestic assets of the banking system . On the other hand , the growth contribution of net foreign assets in M2 remained positive . From the liability side , deposits remained the mainstay in M2 growth , while currency in circulation growth decelerated . As a result , reserve money growth observed a steep decline from 10.0 percent to 4.3 percent during the period . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the tight monetary policy stance and have favourable implications for the inflation outlook . <p> Headline inflation decelerated to 11.8 percent in May 2024 from 17.3 percent in April . Besides the continued tight monetary policy stance , this sharp reduction was also driven by a sizeable decline in prices of wheat , wheat flour , and some other major food items , along with the downward adjustment in administered energy prices . Core inflation also decelerated to 14.2 percent from 15.6 percent . The Committee noted that the near-term inflation outlook is susceptible to risks emanating from the FY25 budgetary measures and future adjustments in electricity and gas tariffs . The MPC foresees a risk of inflation to rise significantly in July 2024 from current levels , before trending down gradually during FY25 . The MPC also observed that sharp wheat price reductions have historically proved to be temporary . On balance , the Committee assessed that the current monetary policy stance remains appropriate to ensure that inflation stays on a downward trajectory .

The answer to this question entails comparing the dynamics of the cold war with those of the present era . <p> The adversaries during the cold war were not two nations or even ordinary blocs but two systems , each based on a philosophy or doctrine , which competed for supremacy in the post World War II era . On the one hand was communism spearheaded by the USSR ; on the other was capitalism led by the US . The basis of communism was dialectical materialism or Marxism , which saw the establishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of production as the inevitable destiny of mankind . <p> The basis of capitalism was liberalism . Its cardinal principles were the institution of private property and its corollary profit maximization , the individual 's right to choose , minimum government intervention in economic activity , and multiparty democracy . According to Marx , the interests of the capitalist and working classes could never be reconciled and the victory of the latter must be built on the annihilation of the former . Hence , the clash between the two blocs representing two mutually antagonistic systems was carved in stone . <p> Thus the USSR refused to join the 1944 US-sponsored Brettonwoods Agreement , which provided for setting up institutions for global economic governance . Moscow thus did not join the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , the World Bank , and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , the three flagship institutions of the Brettonwoods or capitalist system .

The West was hostile towards the rise of communism in another country the size of a continent . This hostility was sharpened by the Korean War in which the US and China fought on opposite sides . <p> On the whole , as opposed to the USSR with which they concluded the Treaty of Friendship , Alliance , and Mutual Assistance in 1950 , the Chinese espoused peaceful coexistence with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' . The ancient Chinese principle of universal harmony and an inherent disdain for imperialism were powerful forces behind that stance .

China 's massive trade surplus vis-a-vis the US , which is attributed to its ' unfair ' trade and investment practices , has hobbled the growth of the American economy and dislocated import-competing sectors , ushering in job losses .

In the latest move , Joe Biden has slapped duties on import of electric vehicles ( up to 100 per cent ) , solar cells ( up to 50 per cent ) , advanced batteries ( up to 25 per cent ) , medical equipment and steel products from China , thus following in the footsteps of his adversary Donald Trump . The action has been taken in the name of fair trade and protecting American workers , as the country braces for the November presidential election . <p> The move 's long-term economic impact aside , it sends out a clear message to Beijing that whether it 's Trump ( Republican ) or Biden ( Democrat ) at the helm , the US will continue to punish China . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tariffs as ' political manipulation , ' while the foreign ministry spokesperson termed them ' a naked act of bullying ' .

@@109060237 <h> How to fix the power sector <h> These contracts stipulate that you must purchase a minimum and fixed quantity of power from the IPPs <p> ByHafiz Ahsaan Ahmad Khokhar <p> June 12 , 2024 <p> A representational image of a transmission tower , also known as an electricity pylon. -- AFP/File <p> Power purchase agreements ( PPAs ) with Independent Power Producers ( IPPs ) , made under various regimes without careful consideration of the potential consequences , are the primary cause of Pakistan 's power crises . <p> These contracts stipulate that you must purchase a minimum and fixed quantity of power from the IPPs . The tariff structure indicates that fuel charges , under the ' take or pay ' contracts that Pakistan has embraced , account for one-third of the total expenses of a typical thermal IPP , while fixed charges make up two thirds of the total costs of these IPPs . The main drawback of these charges is that most of them were awarded without first seeking competitive bids and due diligence . <p> Because of the IPP agreements , energy users already receive the worst form of invoices in the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their bills . In the past 15 years , the country has lost approximately Rs5,082 billion due to the governments ' inability to control the circular debt , amounting to an annual loss of Rs370 billion . Since July 2018 , the power purchase price has climbed by 95.82 per cent . The spanning period of these IPPS will end around 2050 . <p> Pakistan has to make investments in renewable energy sources like hydroelectric , solar , and wind power in order to diversify its energy mix . Reducing energy waste and transmission losses , governance , cost and infrastructure can also be achieved by putting energy-efficient technologies , including smart grids and metering systems , into use . <p> As of January 31 , 2024 Pakistan possessed an installed power generation capacity of 46,035MW , comprising 28,811MW of thermal power , 10,635MW of hydroelectric power , 1,838MW of wind , 882MW of solar power , 249MW of bagasse , and 3,620MW of nuclear power . While the transmission and distribution capacity is stopped at about 22,000MW , the greatest total demand from residential and industrial estates is close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the height of demand . The nation 's peak demand is significantly less than its installed capacity of 46,035 MW ; hence the additional 9,000MW that is needed can not be transmitted because of poor transmission . <p> Pakistan has been blessed by hydropower potential exceeding 60,000 megawatts . But only a small portion -- 10-15 per cent -- of this potential has been realized . Pakistan is expected to have wind power potential of about 346,000MW by the World Bank . <p> Pakistan attempted to attract private investment in the power industry during the severe energy shortages of the late 1980s and early 1990s , which is when IPPs first appeared in the country . Pakistan launched its Power Policy in 1994 with the goal of luring private capital into the electricity industry by means of competitive IPP project bidding . <p> The federal government issued 70 MOUs and Letters of Intent ( LOIs ) to IPPs in 1994 , marking the beginning of the nation 's greatest energy conservation programme with the goal of producing 13,000MW . There are currently 49 IPPs in Pakistan , of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiencing serious problems in the power sector after that . <p> Several reports state that IPPs had a fixed tariff of seven cents in dollar terms , without considering the country 's currency depreciation in the future . The investment payback period was of 2-4 years . Interestingly , under the 1994 Power Policy , 16 out of 17 IPPs invested a total of Rs52 billion in capital and made profits exceeding Rs417 billion . <p> There is no doubt that take-or-pay IPPs are reportedly placing a heavy financial strain on residential , commercial , and industrial customers . These reports are grounded in actual facts . While an additional 17,000MW of generation capacity is being planned , the industrial sector 's electricity use has decreased by 25 per cent as a result of exorbitant power prices . <p> Six IPPs had a remaining life of six to ten years under the 1994 generation policy , while the Kot Addu Power Company had a one-year lifespan . Similarly , 12 IPPs had 14 -- 21 years left on their lives under the 2002 policy . There are 12 -- 19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) programme from 2006 . This applies to 19 IPPs . Under the 2006 policy , the eight bagasse-based projects from 2013 had a remaining life of four to twenty-eight years . But it was a bad idea to prolong the terms of the contracts for IPPs established under the 1994 and 2002 programmes . <p> Notwithstanding the foregoing , Pakistan has nonetheless seen overcapacity in the electricity generation sector as a result of the construction of IPPs without sufficient demand forecasts . Consequently , even in cases where the generated electricity is n't fully utilized , the government is required to provide capacity payments to IPPs . The nation 's finances are strained by these excess capacity payments , which also add to circular debt . Over the past five years , capacity costs have gone from one-third to two-thirds due to increasing generation capacity . <p> Without a doubt , the exorbitant cost of electricity under IPP contracts , along with the spiraling capacity payments and finance costs associated with cyclical debt , have rendered the country 's electrical supply unviable for customers and the economy . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 2023 -- 24 , the electricity distribution businesses experienced losses and inefficiencies of Rs77 billion , compared to Rs62 billion during the same time in 2022 -- 23 . DISCOs ' under-recoveries increased to Rs149 billion in the first half of 2023 -- 24 from Rs62 billion in the same period of 2022 -- 23 ; as of June 30 , however , their cumulative under-recoveries were Rs236 billion . <p> As early as possible , the federal government must begin conducting forensic audits of these IPPs , including investment forensic audits , in order to look into any abnormalities in their financial transactions . There needs to be a technical audit to evaluate the output and efficiency of power plants owned by IPPs ; a financial audit to carefully examine the financial transactions and records ; a fuel audit to confirm that IPPs ' reported fuel usage and expenses are accurate ; and performance audits to assess how well IPPs are carrying out their allocated duties . They also include investment , tax , generation capacity , heat rate , and performance benchmarking audits . <p> The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using capacity payment fees based on a ' take or pay ' option if these audits show any substantial legal or technical discrepancies . Parallel to this , the federal government ought to renegotiate contracts with IPPs in order to resolve matters like tariff changes , payment conditions , or contractual obligations , as the issue of circular debt and capacity payment costs is becoming worse . Of course , there are provisions in IPP contracts that allow verdicts from international arbitrations to be implemented ; nonetheless , taking action now is just as crucial as waiting until it is too late . <p> With the help of these audits , Pakistan can improve the power sector 's overall efficacy and transparency by finding and fixing any irregularities or inefficiencies in IPP operations ; negotiating more fair terms and prices with IPPs ; recovering any overpayments or excess profits made by IPPs ; and transparency of the power sector . <p> A variety of further measures could be taken , including converting the fundamental tariff of IPPs from dollars to rupees and launching the country 's alternate energy resources by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Similarly , IPP owners should be paid their profits in Pakistani rupees instead of US dollars . Instead of using a take-or-pay contract , the country might save Rs5,500 billion by just exchanging currencies . <p> Given the alarming situation , it is imperative to review or renegotiate the IPPs Power Purchase Agreements immediately in order to prevent Pakistan 's economy from collapsing . <p> The writer is a practising advocate of the Supreme Court of Pakistan with 25 years of legal standing .

With the world 's biggest population and vast , diverse landscapes , vote counting becomes a prolonged process . In the recent elections in the country , Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) secured more seats than the opposition alliance -- and yet the results were surprising . <p> The BJP 's main slogan , ' Ab ki baar , 400 paar ' ( This time , over 400 ) , was a bold call to send more than 400 candidates to the 543-member Indian parliament . Despite Modi 's high-stakes campaign and the exit polls predicting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This outcome suggests that the electorate delivered a sobering message , curbing the party 's overconfidence . <p> Take the Faizabad constituency , for instance . Located in Uttar Pradesh and encompassing the city of Ayodhya , where Modi inaugurated Ram Mandir with grand fanfare on a contentious site , the BJP still faced a significant defeat . Despite the spectacle and fulfillment of a long-standing party promise , pressing issues like unemployment and rising prices dominated voter concerns . A survey across 19 states revealed that , while 22 per cent admired the temple inauguration , only 8.0 per cent prioritized it . Unemployment , on the other hand , was the primary concern for 27 per cent . <p> These election results hint at potential change . The Indian electorate has revived a viable opposition in parliament , a prospect that seemed distant amid predictions of a BJP landslide . With possible shifting alliances in the coming days , the political landscape might still hold surprises . However , all this political manoeuvring may seem trivial in the face of pressing issues like overheating and water shortages threatening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent Modi 's party from winning an outright majority under these conditions took everyone by surprise . And it suggests that even when would-be authoritarians attempt to tilt the playing field , voters can and will state their will , no matter the autocrat 's preferences . The beauty of an election is that politicians have to go to the people , and the people get an opportunity to express their anxieties and their perspectives . <p> Whether this election result signifies a complete rejection of Modi 's anti-Muslim campaign will become clear over time . However , it is unmistakably a rejection of his economic policies . These policies have been disastrous for vast segments of the Indian population , particularly the poor and socially marginalized groups . <p> Since 2014 , wealth and income inequality have surged , unemployment has reached record highs , and rising prices have burdened ordinary people . Numerous surveys reported in the media have documented these issues , yet the central government failed to implement remedial measures , relying instead on its strategy of polarizing Hindus against Muslims to secure votes .

The BJP 's campaign emphasized a zero-tolerance approach to terrorism , subtly underscored by references to the ' 2016 surgical strike ' and ' 2019 airstrikes , ' signaling its firm stance on Pakistan . <p> However , the most significant barrier to normalized relations between these neighbours remains the contentious Kashmir valley , a picturesque but volatile region over which they have fought multiple wars since gaining independence from British rule in 1947 . Relations further deteriorated in 2019 when Modi 's Hindu nationalist government revoked Article 370 of the Indian constitution , stripping Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir of its partial autonomy . <p> Despite the formal diplomatic freeze , a glimmer of cooperation emerged in February 2021 when the two countries renewed a two-decade-old ceasefire agreement along the 725km ( 450 miles ) Line of Control , the de-facto border dividing Kashmir .

If Modi softens his rhetoric and extends a hand of friendship , Pakistan should reciprocate . Restoring full diplomatic relations and easing the visa process , particularly for family visits , could be initial steps . A potential meeting of both prime ministers at the next SCO summit could further these efforts . Reviving backchannel and Track II diplomacy , even if initially limited to preliminary discussions , is crucial . <p> While Pakistan should maintain its principled support for the Kashmiri struggle for self-determination , other issues can be addressed if India adopts a more flexible stance .

@@109331238 <p> ISLAMABAD : For the first time since nuclear tests by arch-rivals India and Pakistan in 1998 , India has been reported by the Stockholm Inter ? national Peace Research Institute ( SIPRI ) to possess more nuclear warheads than Pakistan , albeit by a slim margin of two warheads . <p> The report 's findings , released during the Eid holidays , come at a time of heightened concern over the escalating global reliance on nuclear weapons , fuelled by intensifying geopolitical tensions . <p> Historically , Western assessments , including those from SIPRI and the International Panel on Fissile Materials ( IPFM ) , have shown Pakistan maintaining a slight lead over India in terms of nuclear arsenal size , generally by a margin of five to 10 weapons . <p> However , the latest assessments for 2023 have depicted a change , with India now marginally ahead . <p> These assessments are primarily based on satellite imagery of uranium enrichment facilities and plutonium production plants . The operational history of these facilities provides critical data , yet the specifics of the methodologies and metrics used by SIPRI and IPFM remain largely undisclosed , raising questions about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pakistan maintain a high degree of opacity regarding their nuclear programmes , rarely commenting on or validating Western nuclear assessments . This lack of transparency makes it challenging to verify the accuracy of the reported figures . <p> It is claimed that Western estimates of South Asian nuclear capabilities are influenced by political motivations . This perspective is supported by the context of India 's broader nuclear programme and geopolitical posture . India , having tested its first nuclear device in 1974 and possessing a comprehensive nuclear triad , logically would not ever lag behind Pakistan -- a country with a relatively younger nuclear programme . <p> India 's extensive air , ground , and sea-based nuclear delivery systems , along with one of the world 's largest indigenous uranium reserves , support a robust nuclear capability . <p> According to the report , neither India nor Pakistan have nuclear weapons deployed at this time . However , India is reportedly shifting towards a strategy where some nuclear warheads are pre-attached to their launchers during peacetime . <p> Pakistani stockpile <p> As of January 2024 , Pakistan , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warheads , consistent with its previous year 's estimates . These warheads , as per the report , are distributed across Pakistan 's emerging nuclear triad , which includes aircraft , ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles , and sea-launched cruise missiles . <p> Pakistan 's ongoing development of new delivery systems and the accumulation of fissile materials indicate potential growth in its nuclear capabilities over the next decade . <p> Pakistan 's military doctrine does not adhere to a no-first-use ( NFU ) policy , reserving the right to pre-emptive nuclear strikes , particularly due to perceived conventional force imbalances with India . This stance , SIPRI report noted , is emphasised by its focus on non-strategic nuclear weapons as a counter to India 's ' Cold Start ' doctrine , which involves rapid military mobilisation . <p> The air-delivered component of Pakistan 's nuclear force , the report said , includes a small stockpile of nuclear gravity bombs and developing cruise missiles like the Ra'ad ( Hatf-8 ) , which enhances the nuclear stand-off capability of PAF at ranges between 350 and 600 km . Combat aircraft such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered potential nuclear-delivery platforms , though their exact roles remain unconfirmed . <p> Pakistan 's land-based nuclear arsenal , it said , includes an estimated 126 short- and medium-range missile systems . This arsenal features several operational missile types , including the solid-fuelled Shaheen series and the liquid-fuelled Ghauri missiles . The Shaheen-III , a longer-range missile still in development , has been tested but is not yet deployed . Additionally , Pakistan is exploring MIRV technology with the developmental Ababeel missile , likely in response to India 's advanced missile defences . <p> For its sea-based nuclear capabilities , Pakistan is said to be developing the Babur-3 submarine-launched cruise missile ( SLCM ) , aimed at equipping its Agosta-90B submarines , thereby advancing its second-strike capabilities . Military analysts claim Pakistan does not yet have a submarine platform to use nuclear weapons and clearly lags behind India in possessing assured second-strike capability . <p> A separate report by International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons ( ICAN ) , citing a 2016 parliamentary report , claimed that Pakistan spends about 10pc of its total military spending on its nuclear arsenal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its nuclear programme , which equals to an expenditure of $1,924 per minute . <p> Indian inventory <p> Indian nuclear arsenal as of January 2024 , according to SIPRI , comprises approximately 172 nuclear weapons , showing a minor increase from the previous year . <p> These weapons are part of India 's developing nuclear triad , which includes aircraft , land-based missiles , and nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines ( SSBNs ) . Traditionally , India has kept nuclear warheads and launchers separate during peacetime , but recent actions suggest a shift towards mating some warheads with launchers in peacetime . <p> India 's nuclear strategy primarily aims to deter Pakistan and China . Initially , India 's shorter-range nuclear weapons targeted Pakistan , but with the development of longer-range missiles , China has also become a focus . India maintains an NFU policy , established in 1999 , with modifications in 2003 that include potential nuclear responses to non-nuclear attacks . <p> India 's airborne nuclear capability includes aircraft like the Mirage 2000H , Jaguar IS , and Rafale , with about 48 nuclear gravity bombs assigned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ballistic missiles , with newer models like the Agni-P nearing deployment . The sea-based leg of the triad is expanding with four to six SSBNs planned , enhancing India 's second-strike capabilities . India has achieved intercontinental ranges and with upcoming Agni-VI and Surya missiles it will be able to target any country in the world . <p> Overall , India is increasing the readiness of its nuclear forces and may be shifting towards a counterforce posture , which aims at targeting an adversary 's nuclear arsenal pre-emptively . <p> ICAN 's report estimated that India spent $2.7bn on nuclear programme in 2023 , which equalled an expenditure of $5,057 per minute . <p> Global context <p> The report revealed that all nine nuclear-armed countries , the US , Russia , the UK , France , China , India , Pakistan , North Korea and Israel , are modernising their arsenals and deploying new nuclear-capable weapon systems . <p> Globally , the total number of nuclear warheads is estimated at 12,121 , with 9,585 of these in military stockpiles ready for potential use . About 2,100 warheads are maintained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , primarily by Russia and the US , with China recently joining this high-alert grouping . <p> The report underscores the persistent modernization efforts by nuclear states , which not only include upgrades to existing arsenals but also the development of new technologies such as multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles . This capability , pursued by India , Pakistan , and North Korea , could lead to a rapid increase in the number of deployable warheads and the potential for more widespread destruction in conflict scenarios .

@@109331240 <p> THE finance bill or proposed budget for the next fiscal year has refused to commit any resources or even set the national direction for climate resilience . <p> It has failed to acknowledge that Pakistan is one of the world 's most climate-vulnerable countries , and perhaps the least prepared . It has missed , once again , the opportunity to determine the course of action for Pakistan 's sustainable economic development . Worse , the proposed budget has not outlined a vision for climate-resilient investments . <p> The finance bill has not shown any particular appetite for institutional or policy reforms that could help stop the economic bleeding caused by repeated climate-induced disasters or the slow onset that is threatening GDP growth rate and per capita incomes . Ironically , despite heavy losses , Pakistan has not explicitly adopted climate considerations into the budgetary process . <p> The government has , instead , opted for a simplistic formula for generating tax and non-tax revenues , particularly by cutting subsidies .

The office of the Accountant General Pakistan Revenues has not climate-proofed reporting of federal transactions , nor has the Auditor General upgraded its auditing standards and disclosure rules . <p> The FBR is not tracking and reporting climate-related tax expenditures , nor has it supported the development of climate-resilient infrastructure by ensuring that tax policies and regulations promote investments in climate-resilient projects and infrastructure . In fact , none of the major government players have strengthened climate-smart budgeting by embedding climate considerations into their processes . These lacunae are mirrored in the provincial budgets . <p> We must integrate climate considerations into the overall budget-planning processes . <p> Some of Pakistan 's neighbours have begun to climate-proof their annual budgets .

As part of broader efforts to mainstream climate finance across its public financial management systems , Bangladesh set up the Climate Change Trust Fund in 2010 with a governmental equity of $350 million . Designed to help communities recover from climate disasters by supporting the construction of houses in cyclone-affected areas , the CCTF has supported the construction of embankments and provision of solar home systems . <p> While our finance bill has announced the government 's intent to set up a similar fund , following the Climate Change Act of 2017 , the finance minister has clouded its future by not committing any equity from the government , without which it will remain a fictional fund . <p> Another example is the Climate Fiscal Framework that Bangladesh has implemented since 2014 . Revised in 2022 , the CFF emphasises institutional coordination between the planning , finance and other divisions to ensure effective implementation of climate fiscal policies and programmes . The CFF is designed to ensure that their vulnerabilities are integrated into national development and resource mobilisation strategies . It made way in 2018 for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenditures , enabling them to identify , classify , and mark climate-relevant allocations in the budget system . There is a lesson for Pakistan : such tracking systems not only help improve policymaking to address climate vulnerabilities , but also add to transparency and accountability in its budgeting . <p> A climate-smart budget would typically rest on five anchors : i ) an assessment of the potential impacts of climate change on different sectors and regions , ii ) a mechanism to track and report on related expenditures , iii ) an alignment with national policies and targets , such as the Nationally Determined Contributions , iv ) prioritising resource allocation for mitigation , adaptation , and resilience-building , and v ) accessing domestic and international climate finance to fill the resource gaps . <p> In other words , rather than treating it as a stand-alone issue , Pakistan needs to integrate its climate considerations into the overall budget-planning processes .

This approach focuses on reducing debt burdens without necessarily addressing environmental and climate concerns . Debt-for-climate swaps , on the other hand , involve converting debt into funds dedicated to environmental conservation and climate mitigation . This approach addresses both debt distress and climate change by redirecting debt payments towards climate-smart projects . <p> Several developing countries have used debt-for-climate swaps to finance climate projects .

The proposed budget is silent on these options , leaving matters to the imagination of our federal and provincial economic managers . Instead of having a simplistic , linear approach to macroeconomic stabilisation , it 's time to set the direction for a climate-resilient country .

Pakistan currently invests only 14% of GDP , less than half what is generally considered as necessary for sustained growth , " he said . <p> Dr Syed was of the view that the debt burden are not just artefacts of the current high interest rates in Pakistan and globally . <p> " On all the above metrics , Pakistan 's interest bill has been among the highest in the world for the last four years , even when interest rates were much lower , " it added . <p> " So this problem reflects Pakistan 's heavy debt burden and not high interest rates . And it is here to stay , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's revenues were to " miraculously increase " by a large 2% of GDP over the next couple of years , interest would still eat up around 55 % of government revenues <p> " One way to solve the problem is to try to boost government revenue by increasing taxes but this will take time and can backfire , as demonstrated in Kenya recently ... <p> " Similarly , spending cuts can only go so far as the debt burden is too onerous .

But there should be a conducive atmosphere which does not have terror , hostility or violence . " <p> Much has happened since January 2023 . Pakistan 's economy has continued to decline and the country is simmering with political discontent . The February 8 election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operational levels , has only worsened the situation . The overt and covert repression might have quietened down the full expression of dissent but it continues to fester , affecting the body politic , and will likely recrudesce . <p> India has gone through an election too , which saw the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) emerge victorious , albeit without securing a clear majority on its own . After 10 years , India now has a coalition government , but the BJP remains the predominant driver of that coalition . This essentially means that while Modi , now in his third term as prime minister , might not be able to strong-arm the opposition internally as he is used to , his coalition will go along with his foreign and security policies . In other words , we are unlikely to see much change on that front . <p> The cutting edge of that wedge is India 's Pakistan policy : stall talks , hurt Pakistan diplomatically and by sponsoring terrorism at the sub-conventional level , while continuing to accuse Pakistan of " terrorism " and speak of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> No one actually disputes that talking would be better than hostile actions between Pakistan and India or that greater trade would not be beneficial to the two countries . But can such talks and greater trade take place in the context of current Pakistan-India relations ? And would they solve their ongoing bilateral issues ? Ejaz Haider uses international relations theory to challenge the common narrative ... <p> The question then is , to quote the headline from a recent op-ed by Engr Khurram Dastgir-Khan , " What to do with India ? " The question implies that Pakistan has to do something , given not just the physical fact of India 's presence in the east but also because India has continued to harm Pakistan at multiple levels . <p> Khan is a Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz ( PML-N ) heavyweight and has run commerce , defence and foreign ministries . He is not an outsider taking an outside-in view , but has been an inside player . It is instructive when he says that as a first step Pakistan should " stop offering talks to India , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than once . " He was referring to recent statements by the prime minister and the foreign minister . <p> Another former PML-N leader and twice Pakistan 's finance minister , Dr Miftah Ismail , argues that Pakistan should keep every other issue/dispute on the back-burner and trade with India . When interviewed for a Dawnarticle , Dr Ismail said , " All trade is beneficial , and given the countries ' proximity , it is beneficial to both countries . China and Taiwan have a dispute , but their trade is booming . India and China have a dispute , but their trade is flourishing . China and India have skirmishes at the border but trade with one another . " <p> Pakistan-India relations can be discussed and debated from a number of perspectives . Here , I will focus on just two : talking to India and trading with it . <p> PURITY VERSUS CONTEXT <p> Saying that X must talk to Y because talking is better than fighting is unlikely to beget much disagreement because talking is generally regarded as a better option . In its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens and life is all about context . <p> Take , for instance , the above statement : X must talk to Y means X is n't talking to Y. But unless it can be proved that X is n't talking to Y despite Y wanting to talk to X , one has to delve deeper into X 's reasons for not talking to Y. <p> The problem is a chicken and egg one . Trade requires better relations and better relations require trade , or at least for relations to reach a point where other disputes can not derail trade . Clearly , reaching that point requires a bilateral consensus . The liberals argue that all will be well when Pakistan and India resume full trade but do n't know how to get the two sides there . <p> In the event that we figure out that X is not talking to Y because Y wants to cut X loose , we have moved the problem from the purity of the desirability of talking to the context of why talks are not happening -- or what the cost for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of simple consciousness ; context is the state of self-consciousness . <p> This is a deliberately simple exercise in problematising purity . I have not used any interstate/IR theoretical framework to add to the complexity of context . The English language has an adage , " It takes two to make a row . " This is wrong because , while it often takes one to make a row , it most definitely takes two to make peace , unless one of the two actors has been completely subjugated or annihilated by the other . <p> Let me give an example used in the Realist framework but which should be obvious even in a non-theoretical sense . <p> When the Athenian generals arrived in Melos , they made a straightforward demand of Melian commissioners : submit , become a part of the Athenian empire , and your people and possessions will be spared harm . The Melian commissioners argued that " by the law of nations , they had the right to remain neutral , and no nation had the right to attack without provocation . <p> Thucydides tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " And how pray , could it turn out as good for us to serve as for you to rule ? " <p> Athenians : " Because you would have the advantage of submitting before suffering the worst , and we should gain by not destroying you . " <p> Melians : " So you would not consent to our being neutral , friends instead of enemies , but allies of neither side ? " <p> Athenians : " No ; for your hostility can not so much hurt us as your friendship will be an argument to our subjects of our weakness and your enmity of our power . " <p> When the Melians asked if that was their ' idea of equity ' , the Athenians responded : " As far as right goes ... one has as much of it as the other , and if any maintain their independence , it is because they are strong , and that if we do not molest them , it is because we are afraid ... " <p> Some might say the world has come a long way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international institutions , alliances , norms and taboos . They need only look at the Russo-Ukraine war and Israel 's savage war on Palestine . The list is long but I mention these two because they are ongoing and because memories are short . <p> Talking is preferable when the context allows for it . Or when it is between equals or even when the asymmetry is not too great . In any other case , it is about the terms of surrender , not necessarily in a military sense , but in the sense of accepting that the other party , in this case a state actor , is far too strong and it is better to accede to its diktat than be destroyed by it . <p> When Khan says it is inadvisable for the present government to offer talks to India and be shunned by it , he is not arguing against talking . He is offering a context . In that op-ed , he goes on to list what needs to be done before talks can have any meaning ; put another way , to change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ X 's need but also Y 's imperative . That is the only point where one can ascribe any meaning or meaningfulness to the talks . <p> Talking is better than fighting but many such rounds in the past have failed to pluck even low-hanging fruit . Reason : Pakistan has continued to decline on all indices and there 's nothing on the horizon to indicate that it has finally taken a turn for the better . If anything , the country has regressed on all counts in the last two years and continues to slide . <p> An Indian Border Security Force ( BSF ) soldier signals to a truck loaded with potatoes bound for Pakistan at the Wagah Border crossing on November 26 , 2008 : the paltry benefits of trade have to be weighed against the cost of dealing with an adversary AFP <p> TRADING WITH THE ENEMY <p> Let 's get to trade now and begin again with purity . Should one trade ? Will trade be beneficial ? Both questions are erroneous . Where there 's a seller and a buyer , trade will and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Similarly , trade is always beneficial , even if there 's imbalance -- what economists call a trade deficit . It 's better to get Rs 10 even if the other is getting Rs 100 because Rs 10 is better than Rs 0 . <p> Many studies have shown that the relaxation of constraints would benefit bilateral trade . As Dr Ishrat Husain noted in 2011 , " The theoretical argument is that countries in relative geographical proximity tend to trade more with each other than with more-distant countries , because of lower transport and communication costs . " <p> Makes perfect sense . I begin with this because the proponents of trading with India are quick to allege that those who insist on moving the issue from its purity to a context are somehow opposed to trading . This is false and they resort to this to avoid answering difficult questions . <p> To explain the issue , I would divide the purists and contextualists into two categories , liberals and realists , respectively . Realists argue that ' relative gains concerns ' will always determine a state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will badly impact trade between them . Liberals insist that disputes should not prevent Pakistan reaching out to India . This is , of course , not the first time for such arguments , given the ebbs and flows of Pakistan-India relations . <p> The problem is a chicken and egg one . Trade requires better relations and better relations require trade , or at least for relations to reach a point where other disputes can not derail trade . Clearly , reaching that point requires a bilateral consensus . To put it another way , the liberals argue that all will be well when Pakistan and India resume full trade but do n't know how to get the two sides there . In sum , they ' accept ' the realist position implicitly in the first instance , but argue nonetheless that once trade is given a chance , a different causality will kick into play , trumping the realist assumptions . <p> At this point , it is important to note that liberals are right about one thing : the inevitability of trade , the point I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace dividends . There is empirical data to support this , compiled by American political scientist Katherine Barbieri . Barbieri also co-authored with fellow political scientist Jack Levy an article in the Journal of Peace Research ( Vol 36 , no 4 , 1999 ) , captioned , ' Sleeping with the Enemy : The Impact of War on Trade . ' Barbieri and Levy maintain that " there are numerous historical cases of trading with the enemy during wartime , including trade in strategic goods that directly affect the ability of a state to prosecute the war . " <p> Trade will continue even when states are at war . While dyadic trade will be negatively impacted , trade through third parties and circuitously will continue . This is not to say that trade through third parties in such circumstances is preferable to dyadic trade . The point is that empirical data does not support the central tenet of the liberal theory that trade promotes peace or the realist assumption that states , because of vulnerability , will snap those ties . <p> If there 's a demand in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A will get to Y , regardless of the conditions of war and peace . This is also borne out by informal trade linkages between Pakistan and India , especially trade through third parties and even smuggling . The argument that dyadic trade is better is correct but not relevant to what I am arguing here . <p> Realists further argue that even if trade ties were not to snap because of security concerns and trade in fact increased , high interdependence will increase rather than decrease the chances of conflict . They point to the well-known fact that the European powers had very high levels of trade and high interdependence in the run-up to World War I. Going by the liberal argument , those levels of trade and interdependence should have prevented war . But war happened and mutual dependence actually increased vulnerability rather than decreasing it . <p> So , how does one explain that through the interdependence argument ? The realist correlation seems to be right but , as Canadian political scientist Dale Copeland argues in his International Security article ( Vol 20 , no 4 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the previous 30 years in the run-up to WWI ; hence , even if interdependence was a necessary condition for the war , it was not sufficient . <p> Copeland offers a different , syncretic approach and calls it a theory of trade expectations where the new causal variable is the expectations of future trade -- what 's the impact on the overall expected value of the trading option if a state decides to forgo war . " Levels of interdependence and expectations of future trade , considered simultaneously , lead to new predictions . Interdependence can foster peace , as liberals argue , but this will only be so when states expect that trade levels will be high into the foreseeable future . <p> Copeland 's argument is that " high interdependence can be either peace-inducing or war-inducing , depending on the expectations of future trade .

Off-shoring is giving way to in-sourcing , re-shoring and friend-shoring . The neoliberal trade order is giving way to geo-economics , rival trade blocs , protectionism and sanctions . <p> I use the term geo-economics in the sense it was used and coined by American conservative Edward Luttwak in a 1990 article and later expanded by former American diplomat Robert Blackwill and academic Jennifer Harris to mean " the use of economic instruments to promote and defend national interests , and to produce beneficial geopolitical results ; and the effects of other nations ' economic actions on a country 's geopolitical goals . " <p> To discuss this trend in some detail is outside the scope of this article , but it 's important to flag it . A good example of the Blackwill-Harris approach is the US decision to stymie the progress of China 's semiconductor industry and to force US allies in the chip-making value chain -- Taiwan , The Netherlands , South Korea , Japan -- to follow US sanctions against China 's chip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US individuals and companies and has used the sanctions stick against other states such as Australia and Taiwan et al . <p> All of this is being done in the service of national security . It will be an interesting exercise to apply Copeland 's trade expectation theory to the ongoing Russo-Ukraine War and further expand its application to Sino-US competition and the impact Sino-US bilateral disruptions will have on other economies . <p> This also provides me the segue to go back to Dr Ismail 's two examples : India-China and China-Taiwan trade linkages . Neither is useful for the Pakistan-India case . Consider . <p> China-Taiwan example is flawed for two reasons : Taiwan can not afford to go to war with China and the latter needs Taiwan , for instance for cutting-edge semiconductors . China considers Taiwan an unfinished issue from the civil war and lays claim on Taiwan , but it can bide its time and , meanwhile , accrue the benefits of imports from Taiwan . <p> Taiwan is also encouraged by China to invest in the mainland , though a May 2024 report from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's investments in mainland China have fallen to the lowest level in more than 20 years , dropping nearly 40 percent to $3 billion last year from a year earlier . " Meanwhile , Taiwan 's investments in the US have surged nine-fold , to $9.6 billion in 2023 . China is stepping up efforts to woo Taiwanese businesses to invest in China because the idea is to integrate Taiwanese economy into China 's . In 2023 , Taiwan 's trade surplus with mainland China and Hong Kong was USD 80.55 billion . <p> Meanwhile , Washington and Taipei signed a trade agreement last year and are now negotiating the next phase . According to US Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Kritenbrink , " Everything is motivated by ... a desire to build Taiwan 's deterrent capability and their resilience , all in support of maintaining the status quo and deterring China from being tempted to take ... action against Taiwan . " <p> ' India and China ' is a different dyad . China is already a great power -- India is aspiring to be one . Relations have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains unsettled , despite various agreements . China needs India 's market and it has a massive trade surplus with India . If it can prick India while retaining the Indian market , that 's a win-win for China . <p> After the June 2020 skirmishes in Ladakh , the Indian government slapped sanctions on Chinese apps and also sought to shrink the Indian market for certain Chinese products , but the volume has since picked up again . That works fine for China . <p> India , for its part , does n't have many options . It can either go bellicose and risk a major confrontation with China or try to manage relations at the Line of Actual Control ( LAC ) with overall relations , including in the area of trade . China can bide time and occasionally draw blood ; India does n't have the capacity to force a resolution . That creates a balance . Meanwhile , both sides have something to sell so both are prepared to buy . <p> ANOTHER PROBLEM <p> The ' two sides have something to sell , so both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What does Pakistan have to sell to India ? A 2005 State Bank of Pakistan report tells us that " Generally , Pakistan 's exports consist of more raw material than finished products ( italics added ) . " Corollary : if India wants to stop trading , it does n't lose anything . Pakistan is not offering ( and can not ) anything that India can not produce itself or get from somewhere else . <p> To make this point clear , using Dr Ismail 's reference to Taiwan , while China threatens a cross-strait invasion , it can not sanction Taiwan 's semiconductors because cutting-edge chips are vital to China 's industry and military modernisation . Corollary : if , hypothetically , Pakistan could become a world leader in something that everyone needed , including India , that would be a game changer . Nota bene : the semiconductor reference also validates the theory that trade will always happen even between adversaries . <p> The second issue generally implied in the trade-with-India argument is that it will improve Pakistan 's economy . I am not an economist but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paltry revenues , it ca n't in and of itself streamline the country 's economic woes , which have nothing to do with trading or not trading with India . Those structural problems are owed to rent-seeking , extractive elites that have fattened themselves on cash inflows when a conflict involving a great power 's interests rages in the northwest . <p> The venality of the extractive elites will not vanish simply because Pakistan begins to get another one or two billion dollars in its embarrassingly small kitty . Dr Ismail himself has often written and spoken about what those problems are . I will refer to just one op-ed by him , ' Foreign Trade Debate ' , which appeared in this newspaper . He picks up one issue , which is also central in many ways : what should be Pakistan 's foreign trade strategy : export promotion , or import substitution ? And he goes on to tell us how and why we have the worst of both worlds . <p> IN CONCLUSION <p> The discussion on dealing with India has to be contextualised . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are many others . The debate can not be had in silos . Trade is inevitable and it 's happening even as I write these lines . Its volume is low and will remain low because Pakistan has not innovated and has nothing to offer in value-addition terms . <p> The paltry benefits of trade have , therefore , to be weighed against the cost of dealing with an adversary that has a considered policy of not engaging with Pakistan while continuing to hurt it in multiple ways . <p> Talking is better than fighting but many such rounds in the past have failed to pluck even low-hanging fruit . Reason : Pakistan has continued to decline on all indices and there 's nothing on the horizon to indicate that it has finally taken a turn for the better .

@@110924236 <p> Amidst the numbing hum of activity on Karachi 's Beaumont Road , a colonial-era structure called Manijeh Mansions -- erroneously listed as " Mandeh Mansion " in various surveys of heritage buildings -- stands on its last legs , guarded by banyan trees . Distinctly European in character , the two-storeyed residential block , built in yellow Gizri sandstone , is an outsider in a lane lined with multi-storeyed office buildings . <p> A dense creeper that looks like an organic part of the building 's fabric sprawls across its facade , serving as a protective mane . The only semblance of life at this uninhabited , crumbling site is the layer of foliage that surrounds it . <p> The building 's main entrance is an ornate , wrought-iron pedestrian gate-arch , flanked by two columns holding up a balcony . Intricate mouldings of garlands -- known as " festoons " , according to the architect Yasmin Lari -- adorn the remnants of the balcony and can be found beneath every balustrade . <p> The interior 's state of disrepair is visible through the gate , which remains closed to visitors . A heap of stones , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lies in the foyer , along with a pile of twigs and other discarded items . The staircase -- similar in size and style to the one in the lobby of the not-too-faraway Bristol Hotel -- has been stripped of its decorative aspects . <p> Little is known about a distinctly European , colonial-era stone building surrounded by newer homogenous office buildings on Karachi 's Beaumont Road , except that it 's in an advanced stage of crumbling neglect . Ali Bhutto sets out to investigate and uncover its bygone days ... <p> From the shadows , a figure emerges . A labourer working inside the building walks up to the gate and leans against it with his hands -- his tired , slanting eyes looking out at the chaos of the city .

The wooden external staircase on the left leads to the upper storey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the upper storey displays a different type of masonry than the rest of the building : the stones are better chiselled and of a smoother finish , while the lower storey and sides are " rough-tooled " and therefore less costly , according to Lari . Both are , nevertheless , an example of " ashlar masonry " , she says , which means the stones were laid in courses , with great precision , by skilled artisans . <p> In many colonial-era structures -- including the Flagstaff House , now the Quaid-i-Azam House Museum -- more effort and expense went into making the front of the building look impressive , while the sides were given lesser importance , and the least amount of effort went into the rear , according to Lari . <p> The right upper portion of the facade is in a precarious state and parts of it appear to have already fallen apart -- a painful truth covered up by a pilkhan tree ( white fig , a species of the ficus genus ) . There is scaffolding along a portion of the building and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen where balustrades once stood . The director general of the Antiquities and Archaeology Department of the government of Sindh , Abdul Fatah Shaikh , confirms to Eos that the building is a listed heritage site . <p> The windows along the upper storey facade contain latticework -- or a jafri -- with a small opening at the centre and a balustrade along the bottom , while the lattice in the larger , lower-storey windows is fitted with ribbed ventilators . This specific type of jafri , made of narrow wooden planks laid in a criss-cross pattern , can be seen in colonial-era bungalows across Sindh . <p> According to Lari , it served the function of keeping out the sun and bringing in the wind , and appears more frequently in Karachi , where there is a sea breeze , than in other places , such as Lahore . <p> LIVING MEMORIES <p> The arched windows , remnants of which can be seen along the sides of the building , once contained stained glass , recalls Ronnie Patel , who spent a lot of time at Manijeh Mansions while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is he who confirms to Eos the correct name of the building and that it is not a single-family residence , but a block of four apartments , one of which was occupied by his late uncle , Rustom Kaikobar -- whom he refers to as " Rusi Mama " -- and another by Rusi Wania . <p> He remembers the tall ceilings , tasteful interiors and big parties thrown by his uncle , who was the legal counsel of the American , Japanese , Korean and Thai consulates in Karachi . <p> There used to be a wooden gate on the right corner of the compound , recalls Patel , and a garden where a black Great Dane , named Cleopatra , could be found . Remnants of the garden can be seen today in the form of pilkhan and banyan trees -- both a species of ficus -- standing tall along the side of the building , their branches looking like raised arms , protecting the site from the relentless march of concrete . <p> Back then , the North Western Hotel ( designed by the Jewish architect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tavern and Grill , and the Mavalwalla residence , all lay across the road from Manijeh Mansions , while the Parsi-run Lucas Girling Agency lay adjacent to it , according to Patel . <p> The Karachi Residents Directory for 1932 lists a Manijeh Mansions on Beaumont Road , with ' Flat A ' being occupied by a British army captain , John St John Balguy . Living with the 33-year-old captain , according to MyHeritage and Ancestry databases , was his wife , Dorothy Alice Harding , two years his senior .

It was known as a " railway hotel " , according to Hasan . <p> Also , around this time , Thomas Beaumont -- after whom the street is named -- was president of the Karachi Municipal Corporation , according to a letter written by him in 1909 to a publication , called The Builder , requesting designs , plans and estimates for a new municipal office in Karachi . <p> Manijeh Mansions ' location on the peripheries of the then-exclusive Civil Lines Quarter provides some clues as to when it might date back to . This part of Civil Lines -- essentially an extension -- was developed later , according to Lari , and was not as posh as the neighbourhoods along Victoria Road and Elphinstone Street , which came up in the second half of the nineteenth-century . <p> Locals were not allowed to own property in Civil Lines until after the First World War and , even then , only the wealthiest of them could afford to do so ( Lari , The Dual City ) .

An 1890 map , by James Strachan , places the ice factory at the very spot where the eateries currently lie on Beaumont Road . <p> According to a report by the Bombay Presidency Forest Department , the ice factory dated back to 1871 , making it highly likely that the building in Laughton 's map was also the same factory .

Fusion between the traditional Gharwi Group sounds and the contemporary vocals of Faris Shafi and Umair Butt 's dialogue invite us to lose ourselves in a shared reality . <p> ' Jhol ' Fold is also about love with pure intentions , worn as a loose fabric , for every jhol represents a promise waiting to be kept , with a soft and uncomplicated love . This song 's operatic quality lies in Annural Khalid and Maanu 's ability to weave multi-faceted layers into a poignant reflection on love -- of words unspoken and moments unshared . <p> In ' Jhol ' , the red scarf visually showcases how precious the presence of a beloved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can become richly fragrant , depicting so many loving memories . <p> ' Turri Jandi ' Keeps Passing has a non-linear narrative and is a reflection of Pakistani pop history , making it my favourite song and video -- both conceptually and in terms of execution -- of CS Season 15 . Shazia Manzoor encapsulates more than 30 years of pop memory in her career , carrying forward musical influences from an era before her . Hasan Raheem and Shazia Manzoor exist simultaneously , icons crystallising the entire story of Pakistani pop in one song . <p> In essence , ' Turri Jandi 's ' video and sound is the reality of all-things-Pakistan , having never been diluted by the interference of external elements . <p> In exploring time , ' Piya Piya Calling ' Beloved Calling is the longing for belonging felt by the diaspora . The diaspora are people scattered from their ancestral homeland , and here the land calls them back . <p> Whether it is the unrequited love sung by Kaifi Khalil , the longing for a lost love as sung by Norwegian duo Karpe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about , this song 's essence is about the profound desire to feel and belong , despite the irretrievable . <p> Each artist is unafraid of the emotional spaces they inhabit as a result of their various intergenerational experiences of loss shown in the desolate , empty video .

' As the final song of CS Season 15 , it has fleeting notions of the dialogue between the world vocalised by Nizam Torwali , and humanity sung by Zeb Bangash , with the pure , unadorned sincerity of youth represented by Noorima Rehan 's vocals . This video shows a heaven realised on earth -- humans existing in harmony and balance with nature and life . <p> To me , Coke Studio Season 15 , as a whole , speaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be found , it seems to say , by embracing the essence of life and looking inward at " the oneness of shared souls .

@@110990230 <h> Events that Shape Our Lives <p> In his ground-breaking 2008 book , The Way We 'll Be , my brother John used his decades of polling to observe and define the values and worldviews that are unique to different age groups of Americans . It was n't their biological age that was determinate ; it was the life experiences -- the defining events and traumatic moments -- they shared with their contemporaries that shaped their views , their values , and their sense of future possibilities . I 'm speaking here of events and moments that have impacted the nation , not those that have occurred in our personal lives or those that have impacted groups or communities within the nation . And while this is true for every generation in every country , I want to look at how this has played out in my life in the USA . <p> My mother 's generation , for example , was shaped by the two world wars that bracketed the Great Depression . These dramatic events left scars , to be sure , but they also altered people 's outlook and behaviour . Because that generation knew hardship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to achieve security and stability in their lives and those of their offspring . The shared sacrifices that accompanied the great wars also fueled a patriotic fervour , a belief in government as a constructive agent for change and a commitment to national service . <p> My generation lived through the Cold War and the " Red scare . " In school we had regular drills where we were required to hide under our desks to protect ourselves from nuclear attacks . This , of course , provided no protection , but it did create a powerful fear both of " the bomb " and the Communists who we were told might attack us . <p> Then came the Vietnam War and the military draft which compelled millions of young men to fight in a war that could never be won . Reaction to Vietnam and the draft spawned an anti-war movement that divided the nation and shattered the Cold War notion of " patriotism . " Simultaneous with the transformative impact of the war was the rise of the civil rights movement , which not only saw advances in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awareness of racial injustice among many in the majority-white community . And finally , my generation was rocked by the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy , his brother Robert , and Martin Luther King , and the demise of President Richard Nixon , who was forced to resign in disgrace . The trauma created by these momentous events combined , left the country in shock that ultimately challenged the dominant political and social culture that had held sway for a generation . <h> Then there is the toll taken by covid-19 . Normal life has been disrupted for the past two years . For the greater part of this period , children , at different stages of development , were denied needed interaction and social development -- not to speak of the impact it has had on their learning . And finally , there is the partisan anger , the weaponization of the hatred of " others , " and the vulgarity of the Trump era and its residual effects on our political and social culture . <p> My children came of age during a period that began with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ USA feeling that it had emerged as the victorious sole superpower . There were also problems to be sure . Partisan politics became bitter . Economic disparities grew and racial injustices continued to boil . Yet , for nearly a decade and a half , many lived with a renewed sense of promise and hope in the future . <p> This calm was shattered by the terror attacks of 9/11 and the fear and national hysteria that followed . Americans did n't just watch the attack on New York 's iconic World Trade Center . They lived and felt it personally , creating fear and feelings of vulnerability . Then came the two long wars in Afghanistan and Iraq with the steep price they exacted in lost lives , innocence , and prestige . In their effort to recreate the patriotic fervour that sustained national unity during the great wars and the Cold War , ideologues in the Bush administration sought to elevate first Al Qaeda and then Saddam Hussein and the Islamic Republic of Iran as existential threats . As the wars dragged on , however , what became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superpower . We were broken . Cynicism and division replaced patriotism . <p> Then came the great recession of 2008-2009 . In just a few months , unemployment doubled , some Americans lost their entire life 's savings , and one in five homeowners were faced with foreclosure on their mortgaged homes . During this moment of national angst , Barack Obama was elected president with a message of hope and change . He succeeded for a time in inspiring many , but was soon undercut by a divisive campaign with subtle and not-so-subtle themes of racial resentment and racially infused fear of his " otherness . " This campaign gave way to deeper and now dysfunctional partisan polarization , xenophobia , a decline in public confidence in once revered institutions , ultimately paving the way for the election of Donald Trump . <p> With this backdrop , one can not help but wonder what moments and events that will shape and/or scar the lives of our grandchildren ? Over the past week , conversations with my children gave me some answers . <p> My daughter told me that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during an " active shooter drill " he had secured the " best hiding place " -- one where he would never be found by a gunman . I had n't realized that these drills are a common feature in schools that children now accept as routine . <p> And why would n't they ? With mass shootings occurring almost daily and an average of two school shootings each month , it is felt that such measures are in order . Add to this , the deepening racial divide , and the mass movements that erupted in response to wanton police and vigilante violence . <p> And then there is the toll taken by covid-19 . Normal life has been disrupted for the past two years . For the greater part of this period , children , at different stages of development , were denied needed interaction and social development -- not to speak of the impact it has had on their learning . And finally , there is the partisan anger , the weaponization of the hatred of " others , " and the vulgarity of the Trump era @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> These era-shaping developments will have a far-reaching effect on the generation that is coming of age in the third decade of this new century . How they play out and whether , in this context , it will be possible to recreate a sense of national purpose and unity remains to be seen .

@@111107235 <p> Pakistan State Oil ( PSO ) is the largest marketing company and has the largest market share in the OMC sector . It is involved in the marketing and distribution of motor gasoline ( Mogas ) , high-speed diesel ( HSD ) , furnace oil ( FO ) , jet fuel ( JP-1 ) , kerosene , CNG , LPG , petrochemicals , and lubricants .

These investments include infrastructure development , renewable energy projects , exploration and production ventures , and technological advancements . <p> Historical financial performance <p> The downstream oil and gas sector saw massive fluctuation in demand over the last few years due to COVID-19 . Other factors steering demand for petroleum products have been the changes in the energy mix , particularly shifting away from furnace oil towards coal and LNG .

The rise in volumes along with higher prices and the RLNG business led to a 30 percent year-on-year surge in the PSO 's sales revenues and 77 percent growth in the bottomline . <p> Volumetric growth continued in FY18 in the retail segment , especially motor spirit and HSD . However , PSO 's furnace oil volumes declined by 29.6 percent year-on-year in FY18 as the energy mix shifted to RLNG and coal for the power sector . While topline was up by 20 percent , profit after tax went down by 15.2 percent year-on-year primarily on account of a one-time reversal of deferred tax assets ; falling other income , and higher exchange losses . <p> FY19 was a difficult year for the OMCs due to the economic slowdown amid rising competition . Margins also fell due to falling volumes by the sector especially the furnace oil , while the retail fuels like diesel volumes also witnessed a decline due to falling demand from both the industrial sector and the transport sector , along with falling vehicle sales . Moreover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , peaking circular debt and mounting receivables were key factors that dragged the sector 's performance , including that of PSO . And despite an overall decline of around 38 percent in volumetric sales , PSO 's revenues posted a modest increase due to a rebound in the company 's volumes in the last quarter of FY19 . Profits slipped by 32 percent , which came from higher inventory losses , lower volumes , finance costs , and exchange losses . In FY19 , PSO acquired a 52.67 percent stake in PRL , which lifted its consolidated earnings . <p> In FY20 , PSO 's volumes in furnace oil reduced further due to the continuing impact of focus on RLNG . On the other hand , in the retail sector , PSO experienced an increase in petrol volumes against an overall decline in the industry due to PSO 's increased range amid low demand . Industry diesel volumes were affected due to weak industrial activity , construction activity , and reduced road and rail movement . However , PSO managed to gain volumetric growth . <p> The decline in gross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the falling volumes on account of the sharp decrease in international oil prices during the year . However , an increase in finance costs due to a higher average policy rate adversely impacted the bottom line . The decline in gross profit and increase in finance cost was partially offset by lower exchange losses and higher interest income recovered from the power sector during the year . <p> PSO reported record earnings for FY21 with a rebound in profitability , in contrast to a loss in FY20 . PSO was able to reverse the trend of falling revenues with the FY21 topline growing by 9 percent year-on-year due to volumetric growth and price increase . A key feature for FY21 was the return of furnace oil in the fuel mix as its demand and usage increased during the year . PSO 's overall volumes increased by 24 percent year-on-year with the three key products : petrol , diesel , and furnace oil climbing by 21 , 21 , and 37 percent year-on-year . Improved fuel quality -- PSO introduced Euro 5 standard gasoline , diesel , and HOBC during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth . The company 's earnings benefited from an increase in other income that comes from growth in late payment surcharge income ; no noticeable rise in administrative and distribution costs ; and a decline in finance costs due to weaker interest rates . <p> PSO witnessed a whopping earning growth in FY22 , which stemmed from a fat topline . The volumes for PSO 's products MS , HSD , and FO grew by 15 percent , 26 percent , and 62 percent , respectively -- year-on-year . Noticeable growth in volumes also helped PSO grow its market share in all three products . <p> PSO 's gross profit growth was massive , primarily due to significant inventory gains on the back of increasing oil prices . Other income increased by 32 percent year-on-year due to higher interest received on delayed payments . PSO 's operating profits grew by over 183 percent yearly in FY22 , with support from other income and the top line and gross profit growth . PSO 's bottom-line surged by almost three times in FY22 where much of the growth came from volumetric growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products , price increases , higher other income as well as the company 's increased retail footprint and market share . <p> PSO in FY23 <p> PSO 's topline growth was visible in FY23 . Revenues were seen increasing by 38 percent year-on-year . This rise in revenues on a year-on-year basis in FY23 however , was solely due to higher selling prices of petroleum products because the volumetric sales of key petroleum products like motor spirit , diesel , and furnace oil declined by 17 percent , 25 percent , and 64 percent year-on-year , respectively . While the oil marketing companies had seen robust sales of petroleum products in most of FY22 , the petroleum sales were the weakest in the last 5 years in FY23 due to the economic downturn , political turmoil , and flash floods . <p> PSO 's gross profit also took a hit in FY23 due to inventory losses amid weaker sales . The gross margin for the OMC settled at 2.21 percent in FY23 - down by more than 400 basis points year-on-year . Despite significantly lower reversals of provisions on financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ margins fell due to weaker gross profits . <p> PSO also witnessed a decline in other income of about 46 percent year-on-year during FY23 , given the lower interest received on delayed payments . Another bulkiness on the OMC 's bottom line was the finance cost that surged by 8 times in FY23 , along with a share of loss from associates in FY23 versus profit in FY22 . The OMC reported an unconsolidated profit of Rs12 billion in FY23 versus Rs184 billion in FY22 -- a decline of 93 percent . <p> PSO 's topline growth stood at 7 percent year-on-year in 1QFY24 . The growth in PSO 's revenues is due to higher selling prices of petroleum products as well as a jump in motor gasoline and high-speed diesel volumes by 7 percent and 8 percent , year-on-year respectively , due to low base impact from last year . Meanwhile , furnace oil volumes dwindled by 87 percent year-on-year during the quarter . <p> The company 's gross profit was seen growing by 9 times , while the gross margins were up from less than one percent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gross margins was due to massive inventory gains due to substantial and continued hikes in fuel prices . <p> PSO witnessed a decline in other income of about 48 percent year-on-year during 1QFY24 , likely due to lower interest received on delayed payments . Finance costs were also seen increasing by more than double due to higher short-term borrowings . However , PSO 's bottomline was able to absorb the higher costs and post hefty earnings for the quarter , which is a complete turnaround from the previous quarter , when the company posted a loss ( 4QFY23 ) . <p> PSO in 9MFY24 and beyond <p> The OMC posted a weaker quarterly financial performance in 3QFY24 , but growth for the overall nine-month period .

@@111639230 <h> Highlighting economic issues : how media has let us down <p> The writer is an author and teaches journalism at Hamdard University , Karachi <p> Almost none of our mainstream media houses has done us proud when it comes to economic and financial reporting . From the way economic and financial issues have been covered since independence , it 's apparent that not much thinking goes into it . In fact , the entire edifice of economic reporting looks incidental in nature , rather than being deliberate and well thought-out . <p> Have our editors ever deliberated upon such vital matters as how to deal with confirmed and chronic tax evaders ? Should such violators of law be treated in the same manner as any law-abiding citizen must be ? <p> A related question is : how appropriate is it for the media to cover extensively viewpoints of the retailers and traders who mount protests or issue persuasive and provocative statements for the sole purpose of avoiding paying direct taxes ? If yes , should their pictures and videos be published and telecast as well ? Is there any wisdom in treating them on a par with , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for six months ? <p> It 's been observed that in the absence of prior instructions on the matter , most economic reporters write about the chronic tax evaders as well as their protests and demands in somewhat sympathetic terms . Thus , the editors ' carelessness -- rather thoughtlessness -- unwittingly and inadvertently turns their newspapers into " powerful well-wishers " of the untaxed sectors . And their readers , because they are never schooled in the virtues of good citizenry , never learn why we should oppose every move aimed at short-changing the nation . <p> Let 's turn now to an issue on which most media houses seem utterly confused -- the not-so-small matter of state-owned enterprises , like PIA , which turn in losses by the billions each year . Everyone knows that disposing of such organisations ( by privatising them ) makes economic as well as financial sense . Yet the media seems reluctant to advocate their prompt privatisation . What could be the problem there ? <p> Well , one major reason could be the journalists ' reluctance to have anything to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pakistan Steel Mills is massively overstaffed and that whoever will buy it will definitely lay off hundreds , if not thousands , of people in order to make it profitable . <p> However , what the media needs to understand is that people who would be laid off as a result of privatisation would likely be less proficient than those retained by the company 's new owners . In other words , merit would prevail in such a situation ; that 's precisely how it should be . <p> Secondly , people who once landed plush jobs because of their contacts with influential persons in high positions , or because of their political clout , can not be pampered all their lives , especially when doing so would ruin the national economy completely . Such opportunists may have enjoyed an easy ride thus far due to their connections , but that needs to stop simply because our debt servicing requirements ( interest payments ) now account for more than half of our total budget outlay . <p> We have often seen newspapers mount sustained campaigns in favour of human rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upholding gender equality just as others do in promoting democracy ( as opposed to military rule ) . But have we ever had an instance in which a newspaper launched a sustained drive for eradication of all tax exemptions ? I think there 's been no such instance although campaigns could have been launched on several important issues like that . <p> Another big let-down has been the journalists ' failure to explain to the public the horrors of the national economy in easy-to-understand terms . A big factor that played into that particular deficiency was all our leaders ' reluctance to call a spade a spade , particularly in the last five or so years . Had our leaders been more forthcoming in this regard , the media would just have played up their statements and the public would have gotten the message . <p> However , our leaders never got the nerve to declare in plain terms that the " national honeymoon " was over and that each member of the public would have to earn their keep now . In this regard the one ( proverbial ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common failure " to look straight into the eyes of the voter and declare : " It 's now become vital for all the sectors to pay ( direct ) income tax ; so no ( tax ) exemptions from now on . " <p> Because no national leader , including those in the uniform , had the guts to say that in public , it had become incumbent upon the news organisations to do so instead . But alas the journalists failed miserably on that score , just as they have done in several other areas as well . <p> One vital issue on which both our leaders and media houses have kept mum is the " disastrous and continued use " of imported products by the rich people of our woefully poor country . An insightful analysis posted on social media very rightly pointed out that Pakistan has had to seek bailouts from the IMF for more than 20 times simply because it has never been a productive economy . <p> The members of its elite have made money either through such unproductive activities as real estate business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means often feel the need to flaunt their wealth . And what better way to do so than to spend money generously on buying expensive products from international brands such as Nike , Apple and Mercedes . <p> However , because the country is perennially short of dollars as it exports products worth only about $30 billion each year and imports essential products of a greater value , it should be extra cautious when it comes to spending dollars on importing luxury goods . That 's why our leaders should put in place policies that make it difficult to import the products for which we do have cheaper local alternatives . Why should imported shampoos be sold openly in our Jinnah Super Markets and Saddar Bazaars when local shampoos of good quality can do just as nicely ? This is yet another area in which our media needs to educate the masses .

Soon after , the Covid-19 crisis hit , changing the way education was delivered worldwide . Universities had to rely more often on technology and remote learning , which was a big challenge for maintaining high learning standards , both in Pakistan and globally . <p> Internationally , many universities responded by merging resources , campuses and departments to become stronger . In Pakistan , however , the focus was on increasing the number of universities and their affiliated colleges , often without enough resources . This led to lower standards in curriculum and assessment to handle the growing number of students . <p> As Vice Chancellor of Government College University ( GCU ) Lahore , my alma mater , I had the chance to use my experience from leading global institutions like Oxford University and the London School of Economics . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both immediate solutions and long-term strategic planning . <p> Most Pakistani universities struggled with faculty professionalism , showing the need for ongoing professional development and better recruitment processes .

GCU , despite its prestigious status , faced similar challenges in maintaining high standards in academics and governance . <p> Moreover , the infrastructure at both the Main and New Campuses of GCU was inadequate , leading to a less-than-optimal learning environment . Classrooms and lab facilities were inadequate , and evening programmes needed reforms to match the quality of the morning programmes . Irregularities in student and faculty admissions made things more complicated , emphasising the need for fair and merit-based selection processes . <p> I committed to closing these gaps and steering GCU Lahore to higher standards .

People said that the retailers are always violating the official price list and sell all the items on higher prices . <p> They blamed that due to ineffective monitoring by commissioners , Deputy Commissioners ( DCs ) , Assistant Commissioners ( ACs ) , the special price control magistrates , and other relevant departments , the consumers were at the mercy of the vendors as they were free to charge their own prices of not only vegetables and fruits but of other items too .

It also observed retailers , vendors , and other sellers are not displaying official price list of household items at a prominent place and are not even providing on demand . <p> According to traders , over the past few years , continuous increase in fuel and utilities ' costs significantly contributed to increasing the prices .

@@111762231 <p> A member of the press pictured at the Army Public School , Peshawar on December 17 , 2014 in the aftermath of the gruesome attack : the trauma centre at the journalism school at the University of Peshawar was also established in December 2014 AFP <p> At the Wana Press Club in South Waziristan in late 2023 , a reporter spoke of the need for having a trauma centre for journalists based in what are now the " merged districts " of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa ( KP ) province . I was researching a report on the state of media in the merged districts of the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas ( Fata ) and this interview came during what was the last stop in a series of visits to Pakistan 's north-western tribal areas and districts bordering Afghanistan . The journalist said , " The government , both at the provincial and federal level , promised us a trauma centre for the tribal journalists , but nothing came of it . " <p> It took me back to 2014 . That year , the journalism school at the University of Peshawar ( UoP ) had established one such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development and training centre of the German state broadcaster Deutsche Welle . At the time , the erstwhile Fata areas were still that -- a semi-autonomous buffer zone on the border with Afghanistan , governed by the centre and its representatives . <p> The discriminatory Frontier Crimes Regulations , a legacy of the British era under which the tribal areas were ruled long after Pakistan 's independence , did not allow freedom of speech and assembly , and enforced collective punishment for individual actions . There were no courts or police , no local media and political rights . For more than 70 years of Pakistan 's independence , the people of the region lived without fundamental human rights while citizens in the rest of Pakistan had access to them under the Constitution . The merger of former-Fata areas with KP in 2018 promised to change that . <p> The trauma centre at the journalism school was built in December 2014 , the year and the month that saw the massacre of children at the Army Public School ( APS ) in Peshawar , a devastating culmination to 14 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Terror ' -- that befell the region post 9/11 . The APS attack , claimed by the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ) , was in retaliation to the military operation , Zarb-e-Azb , against the TTP militants active in North Waziristan . The operation , launched in June that year , displaced close to a million people from the tribal agency , including journalists . <p> Six years earlier , in 2009 , another military operation , Rah-e-Rast , against militants in Swat had displaced 2.2 million in the month of May . At the height of militancy in Swat between 2004 to 2009 , detentions , displacement and killing of journalists had been common , as was the debilitating psychological trauma of covering a protracted conflict with widespread death and destruction . <p> The merger of the former tribal agencies into Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2018 was meant to usher in a new era of protection and constitutional rights for its citizens after being deprived of them for more than 70 years . But it seems not much has changed for the people of newly merged districts . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught between pressures from all sides , is the most severe ... <p> To the trauma centre at UoP came journalists suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , both those local to the KP province and others from the neighbouring Fata . A story in Dawn , covering the trauma centre , said this was a region where journalism had become immersed " in the extreme violence and daily threats " of a relentless conflict . <p> When the trauma centre was launched that December , News Lens , an online news cooperative with which I served as an editor for KP and Balochistan -- a province with its own history of a simmering conflict , and where , too , journalists were , are , frequently targeted -- did a story to cover its inauguration . In the story , a Peshawar-based journalist , Muhammad Irshad , said that he had " not been able to sleep properly lately . " Irshad said he had been " suffering abnormal sleep patterns due to covering violent incidents day after day . " <p> A RECURRING NIGHTMARE <p> Nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the much-hyped merger of former Fata with the rest of KP in 2018 -- I turned to a journalist at the Wana Press Club that day and asked a question I knew the answer to only too well , if only because he was not the first person I had spoken to : " Why do you think the journalists in the merged areas need a trauma centre ? " <p> Having had numerous conversations about how the conditions had changed for the media in the wake of the merger , I had little doubt about the legitimacy of the demand for a trauma centre for journalists in the merged areas . By late 2023 , the region 's slide back into terrorism was well on its way . It was the year when , according to the East Asia Forum write-up titled ' Explaining the Resurgence of Terrorist Violence in Pakistan ' , the country relived " the scary spectre of 2013 " -- when terrorist attacks " peaked at nearly four attacks a day , with nearly 2,700 total fatalities . " With a growing incidence of terror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " mainstream " them , the spectre of Talibanisation is haunting the region again . <p> Once again , the border regions of KP are in the news for all the wrong reasons -- not that they ever emerged into a peaceful , hopeful place after 9/11 . And nowhere is that sense more palpable than in the merged districts , with localised military operations , suicide bombings , targeted killings , extortion by threats and violence , attacks on military and police installations . And the consequent tightening of security and restrictions on civil liberties happening all over again , amidst increasing militarisation of the region . <p> With journalists at the forefront of living and reporting on the volatile situation , it is the state of the media and journalism in the region that illustrates the immensity of that threat like nothing else . But instead of active and sustained support from media organisations and the authorities , given the situation on the ground , now , as then , local journalists walk the tightrope of a hazardous profession . It is a witches ' brew of hostilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of peace and opportunity , the pro- and anti-state militants active in the region , state institutions , the authorities governing the region and , most of all , journalists ' parent organisations in mainstream media . <p> Once again , the border regions of KP are in the news for all the wrong reasons . Nowhere is that sense more palpable than in the merged districts , with localised military operations , suicide bombings , targeted killings , extortion , attacks on military and police installations . With journalists at the forefront of living and reporting on the volatile situation , it is the state of the media and journalism in the region that illustrates the immensity of that threat like nothing else . <p> Tribal journalists insist this " lack of support " from their employer media organisations -- a grievance that surfaced in every single interview with journalists -- in the face of rampant odds and threats , has directly contributed to their vulnerability in the field , exposing them to harm . <p> Even though not " hostile " to their workers in the real sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety of their workers has placed them on the side of " harm " . Just as the race for breaking news and a focus on conflict jeopardised the life and limbs of journalists in the ' War on Terror ' years , they once again threaten the well-being of journalists during the renewed spike in terrorism-triggered insecurity . And it 's not just the journalists that are at risk , but the very cause of journalism and public interest is imperiled in the region . <p> Not much has been learnt from the blood-soaked decades of the ' War on Terror ' , whose history is often written in the blood of journalists who died in the line of duty . That war may have morphed in its global context but , for the people -- including the journalists in the region -- it continues like a recurring nightmare , coming back to haunt the region and its people . <p> According to the journalist asking for a trauma centre , " Ours is a region amidst another cycle of the ' War on Terror . ' Bomb blasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> And then he added something that echoes the predicament of journalists in the region not long ago . He pulled out a strip of sleeping pills from his pocket and , like that journalist in the 2014 News Lens story about the inauguration of the trauma centre at the journalism school , he said , " Sleep has abandoned us . " <p> Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ) militants pictured in South Waziristan in 2012 : the spectre of Talibanisation is haunting the region once again AP <p> LEFT TO THEIR OWN DEVICES <p> In 2006 , when he came to receive us at the Mir Ali market in North Waziristan on a hot summer afternoon , Hayatullah Khan , the journalist from North Waziristan who was slain later that same year , looked more like a gun-toting militant than the friendly tribal journalist I knew . <p> Both Hayatullah and his brother had around their shoulders that great mower of men in these parts , the AK-47 . " Why the gun , Hayatullah ? " , I asked him , amazed that he was armed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to journalists , " he said , adjusting the white cap he always wore on his head . " We are left to our own devices to protect ourselves . " <p> It was July , an uneasy time , when the memory of several journalists killed in neighbouring South Waziristan was fresh . Usually not the safest of professions anywhere in Pakistan , journalism had turned deadly for reporters who stayed the course in the tribal areas . Others had simply packed up and left for towns in the " settled areas " where they could report on developments in the troubled region from a safe distance . <p> " Let 's go home , " Hayatullah said , grabbing me by the elbow , pulling us in a hurry out of the little ice cream shop near the bus terminal . It was as if he was fearful of being in a public spot . Quickly , we got into his old but sturdy pick-up truck . His brother got in the back , gun on the ready , vigilantly scanning the landscape , as if expecting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plains and villages we were moving through . <p> As we drove through the market of Mir Ali -- one of the three subdivisions of North Waziristan , then , as now , a tense setting for targeted killings , terrorist attacks and military operations -- a signboard announced that carrying firearms was prohibited in public places . I asked Hayatullah if his brother went everywhere with him to watch over him . " He has to , I ca n't drive and use a gun at the same time , should something go wrong , " he answered . <p> I asked , " But that means staying with you all the time . Does n't he study or work ? " " He does , " Hayatullah explained matter-of-factly , " but someone has to take care of us . If it is not me , it has to be him . That 's the way it is . " <p> Now in late 2023 , I was pulled out of a roadside tea-stall in Tank , even before I had time to bite into a piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by way of a threat , that I could n't ? Later , I observed and learnt that the government had provided armed police guards to journalists for security . As we drove from Tank to Wana to meet journalists at the press club there , the journalist who took me there had an AK47 placed by the driver 's seat . <p> " The conditions are far from safe here . To be a journalist here is nerve-racking , " he said when I asked the question I had of Hayatullah Khan years ago -- why carry a gun ? " In March this year 2023 , there was an alleged drone attack in the south , and a militant commander there called me to say that two children of his family were killed in the attack . He wanted me to carry the story on my channel . I could n't . Nobody in the mainstream media is willing to carry news from the militants . When I refused , he threatened me , saying we , the journalists , were paid minions of the state . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , but common to the entire journalism community in the tribal regions -- is also borne out by a written statement issued by the TTP in August 2023 . <p> It warned journalists in the Khyber and Waziristan districts to desist from being " lackeys " of the police and the military . It said militants killed in the conflict should be honoured with the title shaheed martyrs . In September , warned the letter , the TTP would be targeting journalists in the two districts . <p> While there were no attacks on journalists , and some journalists say the announcement was fake -- not issued by the TTP -- it caused alarm and panic among journalists of the merged districts . Come 2024 , and already seven reporters have been killed in the country , including Khalil Jibran in the Khyber district and Kamran Dawar in North Waziristan . <p> GUNS AND ANTI-ANXIETY PILLS <p> Over the years , a continuation of the precarious conditions in which tribal journalists live and work raises the uncomfortable question : if 2006 was when the government wanted journalists to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when journalists were losing sleep for want of peace , what has changed for the media and journalists in the tribal regions in 2024 ? <p> Five years after the former-Fata was merged into the rest of Pakistan , with legal and constitutional guarantees spelled out under the 25th Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan , it seems not much has . <p> " It is up to us to care for our safety and well-being , " said the journalist , as we left the plains of Tank , the district neighbouring South Waziristan , and entered a mountainous terrain on our way to Wana . " We work in a region where always one or the other party to the conflict is unhappy with us . We tread with care , but we also have to take measures to protect ourselves . " <p> It was when I asked him how the conditions around him affected his psychological well-being that I learnt it was n't just the " gun " he kept for safety , but he also took " pills " to sleep . " You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " It 's a state of constant mental torture and anxiety . Once I took Lexotanil . Now I am on Citanew both anti-anxiety , anti-depression drugs and Rizek for anxiety-related gastro-intestinal reflux . " <p> Guns and addictive anxiety pills -- one could be forgiven for having an unsettling deja vu . The troubles that journalists and journalism -- indeed the hapless , long-suffering people living in the tribal region -- have historically faced in the region are far from over . And with it , a lingering question mark hangs over prospects for peace and progress , and participatory , transparent development , as promised under the merger . <p> As a journalist in Bajaur put it : " Asleep or awake , ours is an anxious existence . " <p> A Pakistani journalist comforts a colleague after the death of a local journalist at the site of a suicide bomb attack on the outskirts of Peshawar on January 19 , 2016 : for a long time now , journalists have been at the forefront of living and reporting about the volatile situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no surprise that the Miranshah Press Club ( MPC ) looks haunted by its own emptiness . Most journalists from North Waziristan district have been displaced , left fearing for their lives , while others feel safer working from home . The gate is opened not by a journalist but a police guard . <p> Like with most press clubs , it is common for protestors to hold dharnas sit-ins in front of the press club in Miranshah , the district headquarters of North Waziristan . Other sit-ins happen on the roadside between Mir Ali and Miranshah -- tribesmen gathering to protest a lack of services , the military 's takeover of a school or madrassah and , more frequently now , to demand peace or the dead bodies of kin killed in security operations . They expect local journalists to take their voice to the media . <p> In 2023 , when a Pashtun Tahafuz Movement ( PTM ) sit-in in front of the MPC demanded that its arrested activists be released , one of the journalists got a call from the administration that the press club was " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowing them to use the press club toilets . " <p> According to the journalist , " I said if the administration does not want the dharna , it could always stop protesters at Sidgai the main security check post at the entrance to the district but , once people turn up at the press club , it becomes the media 's responsibility to listen to their grievances . " He says the authorities accused him of working against the state . <p> Within the decades of violence that have crippled life in the region , it is not hard to know where to place North Waziristan . It has always been coded " red " , as the alert signs remind one at the heavily guarded entry gates and military establishments . The region today continues to seeth with danger and discontent . <p> Even though one does get to see in mainstream media frequent news about soldiers and militants dying in security operations , a visit to the district reveals that people 's protests against the government and the district administration are just as common . Alternatively , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platforms , in independent posts from the community , which makes citizen journalism a risky undertaking -- as the death of Dawar in North Waziristan in May 2024 illustrates . <p> The rise of the PTM coincided with the merger of the former-Fata in 2018 , when the social movement , with leadership from former-Fata , took to the streets to protest the state 's violation of human rights in the border regions . <p> The government 's stiff response , and its no-holds-barred policy , of arresting PTM activists and denying it mainstream media coverage is well-established . What is less debated is that , at a time when the media and freedom of expression in the region should have transformed for the better -- after the much-hyped constitutional merger , allowing equal rights to the tribal people in the wake of seven decades of a constitutional limbo -- it has instead slid back into alarming chaos . <p> WALKING a RAZOR 'S EDGE <p> Five years on , the policy of snuffing dissent and controlling information , amidst a renewed wave of terror attacks , bombings and targeted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- continues to shape the conditions undermining media freedoms in the merged tribal areas of erstwhile Fata . <p> Journalists are caught precariously between the forces out to quash freedom of expression and their duty to uphold it . In a region where journalists themselves are tribesmen , they also run the risk of being labelled " a traitor to the tribal cause " if they do not give voice to tribal dissent in the face of decades of militancy and attendant militarisation . <p> The region has been , and remains today , a dangerous and volatile zone , where journalists walk the razor 's edge , a plight brought home by the fact that a record seven journalists have already been killed in the country in the first six months of 2024 . The deaths of journalists such as Dawar and Khalil suggest an alarming spike in the trend , and many others fear a similar fate as they continue to work under conditions of threats and harassment . Consider the recent case of Gohar Wazir , the displaced tribal journalist who used to report from Bannu , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kidnapped in April 2023 and physically tortured , Wazir now lives in fear and anonymity , with no job and little support from his media organisation . He was released after promising his abductors that he would not criticise the authorities . No one knows of his whereabouts , as he lives in hiding , away from his children and family , facing threats and fearing attacks on his life . <p> This was n't the first time he was targeted for his work .

" We would fetch water from running streams and wells , which have since dried up , " he tells Eos . <p> Rising temperatures , forest fires and unpredictable weather events have reduced the once verdant Shamshaki valley in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa 's Karak district to a shadow of its past , with villagers migrating out in large numbers ... <p> A community organisation even tried installing a tubewell , going down to 500 feet , but water was not available , adds Sohail . <p> CHANGING LANDSCAPES <p> Shamshaki was once a lush green valley , surrounded by wild olive jungles , orchards of peach , plums , apple and citrus . Now , only a handful can be found . Two decades ago , nobody could have imagined that the lush green fields -- where once wheat , barley , maize and watermelons grew -- would turn barren . <p> It also resulted in an exodus , with only 500 or so villagers now left in Shamshaki , with the majority of its 3,000 inhabitants forced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or sub-districts , of Karak being rich in minerals . The rugged barren hillocks and mounds of tehsils Banda Dawood Shah and Karak are rich in oil , gas , gypsum and salt .

Some of them blame the excavation of oil and gas and other minerals for the weather in their area soaring to unbearable degrees . Others blame the increased installation and use of solar panels . One recurring reason that villagers cite is the excessive deforestation , which has considerably changed the average temperature and rainfall ratio . <p> While the story seems to repeat in every second village in the region , the situation is dire in Karak district which , unlike the rest of the southern districts in KP , does not border any river or water reservoir . <p> Karak town does n't have a water supply , and its roughly 55,000 inhabitants are dependent on water tankers to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is available has been declared unfit for drinking , because of the presence of multiple salt minerals , according to Dr Muhammad Nafees , an environmentalist at the University of Peshawar <p> Syed Kaleem , an expert with the provincial environment protection agency , tells Eos that the materials used in digging and oil extraction have a direct impact on the environment and the processes cause air pollution which , in turn , causes a depletion of the ozone layer , and the resultant rise in temperature . <p> There are at least four oil and gas exploration sites in Karak , with more in the adjacent districts of Kohat , Hangu and Mianwali , that have made the air quality worse , although there is limited data to quantify the change . <p> According to a 2012 study by Dr Samreen Baber , a doctoral researcher , the round-the-clock use of gas furnaces increases the local temperature , with the data suggesting that KP witnessed between 0.3 degree Celsius to 1.2 degree Celsius rise in temperatures in the 30 years till 2010 . <p> Worsening the problem is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office of the Pakistan Meteorological Department ( PMD ) in Peshawar showing extremely unpredictable weather patterns over the last two decades . <p> COMPOUNDING CRISES <p> The change in temperature has resulted in multiple challenges for the locals , who have seen their crop yields go down drastically , while others have started to migrate . <p> " Until a few years ago , we would grow wheat , which would meet our requirements for the whole year , " says Kamran , a schoolteacher in Shamshaki village . " Now , we are lucky to get even a quarter of that , " he tells Eos . It has also impacted cattle breeding ; the low precipitation and brutal deforestation has resulted in green pastures turning barren , continues Kamran . <p> At the same time , there has been an increase in skin-related complications , including a high incidence of cancer cases , including in areas around the uranium extraction plant in Tehsil Takht-i-Nasrati , according to local doctors . <p> Dr Kashif Kamal is a skin specialist from Karak who currently works at the Lady Reading Hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he also runs a small clinic .

A member from every clan was part of the committee and , if anybody was found guilty of stealing timber , he was punished , charged financially and handed over to the police . " But with the rise of the mafia and the migration of the locals , the committee is no longer functional .

@@111762235 <p> Aziz Jindani -- call him the creative director , executive producer or the heart and soul of The Donkey King -- does n't like calling animation production in Pakistan ' an industry ' ; he 'd rather call it a ' tribe ' -- one whose best days are still out there , in a hopeful future . <p> Aziz 's film has been one of the few animated movies Pakistan has produced . In fact , one can count the titles on their fingers : there are three 3 Bahadurs , two Allahyars , a Donkey King , Tick Tock , and now The Glassworker . Each title is novel and ground-breaking to a degree ( and yes , one can count the abysmally animated Tick Tock as far as premises go ) . <p> The 3 Bahadur films showed how far one could stretch the rupee in production , and integrate product placements that could help turn a profit . Allahyar : The Legend of Markhor holds the distinction of being the world 's first animated film that is made entirely in Unreal Engine -- a videogame engine that is currently all the rage in Hollywood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of frames ) for animation and visual effects . The Donkey King proved that cute animals and witty socio-political commentary can lead to box-office gold . <p> The Glassworker , out now in cinemas -- and apparently doing pretty good business-wise -- defied conventions by being Pakistan 's first traditionally animated film , a practice that is considered too labour-intensive and unfeasible by Hollywood standards ( that 's the way big-budget studios perceive hand-drawn animation since the Disney/Pixar CG-boom ) . <p> Animation is one of the most lucrative businesses in entertainment media worldwide . But in Pakistan , despite the periodic release of homemade feature films , its landscape is bleak and most animation studios have been forced to work as contractors for international clients . Is there any hope for the future ? <p> Looking past the seemingly sun-lit aspirational success stories , one realises that things are far from hunky-dory when it comes to the business of animation . <p> There is a reason Aziz calls the business a tribe . " There are only a handful of animators in Pakistan -- animators who know what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during a late-night phone call . <p> " There is a difference between character animation , ' dabba ghumao ' animation flipping animated boxes in advertisements , and visual effects . " Pakistan has only a few professional animators , he clarifies , and their schedules are often taken up by producers such as Uzair Zaheer Khan ( the producer and director of the Allahyar films ) , whose company , 3rd World Studios , works primarily on animated films and series . Since there is a waiting line , delivering quality work that stands up to global ' A-tier ' productions is neither feasible nor practical . <p> Uzair explains that the problem partly stems from inadequate education . " People have always learned on the job , " he says , citing Post Amazers and SharpImage 's contribution in developing raw talent when the animation business became the new ' in ' thing during the early 2000s . <p> There are programmes that want to churn out new 3D animators in three months ' time . That time , he states , is n't even enough to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes at least a year of dedicated training -- and even then it takes ages to be good at it . <p> " Universities and institutions would always provide rudimentary , at times superficial or even wrong education , " he says , pointing out that most graduates ' skill-sets -- and their lack of interest in learning -- limited them from becoming anything but software operators . <p> The Donkey King <p> Kamran , who has taught in most universities ' education programmes and is a part of new education initiatives , could n't agree more . He says that there are programmes that want to churn out new 3D animators in three months ' time . That time , he states , is n't even enough to learn the programme . In comparison , an international animation-specific course takes at least a year of dedicated training -- and even then it takes ages to be good at it . <p> Kamran explains that 2017-18 's IT boom stole many aspiring animators from the business . " I just fail to understand how an IT company makes this much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew little about IT , were offered three times as much salary -- how could an animation studio that has to deliver a project with highly constricted budgets match what was being offered , he exclaims . <p> My Daddy My Superhero <p> " The human resource stopped , and those who were genuinely interested in the art of animation left Pakistan for greener pastures , " he says . Some talent he recently interviewed said that they would be happy working for nothing on weekends , but that is simply not feasible when it comes to production timelines . <p> Kamran used to head Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy 's now-closed Vaadi Animation , and now provides animation services for most Pakistani and international studios . His current projects includes the Dubai-based Barajoun Studios ' series Ajwan , which was broadcast on MBC Shahid , Knorr 's web-series D-Land by Uzair 's 3rd World Studios , Team Muhafiz with ISPR and a lot of advertisement work . <p> He says that he is n't too hopeful when it comes to Pakistani animated films . " There is n't a market , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original productions to providing services for international studios . " <p> Services that , one should clarify , are often sublet down the line by semi-major studios . Providing services on sublet does not guarantee credits , but it helps run the shop . <p> Aziz 's Talisman Studios , where he currently functions as a non-interfering executive director , has two specific wings : one for Pakistan 's feature-length projects and one that provides animation services for international clients . <p> Post-Donkey King -- which has so far earned over 24 crore rupees in Pakistan , and around $300,000 worldwide ( the film was released in South Korea , Spain , Greece , Turkey , China , Ukraine , Russia , Kazakhstan , Ecuador , Peru and Columbia ) -- Aziz says that , while the original intention was to create a studio that produces original films , he was left with no choice but to venture into the services industry . <p> Uzair 's 3rd World Studios and even Usman Riaz 's Mano Studios -- which made The Glassworker -- are providing services for international clients , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aziz , once considered one of the mavericks of the advertisement business ( he was responsible for the co-creation of Commander Safeguard ) , estimates that Pakistani brands spend about three billion rupees annually for production of advertisements . In comparison , character animation work is somewhere around seven crore rupees . " Local studios can not sustain themselves if the demand is nearly non-existent , " he says . <p> Working for international clients may sound lucrative , but Pakistan hardly qualifies to top-tier work , Aziz explains . " Pakistan may be cost-effective , but the quality we provide is only suitable for tier-two or tier-three productions . " The lack of refinement , Icon is told , comes from a lack of experience on the talent 's part . <p> " Experienced animators are hired on salaries of around 300,000 rupees per month . So , on a gross-level , an animator is expected to deliver between five and ten seconds of work every day , otherwise the hiring would not be justified , " he says . " By this standard , if someone judges our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three to five on a scale of 10 . It 's as much a capability issue as it is an issue of circumstances . " <p> Uzair affirms Aziz 's point-of-view , and adds a cricket analogy to the thought . " An aspiring cricketer first plays in a gali street , then local clubs , and then graduates to national and international levels . In Pakistan , the limited talent we have are playing in galis , and one can not expect them to deliver quality that 's beyond their present skillset . " <p> Continuing that train of thought , Uzair adds that animation is a global business that accommodates different levels of quality , and so services become an important part of an animation studio -- especially if the film one made for one 's own studio does n't return the investment . " However , " he adds , " making one 's own film does help get international jobs . If someone comes to me to make a film , they would have made a judgement based on the quality of what I 've already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one unifying answer when I asked about possible solutions that could help reinvigorate the industry : the government . <p> " Government support and infrastructure is essential , " Uzair declares . " Animation as a medium could serve as one of the most lucrative exports of Pakistan , " he continues . " Live-action films are only watched by desis -- and we all know how they 're received internationally -- but one can dub the animation and that frees it from the label of Pakistan , " he says . <p> " The stories they offer are also universal , " he adds . " If you want to indoctrinate children , there is no better medium . Children are influenced subconsciously by animation . My son is inspired by Ben 10 , as I was inspired by cartoons in my youth . Through animation , one has the means to deliver education to the children everywhere through the internet -- one does n't even need television , " he says . <p> " Animation can overcome language barriers , because a majority of children in Pakistan do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be dubbed to accommodate more languages . And let 's not forget , mass-producing content would get more people attracted to the medium , " he continues . <p> Aziz , who is currently the edible oil brand Dalda 's CEO , finds a parallel between his two businesses . <p> " They 're both process industries , " he says . " Like the edible oil business , which goes through its stages of processing and refinement , an animated film goes through voice-overs , followed by storyboard , modelling , rigging , animation , lighting and rendering -- there is an intricate pipeline , " he says . " And like all pipelines , the work needs labour . Labour that could only be supported if there is a continuity of production , and continuity of production can only be achieved through indigenous production . So , making indigenous content on scale is the way , even if done on the shoulders of bad animation . <p> " India has achieved that , " he continues . " Despite atrocious quality , the wholesale production of local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time passes -- and only government facilitation can make that happen , " he says . " Until then , one can only make films on personal risk . " <p> Aziz 's sequel to The Donkey King is a few years away , he says . However , his new film , My Daddy My Hero , is now slowly ramping up its production . The film , which stars the voice of Fahad Mustafa , is made by a " lean staff " of 12 -- an eight-person team in Pakistan , and a few international specialists ( he has had enough of local modellers and riggers , he says ) . The Donkey King also had a staff of 12 as well , he says -- a good production can only afford so much . <p> Although My Daddy My Hero is announced to be released sometime in 2025 , they 're working at their own pace and deadlines , he says . Since the project is self-funded by Mir Ibrahim -- the film 's executive producer with Aziz -- there are no timelines . <p> Uzair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allahyar and the 100 Flowers of God for its international release , before eventually starting a new film , while Kamran is looking for potential partners to produce one of his three scripts that are ready for production . <p> Despite the bleak , disheartening reality of the business currently in Pakistan , animation is still , by far , one of the most lucrative of businesses in entertainment media . All it needs is the right support to come alive . <p> While Pakistan 's Constitution was formulated with the intention of shaping a collective identity by mediating between varied ethnic groups , it now faces existential challenges as some judges seek revolutionary roles . 
@@111762236 <p> A great proponent of this thigh-skimming look is Gladiator II star Paul Mescal , who caused a media frenzy as the king of short-shorts in a tiny , Gucci striped cotton pair for the brand 's menswear show during June 's Milan Fashion Week . <p> This recent fanfare is far removed from the advice of fashion designer Hardy Amies who wrote in his 1964 work , The ABC of Men 's Fashion , that men should only be seen in shorts on the beach or a walking tour . In fact , up until the 1950s in the US , the wearing of shorts by men was banned entirely in some states , due to concerns over common decency . <p> So how did the short go from indecent and functional to short and sexy ? <p> The conversation around the rising hemlines of men 's shorts <p> Historical accounts tend to trace the origin of shorts to the 18th-century schoolboy . These shorts were usually baggy and gathered at the knee , similar to the style of breeches , which were the height of fashion during the Regency period for both young boys and gentlemen of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breeches allowed boys the freedom to run and climb . <p> Breeches evolved into a very similar style called knickerbockers , defined as loose fitting trousers to the knee or just below . Knickerbockers became popular in the 19th century and were eventually adopted by women . <p> Back at school in Britain , however , boys were seeking more freedom in their clothing and they started to favour shorter shorts than the knickerbocker . Apparently , because they were much easier for going to the loo . <p> While shorts were getting ... shorter , they were still relegated to boyhood and , for men , sporting or casual events , until the first and second world wars . <p> In 1914 , the British Army were stationed in Bermuda and found themselves in much more tropical conditions than they were used to . Lucky for them , Nathaniel Coxon -- the owner of a local tea room -- had invented a formal short that ended just above the knee to keep his staff cool . So was born the Bermuda short . <p> The late great British prime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the island in 1916 , that shorts were a bad fashion choice , except if they came from Bermuda . <p> Bermuda shorts became fashionable in the US during the 1920s and 1930s , as they were associated with travel and leisure and so were a symbol of wealth . Bermuda shorts were first mentioned in American Vogue in 1948 and , by the 1950s , had become a staple item in American suburbia . <p> Bermuda shorts , while perhaps a more conservative approach than short-shorts , are still a key style in contemporary menswear . This year they are a dominant trend in womenswear , with Vogue declaring Summer 2024 as the summer of the nu-metal Bermuda short -- baggy tailored shorts that fall just below the knee and have a ' 90s grunge feel . <p> However when it comes to really upper-thigh-skimming hems , it was during the 1970s and 1980s that men started to wear very short and tight shorts , influenced by a growth of casual wear in men 's fashion and the fitness craze of the 1980s .

Style guides are awash with features on how best to wear short-shorts , including the Mescal look , with button-down shirt and loafers . <p> Has the rise of hemlines created an objectification of the male thigh , and -- as The New York Times recently questioned -- how short should shorts really be ? Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Snobeity , is one of the world 's eternal questions . How short or long shorts should be depends on two important factors -- height and how confident a man feels . <p> Thigh-baring does take confidence , and certain people calling them " slutty " has been associated with a celebration of " himbos , hotness and health kicks " -- again in the words of GQ 's style editor . Feeling sexy in what you wear should be a component of men 's fashion as much as it is of women 's . <p> Such positivity and redefining of masculinity with fashion began in the ' 90s with Calvin Klein 's hugely successful men 's underwear range and advertising campaigns . Academic Shaun Cole noted how the move of menswear from functionality to fashionable and sexy , as epitomised by Klein , coincided with a cultural change in the representation of male bodies . <p> So why not be a bit daring and make like Mescal and beat the heat in some short-shorts because , this summer at least , they are king . <p> The writer is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trent University in the UK <p> While Pakistan 's Constitution was formulated with the intention of shaping a collective identity by mediating between varied ethnic groups , it now faces existential challenges as some judges seek revolutionary roles .

@@111882240 <p> Naeem Ahmed , a young farmer from Jaffarabad , Balochistan , never imagined the tables would turn so dramatically . Once mocked by his neighbour for using organic fertiliser , Ahmed now finds himself sought after for his farming methods . <p> At just 21 years of age , he 's part of an inspiring movement of nearly 300 farmers embracing organic farming after the devastating 2022 floods hit the mineral-rich Balochistan province . <p> Official figures paint a stark picture : out of Balochistan 's 34.7 million hectares , a mere 2.06 million ( 5.9 per cent ) are cultivated , with 54pc lying fallow due to chronic water scarcity . <p> In a province where 90pc of the population depends on agriculture and livestock , the lack of industrial activity compounds the struggle . Despite these odds , Ahmed has completed three successful rounds of crop cultivation , which have gradually lifted him out of debt , helping him achieve financial stability . <p> It was during his third round of rice cultivation that Ahmed 's neighbour , who had always ridiculed the former for his use of organic fertiliser , finally took notice . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use the chemical one because it 's tried and tested , " Ahmed recalled . Undeterred , Ahmed 's reply was simple : " Let me do my job , and you do yours . " <h> Turning the tide <p> As the seasons changed , so did the fortunes of Ahmed 's farm . In the sun-baked fields of Jaffarabad , he watched his crops flourish under the care of organic fertilisers -- a method criticised by many . The lush , healthy crops grown with organic methods stood in stark contrast to his neighbour 's chemically treated fields . The same neighbour , once doubtful , began to see the tangible benefits of Ahmed 's approach . <p> Ahmed 's neighbour was burdened by a crushing debt of Rs150,000 , largely incurred from purchasing diammonium phosphate ( DAP ) and urea fertilisers from Sindh . He bought a bag of DAP for Rs18,000 and urea for Rs8,000 . Ahmed , on the other hand , spent only Rs12,000 on organic fertiliser . <p> Gohram Baloch of the Institute of Development Studies and Practice delivers a training session for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ahmed made a profit of Rs95,000 from his crops , his neighbour was drowning in expenses due to the exorbitant cost of chemical fertilisers . The difference in the revenue was startling , but it was more than just economics that changed the latter 's mind . <p> The tipping point came when the neighbour , already exasperated by relentless costs , was faced with the looming threat of counterfeit chemical fertilisers that could ruin his six months of hard work . Ready to leave behind the uncertainty of chemicals , he wished to practice organic farming for its promise of sustainability . <h> The organic boom <p> The initiative was the brainchild of Gohram Baloch , an IDSP graduate , inspired and encouraged by Dr Quratulain Bakhteari , the founder director of IDSP . Their vision was simple yet profound -- use local seeds , organic fertilisers , and create community seed banks for future use . <p> Initially , farmers from five districts -- Jaffarabad , Sibi , Naseerabad , Kachhi ( formerly Bolan ) , and Sohbatpur -- were selected to participate . Each owned no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the IDSP policy to use local seeds and not chemical fertilisers . The support of Rs38,000 per farmer facilitated the acquisition of seeds and tractor use , with the expectation that they would return the seeds after the harvest . <p> In February 2023 , the Rotary Club Karachi , impressed by the progress , pledged support for 200 farmers by providing seeds for sunflowers and millet . <p> A phase-wise progression shows that the initiative which began with 25 farmers , has now blossomed to include around 300 . <p> IDSP initially purchased organic fertilisers from the market , but to ensure sustainability , they established two production plants in Sohbatpur and Sibi . These plants produce manure , micronutrient , and bio-stimulant fertilisers . As a result , 1,398 acres of land across the five districts were cultivated , yielding 13,356 bags of crops , each weighing 100 kilograms , Gohram Baloch informed . <p> Pakistan 's soils , burdened with deficiencies and low nutrient levels , are crying out for revival . " The characteristics of soils in Pakistan showed low to medium quality , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> With organic matter at only 1.25pc , a pH of 8.1 , and critical nutrients in short supply ( nitrogen at 0.078pc , phosphorus at 0.108pc , and potassium at 0.28pc ) , the path to improvement is clear -- embrace an organic bio-fertiliser composition that includes up to 25.2pc organic matter , a pH of 7.56 , and enhanced nutrient levels ( nitrogen at 1.99pc , phosphorus at 3.02pc , and potassium at 1.26pc ) . <p> These organic minerals , rich in essential nutrients , promise not just to rejuvenate the soil but to transform farming itself . Despite an 18pc yield drop compared to conventional methods , organic farming shines with benefits that extend far beyond the field . It cuts down the carbon footprint , fuels community development , and spurs rural job creation . Economically , it stands strong with reduced input costs and better prices for organic produce , Dr Ali added . <p> Amidst these hopeful changes , Gohram Baloch criticises the green revolution 's damage , advocating for a return to more sustainable practices . <p> Farmers attend a training session @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit analysis is done , seven to eight bags of DAP and urea are used which cost around Rs18,000 to Rs7,000 respectively . However , organic farming now thrives with just Rs22,000 for five acres -- a fraction of the cost . <p> This June , IDSP 's review meetings revealed a breakthrough -- farmers have broken the cycle of debt and interest that once defined their existence ; their financial struggles a thing of the past , Baloch declared . <h> Seed of hope <p> The IDSP now plans to spread its success across five districts . The vision is to further empower farmers by shifting organic fertiliser production from centralised units to their own hands . <p> The transformation does n't stop there . With IDSP 's district-level setup , farmers will also gain access to local seed storage , fostering independence and sustainability . This initiative is n't just about farming -- it 's about reshaping the future of agriculture , district by district , said Baloch . <p> IDSP is now also championing a brighter future with its initiative , ' Seed of Hope ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line of organic products such as flour , mustard oil , and millet , " said Gohram . At Karachi 's farmer market , the vision comes full circle as farmers are encouraged to sell directly , cutting out middlemen and ensuring fair profits . The purpose extends beyond selling produce ; it 's to empower farmers and bring hope to the forefront of agriculture , he concluded .

He added that the three bilateral creditors had agreed to roll the loans over on the existing terms and conditions . <p> The IMF had announced a staff-level agreement for the $7 billion last month subject to the approval of the Executive Board and securing financing commitments from the bilateral and multilateral creditors . <p> The finance minister said that there was no point in asking for an increase in the interest rates on these loans when the country 's foreign exchange reserves had strengthened compared to a year ago .

Aurangzeb said that the government would wait for the IMF Board approval to get the commercial bank to cut its offered interest rates . <p> The finance minister said that two important developments had taken place in the last few days which showed that Pakistan was well on its way to achieving macroeconomic stability .

However , Fitch last week improved the rating by one notch -- from CCC to CCC+ -- which was still below the investment grade . <p> The finance minister said that the government was trying to issue the Panda bond in the Chinese markets and had engaged a Chinese financial adviser firm to complete the transaction either by the end of this calendar year or in early 2025 . <p> The minister said that the government was also contemplating hiring another Chinese financial adviser for securing the energy debt rollover .

@@112130230 <h> Death , where is thy sting ? <p> The killing of Hamas Politbureau chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran , presumably by Israel , has not been claimed as its work , raises a vast array of questions , while at the same time answering a few . <p> Perhaps the most salient feature of the murder is that it came right after the signing of the Beijing Declaration by a number of Palestinian organizations , including Hamas . Previous talks between Hamas and Al-Fatah have been about the holding of fresh elections ( the last were in 2006 , and both the Palestinian Liberation Organization and Hamas , can not claim that their mandates are particularly recent . ) <p> It should be noted that this massacre by Israel is something the Netanyahu government seems committed to , even as it embarrasses Israel 's supporters the world over .

However , China managing that reconciliation means it is doing what the USA could not do . There are two reasons why this is particularly galling for the USA . First , there is its antipathy to China because of their global rivalry . Then there is its intervention in the Middle East , an area in which it has recently begun to take an interest , with a major recent success being its successful mediation between Saudi Arabia and Iran . <p> China is interested in the Middle East for the same reason the USA is , oil .

It does not want to end up like Russia if the Taiwan situation leaves it facing US sanctions . Its access to Middle East oil dovetails with its need to secure the Indian Ocean and China Sea routes which allow it access . That is what makes CPEC so important : then the oil only needs to get to Gwadar before landing onto a secure route to China . <p> Surprisingly , India is also involved in the matter .

At the same time , India is also deeply interested in the Middle East , primarily because of the oil there . It must be remembered that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a superpower , is getting involved in the Middle East which does not have a significant Jewish population . The USSR was generally opposed to Israel because of its own direct ties to the Palestine Liberation Organization and to the Arab states like Egypt and Syria .

India and Israel realised that they both had to deal with a large an intractable Muslim minority , and it is to be noticed that they have been following essentially the same policy in dealing with them .

Shinwar is the same age as Haniyeh , and like him is a product of the Gaza refugee camps . Their families became refugees after fleeing from the same town , Ashkelon , in what is now Israel . Both he and Haniyeh took degrees in Arabic literature from the Gaza Islamic University , and both had been jailed by the Israelis , Haniyeh thrice for short periods , Shinwar for v22 years between 1989 and 2011 , until he was released in a prisoner exchange .

" <p> Tehmina Khaled <p> I retract my question . She certainly is . <p> Nimra Kashif <p> Nimra Kashif dabbled with the idea of starting her own design business for the longest time before she finally went ahead with it . The timing had to be right and , with young children and living in a joint family , she wanted to be fully prepared before she plunged into a designing career . <p> She took some initial steps before the pandemic -- roaming through markets , purchasing fabric , working with embroiderers -- before finally , in 2021 , her eponymous label was launched formally . <p> In three-odd years , Nimra 's business has mushroomed rapidly , and credit for this goes as much to her eye for aesthetics as to her astute marketing strategies .

" She recalls , " When Ushna Shah and Shaista Lodhi wore my designs in ARY Digital 's Jeeto Pakistan game show in Ramazan , I got a lot of queries ! " <p> And having taken her time to launch her professional career , how is Nimra managing the balancing act between work and home ? " My children are older now , so that helps , " she says .

Luckily , I have a very supportive husband and I am able to balance everything out . <p> " It helps that I love what I do ! " <p> Nida Mumtaz <p> Nida Mumtaz 's acting career can be traced back to PTV 's heydays , when she ventured on to the screen as a leading lady . However , there are long gaps spacing out her various acting projects until the present day , when she 's much more visible on screen playing maternal roles in multiple TV dramas . <p> " I have taken breaks in my acting career and I do n't regret it , " says the veteran actress . " My children were young and I felt that they needed me at home . I did n't want them trailing after me on drama sets , getting distracted and their routines falling out of order . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this profession , it is all right to take a break and , then , join back after some time , once you feel that you can manage the timings . " <p> But joining back into Pakistani entertainment is n't really a cakewalk . Competition for acting roles is tough and , when Nida rejoined the fray , a number of other senior actresses had also gained popularity as TV drama matriarchs . High-end drama productions were few and far between and a number of actors would be clamouring for the same role . Not everyone got signed on . Not everyone managed to make an impact . Does she miss the time when she would be the leading lady ? <p> " No , there is a time for everything , " she says . " I just found my way into acting . My mother was in the profession , as was my uncle , and it was just a natural progression for me . I returned to the industry once my daughter got done with her A-levels . Acting has now become much more lucrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also , I feel so proud when I travel outside of Pakistan and people tell me that they are watching our dramas . They just do n't remember me for my present-day work but also remember the older PTV dramas . Having said that , I do n't miss the old days at all . " <p> She adds , " I have always been sensible . I enjoy my career and I enjoy my time at home . And I just quietly go about my work . The audience appreciates my work as do my peers . And at this point in my life , I am enjoying improving and pushing myself further with every new performance ! " <p> Shaista Lodhi <p> " It 's very important for women to stand on their own two feet . And to strengthen themselves , not just financially but also emotionally , " says Shaista Lodhi . <p> She has applied this mandate very well to her own life . From being one of TV 's most popular morning show hosts for more than a decade , Shaista did an about-turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrepreneur . The TV career was set aside as she studied various courses , honed her skills and eventually launched her first aesthetics clinic . <p> " It was a one-room clinic , " she recalls , " because that was all that I could afford at the time . I was aware , though , that perhaps people expected something more grand from me because of my reputation as a morning show host . " <p> Slowly , surely , she steered the SL Aesthetics Clinic towards expansion . " I now own five clinics across Pakistan , with the sixth in the pipeline , " says Shaista . " I also work in collaboration with two other clinics and visit them regularly . And I just got on board the University of Lahore 's aesthetic department as a visiting faculty member ! " <p> The ' SL ' umbrella has further expanded to include a number of other brands : the SL Basics line runs the gamut from haircare to skincare , make-up and bodycare ; SL Naturals is an organic food brand offering a range of natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently launched clothing line and SL Foundation is a philanthropic organisation working on various projects . There is also SL Digital , a work in progress , which will aim to introduce a variety of programmes through social media platforms such as YouTube and Instagram . <p> She has also been making occasional forays into acting ; for instance , in the drama Pardes , opposite Sarmad Khoosat and , more recently , opposite Aijazz Aslam in the drama Fanaa . What steered her in that particular direction ? <p> " It 's something that I had always wanted to do , so I decided to give it a try , " she tells Icon . " And both these projects had such great scripts . I got the chance to work with and become friends with some amazing people , like Sarmad Khoosat and Marina Khan ! " <p> She has a busy work schedule but , as her children grow up and leave home , can her personal life be lonely ? She heaves a sigh . " Yes , very . You 're fine as long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come home and the loneliness can really hit you . It 's difficult , but I seek strength in prayer . " <p> There are lessons to be learnt from Shaista Lodhi 's journey ; of resilience , ambition and having self-respect . Many years ago , the morning show audience was drawn to her because of the examples that she set on TV . She 's still setting some fine examples . <p> Tehmina Khaled <p> It was destiny . Tehmina Khaled had n't considered becoming a PR consultant . Her career as a journalist had already spanned 18 years when she left her job at a major newspaper due to creative differences . She was searching for a new job when her good friend , designer Rizwan Beyg , reached out to her . <p> It was the year 2009 . The Fashion Pakistan Council ( FPC ) -- the Karachi-based council representing fashion in Pakistan -- was about to stage its first-ever fashion week and Rizwan , as chairperson , and Ayesha Tammy Haq , as the Council 's CEO , wanted to have a meeting with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convinced Ayesha that Tehmina would be just the person to handle the many nitty-gritties involved in hosting Fashion Pakistan Week ( FPW ) . With Hum TV 's newly launched fashion channel -- Style 360 , remember ? -- officially on board , Tehmina planned out an extensive pre-hype campaign . Designers were interviewed and videos were made of their ateliers , as they put the final touches to their fashion week collections . <p> The fashion week itself became a historic event -- it took place around the same time as a Taliban attack in another part of the country . The models on the catwalk and the gruesome images from the militant attack were published in the local and international press simultaneously . <p> The second FPW took place some months later and major international publications were invited . Carla Powers of Vogue was so impressed by the show that the decision was taken to feature Pakistani fashion in Vogue 's prestigious September issue . Tehmina coordinated back and forth , sent out e-mails and arranged images . The international coverage of the show will always be remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once she had expertly reigned in the fashion week behemoth , Tehmina 's career in PR was jump-started . There were new clients who wanted to take her on board and plenty of queries . <p> " I had n't thought of a name for my company till then , " Tehmina recalls . " My husband actor and musician Khaled Anum had launched a company called Take II Theatre and registered the name . He suggested that I could take up the Take II name . ' Take ' is an acronym for the names of the members of our family and , eliminating the ' Theatre ' part , that 's how Take II PR started . " <p> The rest is history . <p> She adds , " And yet , despite the years that I have invested into this field and the impressive number of events and projects that I have represented , I still hear the occasional snide comment from my male peers . ' Will women now be handling PR ? ' I heard recently . Men like to play the woman card more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , our work should speak for itself rather than our genders ! " <p> Her sons , now grown up , are building their own respective careers and Tehmina 's Take II PR is now a well-established , thriving business -- what 's next for her ? <p> " I want to start taking out more time for my family , to travel , read and become more selective about the projects that I take on . My career in PR was borne out of my passion for Pakistani fashion and , at this point , when I have worked with some of Pakistan 's most established , prestigious individuals and organisations , I want to pick and choose projects that excite me . " <p> Faiza Lakhani <p> Women want to wear what Faiza Lakhani is wearing . Pirouetting on to their Instagram feed , fluttering a gorgeous silk dupatta , she makes them peer a bit closer at their cell phone screen , zooming in on the design details , before possibly checking out the label that she is wearing . <p> Later , in another Instagram reel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d ? cor or cosmetics or more clothes -- and women zoom in yet again . They want to buy what she is buying . As a social media influencer , Faiza can be pretty convincing . <p> However , Faiza 's career did n't start off with these very well-planned Instagram reels . Back in 2012 , she took a break from her banking profession and had the idea to launch a website dedicated to curated fashion content in Pakistan . It was merely going to be a creative outlet for her , since she enjoyed both writing and fashion . <p> The website -- Secret Closet -- was a hit , and its popularity brought in a set of challenges . Faiza recounts , " When we first started , we were simply creating content in order to build an audience .

Secret Closet was the first of its kind in Pakistan and there was no set monetisation model to follow . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> She continues : " Another challenge was when Instagram came along .

Until then , I had never planned to be in front of the camera as much as I am now . When there was a lockdown , there were no events , shows or exhibitions . So , I and even others started dressing up and styling ourselves at home , creating content . <p> " Things just took off from there . When we started out , I think we were Pakistan 's only fashion-centric online publication . With Instagram , many more pages and blogs were launched . I think , in our own way , we helped the influencer profession to grow in Pakistan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secret Closet ? " As long as I am working and enjoying my work , I do n't overthink too much , " she says . " I do n't want to be part of any rat race and enjoy having balance and flexibility in my life . <p> " If I were to mention one thing , it would be that I hope Secret Closet becomes a regional platform . Pakistani fashion is beloved around the world and , as the industry grows , so can we ! " <p> Moomal Shunaid <p> Roaming through the Moomal Productions ' office building is like taking a trip down TV drama memory lane . Framed all along the walls are posters of the many hit dramas that the production house has steered over the years . Some had stormed ahead in the ratings race , others had won massive critical acclaim , quite a few had been showered with awards and had jump-started the careers of the actors that had been part of the cast . <p> The latest jewel in Moomal Productions and , more specifically , its CEO Moomal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Farooq Rind-directed drama , starring actors Bilal Abbas Khan and Durefishan Saleem , proved to be an all-out hit , hauling in high ratings and a huge fan following around the world . <p> Talking to Icon , Moomal observes , " I really believe that Divine intervention ensures the success of a drama . There have been times when a drama has taken ages to go on the floor . Directors keep coming and going , actors keep getting changed and you get so frustrated that your morale hits an all-time low . The only thing that keeps you going is that you have an entire production team working with you and you have to keep trying to get the drama shoot started off . It could take six months , even a year . <p> " And then , there are dramas which start shooting within two months of the script 's finalisation . In the case of Ishq Murshid , I think the good intentions and great vibes shared by everyone on set played a huge role .

I had thought that the song was very old-school , like a track from the 1940 's , and that people would n't like it . But it became so popular ! " <p> Home , she tells me , played a pivotal role in steering her career . Her mother-in-law , Hum Network President Sultana Siddiqui , was instrumental in getting her started . " She would share scripts with me and ask me to read them , " recalls Moomal . " She had taken early retirement from PTV at the time and was working freelance . When she launched her production house , she named it after me . <p> " Then , when she was directing the drama Marvi , she trusted me with the job of calling the drama 's writer Noor ul Huda Shah and asking for the remaining episodes in the script . That 's how I started off . Noor ul Huda Shah and my mother-in-law were my mentors , and I became very involved in the scripting process . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the inception of the Hum TV channel , " she continues . " Once they had obtained the licence , they started preparing a year before the channel went on air . I would have the morning free at the time , till the afternoon when the children came home , and I also got involved in the scripting . <p> " My office simply started from home . I would meet writers , go over scripts . I had always loved reading and writing , so it all came naturally to me . Eventually , I began writing my own scripts too . I have written many long plays , including a soap called Saiqa , starring Ahsan Khan and Juggun Kazim , and Pani Jaisa Pyar , starring Ahsan Khan and Saba Qamar . I took a break for a few years when I left to live in the US . On returning , I headed the script department at Hum TV for some time and , then , about 10 years ago , I branched out into production . " <p> Moomal is undeniably one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that women have it more difficult when it comes to building their careers ? <p> " Yes , it is more challenging because , in our culture , the responsibility of handling the home also primarily falls upon the woman . Still , I feel happy to see so many women entrepreneurs . It is difficult to balance family with career but , with the right planning and passion , it is possible ! " <p> Rubina Qaimkhani <p> One could say that Rubina Qaimkhani -- Senator for the Pakistan People 's Party ( PPP ) and head of its Sindh Women Wing -- was predestined to have a political career .

Her mother served the party for 30 years , working closely with the late Benazir Bhutto on several projects and programmes .

I had always been very sensitive and my son 's death has made me even more emotional , particularly when I witness the cruelty directed towards children . <p> " There have been times when I have visited the Child Protection Bureau and have had goosebumps when I have met with abused children .

@@112242235 <h> No more custodial torture <p> Police in our country is synonymous to torture and violence . It resorts to inhuman treatment and brutality when it yearns to yield the words of its own choice from the mouth of the accused . It has become so infamous in this regard that when a judge confers upon police physical remand of any accused , it is perceived by the general populace as if police has been licensed to commit torture upon the accused . However , physical remand does n't aim at subjecting the person in custody to physical or mental torment as perceived by the general public but to interrogate the accused about the matter under investigation in order to collect evidence . <p> Painfully penned in our country custodial torture is deemed as part and parcel of criminal investigation . It is viewed as an unofficially sanctioned component of criminal probe . Normally , it is resorted to extract evidence , despite this being prohibited under article 14 ( 2 ) of the constitution . <p> Custodial torture in Pakistan has myriad forms ; it encompasses physical torture , intimidation and threats ( mental torture ) sleep deprivation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violations but also violate Pakistan 's obligations under various international treaties , particularly United Nations convention against torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ( UNCAT ) which the country signed in 2008 and ratified in 2010 . <p> This centralization of expertise and authority ensures a streamlined , specialized approach by a neutral and independent agency . <p> Fortunately , with enactment of Torture and Custodial death ( Prevention and punishment ) act 2022 , the teething power of police which it has been employing to meet its nefarious ends since its establishment under English rule has been taken away . Under this act , Police have no authority to cause even slightest harm to the body of a person in custody . However , if it nevertheless does so , severe punishment commensurate to the harm meted out to a person in custody would be given to one who perpetrates such torture . <p> Before delving into profundity of the act , I find it exceedingly necessary to elaborate some basic concepts like custody , torture , custodial torture , custodial death , custodial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Torture and custodial death ( prevention and punishment act 2022 . <p> The term " custody " includes all situations where a person is detained or deprived of his liberty by any person , including a public official or by any other person working in an official capacity irrespective of legality nature and any place of such detention . It includes judicial custody and all forms of temporary and permanent restraint upon the movement of a person by law or by force or by other means . In addition , a person shall be deemed to be in custody during search , arrest and seizure proceedings . <p> The term ' torture ' has been explained in Section 2 ( n ) of the Act of 2022 in following words Torture " means an act committed by which severe physical pain or physical suffering , is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession , punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed , or intimidating or coercing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on discrimination of any kind , when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity . <p> Moreover , section 2 ( h ) expounds " custodial death " as the death of a person while in custody , directly or indirectly caused by and attributable to acts of torture committed upon the deceased while in custody ; it includes death occurring in police , private or medical premises , in a public place or in a police or other vehicle or in jail . It even includes death occurring while a person is being arrested or taken into detention or being questioned ; and all cases where the death of a person after his release from custody is directly caused by and may be substantially attributed to acts committed upon the deceased while in custody . <p> " Custodial rape " refers to instances where an individual exploits his position to commit rape or sexual abuse on a person under his custody or in the custody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captures the misuse of authority to violate the personal integrity and rights of those detained . <p> Coming to the investigation , the most encouraging aspect of the act is that police have no mandate to probe into the matters of custodial torture and deaths but a specialized agency supervised by human rights commission is supposed to perform this task . The Act of 2022 establishes a twofold mechanism for oversight in the investigation of offenses perpetrated by public officials under its provisions . The primary tier confers exclusive jurisdiction upon the Agency , making it the sole authority empowered to investigate specific allegations of custodial torture , deaths and rapes against public officials . This centralization of expertise and authority ensures a streamlined , specialized approach by a neutral and independent agency . Consolidating skills and decision-making power within a dedicated entity guarantees investigations are conducted with impartiality , precision , and a thorough understanding of the complexities involved . <p> The second tier of oversight has been provided by the supervision of the investigation process by the Commission . This supervision is crucial as it introduces an additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a commitment to human rights standards . While investigating offenses under the Act of 2022 , the Agency is endowed with the same powers and is required to adhere to the procedure outlined in the Federal Investigation Agency Act , 1974 ( Act VIII of 1975 ) , and the rules established thereunder . <p> Moreover , section 5 of the act of 2022 is a non-obstante clause having an overriding effect over any other conflicting provisions of law . The phrase non-obstante is Latin for ' notwithstanding ' , indicating that the specific provision will prevail despite anything to the contrary in other laws . Moreover , all the offenses under the Act of 2022 are cognizable in nature . A cognizable offense denotes a crime for which a police officer is empowered to make an arrest without a warrant . <p> Another worth-mentioning provision deserving applause is section 4 which deals with Custody of females ; it stipulates that no female shall be detained in order to extract information regarding the whereabouts of a person accused of any offence or to extract evidence from such female . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it inadequately addresses the problem of illegal detention because it is limited to females only . The practice of detaining male relatives of an accused to extract evidence or determine whereabouts is common in our investigation dispensation and has been recognized and condemned by superior courts . <p> With regard to penalties provided under this act ; section 8 of the act says that any public official who commits or abets or conspires to commit torture shall be punished with same punishment as prescribed for the type of harm provided in chapter XVI of the Pakistan penal code and for custodial death section 9 provides that whoever commits or abets or conspires to commit the offence of custodial death , shall be punished with the same punishment as prescribed in section 302 of PPC . However , the grey side of penalties provided under this act is that it does not provide punishments for torture and custodial death itself but falls back on already stipulated punishments in PPC which do not correspond completely with the nature or gravity of the crime and custodial death . Additionally , the prescribed punishments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the UNCAT and international standards because they lack specificity and do n't punish specific crime of torture . <p> It is pertinent to mention here that the most discouraging part of this legislation is provided in section 11 of the act which deals with malafide complaint . It eclipses the whole efficacy and object of the act since it instills fear among the complainants to lodge genuine complaints against public officials . Section 11 states that " whoever files a malafide complaint shall , after it is established that the complaint was malafide , be punished with the same punishment as prescribed under section 8 for the perpetrator under this act " . This provides a legal means to coerce and harass complainants in a system of skewed power , leaving the process open to manipulation by public officials . <p> To cap it all , despite some lacunas which warrant tweaking ; the act is overall a phenomenal piece of legislation . The need of the hour is to disseminate awareness among the people about this act so that undue fear of police is removed from our society and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

@@112242237 <h> Africa : Roaring into Action -- III <p> The third and final part focuses both on avenues of trade as well as bottlenecks which are hindering commercial ties for Pakistani investors . Africa imports 40 percent of its grain from Russia . This is despite 65 percent of global arable land being on the African continent . <p> This presents significant trade and investment opportunities , driven by the continent 's diverse climatic conditions , soil types , and farming practices . By 2050 , it 's projected that a majority of Africa 's population will reside in urban areas , a shift that will more than triple the number of urban dwellers from current figures . This urban demographic typically favours convenient food choices , such as prepared meals or restaurant dining , which aligns with their lifestyle . <p> Additionally , rising incomes in these urban areas are leading to increased purchasing power . This economic upliftment results in a demand for a more varied diet , with a growing preference for animal-based proteins , prepared cereals , fats , sugars , and fruits and vegetables . However , current production trends suggest that Africa 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demands of its expanding population . This gap between demand and domestic production highlights the immense potential for exporting agricultural products to Africa , catering to its evolving and expanding market needs . Pakistan , as done by China and India , can rent the fertile agricultural land in Africa to produce food not only for its own growing needs but also for re-export to earn valuable foreign exchange . Additionally , this can also be done through joint ventures in which the profit is shared between the Pakistani and African partners . <p> The pharmaceutical sector in Africa presents a substantial opportunity for Pakistan . WHO reports from 2021 indicate that African countries imported about 70-90 percent of their drugs in 2019 , valued at an estimated $14 billion . Despite representing nearly 25 per cent of the global demand for vaccines , Africa produces only 0.1 per cent . Pakistan remains a minor player in pharmaceutical manufacturing , with exports primarily in generics and limited to a few markets . However , there is a significant untapped potential for Pakistani pharmaceutical exports . From an export value of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew to US $218 million in 2019 and further to US $250 million by 2021 . <p> Without a dedicated officer studying and analyzing the market as well as identifying items of trade and investment , it is not possible to enhance trade with Africa . <p> African nations like Nigeria , Congo , Ethiopia , and South Africa are key markets for pharmaceuticals and surgical instruments . Pakistan 's major export destinations in Africa currently include Nigeria ( $31.28 million ) , South Africa ( $161.67 million ) , and Kenya ( $310.99 million ) . Expanding Pakistan 's pharmaceutical exports to these and other emerging African economies/markets could notably enhance the industry 's growth and contribute substantially to Pakistan 's exports to the region . With the increasing middle class and rapid urbanization in Africa , the Information Technology Services sector has witnessed substantial growth in recent years .

This project aims to connect Africa 's 54 countries with India and with each other , facilitating knowledge sharing in telecoms , medicine , health , resource mapping , and e-governance .

Despite the unlimited opportunities that Africa presents , the continent also presents its own unique set of challenges . The challenges can be summarized as follows . <p> Limited Interactions at Institutional level : Limited engagement at the leadership level means that such connections can not be leveraged to promote the interests of Pakistan . It is important to note that around 50 African countries have Presidential systems , which are centralized in nature . If the President agrees to something , it is promptly implemented by the system . In such a scenario , leadership-level contacts assume greater significance , which could unlock potential areas of cooperation and viable projects . <p> Since 2014 the only high-level visit from Pakistan was that of former President Mamnoon Hussain , who visited Nigeria in 2014 . Except Senegalese President in 2016 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Head of State/Government to Pakistan in recent years . Of the 54 African nations , 27 are members of the OIC . Pakistan also holds an observer status of the African Union , which it utilizes to develop high-level contacts with the African leadership . There exists a lot of goodwill for Pakistan for its role in UN peacekeeping . Ibrahim Yacoubou , Minister for Foreign Affairs of Niger is a graduate of the Foreign Service Academy and Dr Samia Suluhu Hassan , President of Tanzania attended public management course in Pakistan in 1988 . <p> Thin Diplomatic and Commercial Presence : Pakistan has diplomatic missions in just 20 countries in Africa , out of which 18 are currently functional ( Sudan and Somalia are closed ) . The rest of the 35 countries in Africa are concurrently accredited to our ambassadors . Given the meagre human and financial resources provided to the Ambassadors , it is not possible to cover the whole of Africa adequately . <p> In contrast , India has 47 Missions in 55 African countries , while T ? rkiye has set up 45 Embassies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only nine have Commercial posts , of which only seven are operational .

Without a dedicated officer studying and analyzing the market as well as identifying items of trade and investment , it is not possible to enhance trade with Africa . <p> Attitudinal and Mindset Challenges : While limited interaction and thin diplomatic and commercial presence in Africa are challenges , they are rooted in attitudinal biases and stereotype mindsets . Diplomatic and commercial officials are not provided with sufficient resources to carry out their work . Even proposals sent by diplomatic missions in Africa for high-level visits are put on the back burner . Africa is the lowest in the priority list of MOFA and MOC .

There is no Pakistani bank in Africa , nor is there an African bank in Pakistan . This leads to difficulties in the opening of Letters of Credit and transfer of funds . Some transactions are currently taking place through European banks , which have a presence in Africa .

@@112242238 <h> Trichotomy of Interests <p> In my short article ' National Interests versus Public Interests ' published in Daily Times , Pakistan , I argued " The states have their interests usually referred to as national interests , however , these interests may or may not always be in sync with the public interests . " <p> However , I restricted my argument to security interests only . But , in this article , I will take the argument to another level to include the regime 's interests , which often supersede all other interests of the ruling elite to stay in power . <p> We commonly read and hear about the trichotomy of power that includes legislature , judiciary , and the government . Media is often referred to as the fourth pillar of the state . However , I intend to introduce a trichotomy of interest among the three stakeholders : the government or regime , the establishment , and the people . <p> Let me explain the respective interests of each of these stakeholders of any state who shape the policies and the future of their state . <p> First , the establishment includes all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , judiciary , civil societies , etc . The establishment of any state usually safeguards the national interests of the state . However , one can debate the selection of national interests and priorities-more on this after explaining to other stakeholders . <p> The establishment of any state usually safeguards the national interests of the state . <p> Second , the regime includes the ruling elite , the respective mafias like the military-industrial complex in the developed West , and the hoarding mafias in the developing states . The regime 's interests lie in its survival in the power corridors so that it can continue the loot and plunder of the state resources . <p> Finally , the people , are the most important element of any state . The public interests are supposed to be looked after by the regime that gets elected by the same people . Unfortunately , regimes do not care for public interests due to which regimes become unpopular and people remain dissatisfied . <p> Having learnt a little about the stakeholders in any state , let 's now look at the respective interests and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As stated earlier , usually the establishment guards the state 's national interests because any threat to the state from the enemy within or without would ultimately hurt their capacity to perform . For instance , political instability can not be in the interest of the establishment of any state because it can throw the state into chaos which will have to be handled by them only . The governments come and go and come back again . Still , the state institutions are the permanent bodies and remain the only source to look up to the people -- More so because the people can change the governments but not the Judges , Generals , and Public Servants . <p> The regimes on the other hand can play the national interests for the sake of domestic politics . It may happen in any state , developing or developed . The Bush Administration played on the fake folders to attack Iraq in 2003 , and the Modi government played on Pulwama for his reelection in 2019 . There are numerous examples where the regimes played on with the national interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The regimes where the power can remain with a particular leader for an unlimited period do it more often because he/she does not want the leave the power corridors at any cost . To hang onto power , the regimes could care less for the national interests or the public interests . However , such regimes can not do so without adequate support of the establishment . <p> Therefore , whenever the interests of the regime and the establishment converge , the government lasts longer . However , if the public interest is ignored for a longer period , they may revolt against the regime and at that stage , the establishment is faced with the dilemma of who to choose . Perhaps , the same happened in Sri Lanka and now in Bangladesh . In most situations , the establishment chooses to side with the people because it does not want chaos in the state as it may hurt the national interests in the short to medium term . Moreover , in developing states , the establishment does not wait for too long and intervenes in its way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests are protected and the public does not feel alienated . <p> It is in this context , that I suggest that the establishment and the regimes must give respect for public opinion and give priority to public interests so that people remain behind their elected governments and respect their institutions as well . <p> In my opinion , peoples ' well-being must be kept as a top priority as part of national interests so that regimes do not turn their backs on people 's interests and the establishments also do not have to invest their energies on issues that are supposed to be handled by the regimes and not the establishment . <p> The writer of this article has authored three international books : " Nuclear Deterrence and Conflict Management Between India and Pakistan " " South Asia Needs Hybrid Peace " and " Understanding Sun Tzu and the Art of Hybrid War .

This day reminds the nation that the dreams of the Founding Fathers are yet to be realised , and despite going from strength to strength there is a lot that needs to be done .

@@112365235 <h> Hasina 's blemished legacy <p> Sheikh Hasina , the progeny of Bangladesh 's founding patriarch Sheikh Mujibur Rahman , was once heralded as a transformative figure whose leadership ushered in an era of unprecedented economic prosperity for her nation . Under her aegis , Bangladesh experienced a remarkable surge in economic performance , characterised by a dramatic enhancement in export activity and an impressive elevation in the GDP growth rate . The taka gained considerable strength , and Bangladesh emerged as a rising economic titan within South Asia . These advancements , largely attributed to Hasina 's policies aimed at job creation and economic stimulation , particularly for women , signified a period of remarkable progress . <p> Despite these early successes , Hasina 's governance has increasingly drawn criticism and scrutiny , with her leadership increasingly likened to a dictatorial regime . This change can be attributed to three critical missteps that have not only overshadowed her earlier accomplishments but have also profoundly marred her legacy . <p> One of Hasina 's most consequential errors was her disregard for democratic principles . Although she initially espoused a commitment to democratic governance , her approach to handling political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties , ensuring that her party , the Awami League , maintained an unchallenged monopoly on power . This strategic sidelining of political rivals , coupled with the suppression of dissent , undermined the democratic fabric of Bangladesh . Hasina 's administration implemented a series of restrictive measures on media freedom , curtailing the ability of journalists and critics to openly challenge the government . The imposition of stringent censorship and the frequent shutdown of the internet were part of a broader strategy to stifle dissent and control the narrative . The lack of a robust opposition and unchecked power led to a governance style that increasingly resembled authoritarianism , rather than the democratic ideals Hasina once championed . <p> The second significant blunder in Hasina 's tenure was her unwavering defence of the controversial quota system in government jobs . Initially introduced by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in 1972 as a means to reward those who contributed to the country 's liberation , the system was intended to be a temporary measure . However , its continued application and expansion to subsequent generations became a source of widespread discontent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system , despite mounting protests and demands for change , highlighted a troubling disconnect between the government and the needs of the populace . The persistence of the quota system fueled widespread resentment , particularly among the youth . Hasina 's defence of the system , framed in terms of upholding her father 's legacy , was perceived as a failure to address the evolving socio-political landscape . Hasina 's rigid adherence to an outdated policy reluctance to acknowledge and address the grievances related to the quota system demonstrated a lack of adaptability and responsiveness to the legitimate concerns of the younger generation . <p> The most egregious mistake of Hasina 's administration was the brutal suppression of student protests . In recent years , demonstrations by students and young activists against various issues , including the quota system , were met with excessive force by state security apparatus , highlighting a severe breach of human rights . The sight of students being targeted and killed for protesting against perceived injustices was a stark contrast to the democratic values Hasina initially espoused . <p> The cumulative effect of these critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discriminatory quota system , and resorting to violent suppression of dissent - has profoundly impacted Sheikh Hasina 's legacy . While her early achievements in economic development were notable , these subsequent actions have overshadowed her successes and contributed to a perception of her leadership as increasingly authoritarian .

He has also served as chairman of the Pakistan Ordnance Factories Board <p> 14th August is a day of celebration for all of us . It is the day when Pakistan as a separate entity of India was born as an expression of the free will of the Muslims of India . It is also a time to reflect as to how Pakistan has fared in these seventy-six years and what prospects hold for the future . <p> The politics has been mostly chaotic and unprincipled and democracy has not taken a firm footing . Lack of a democratic character within the parties has weakened democracy and there is no apparent effort to correct the weakness . Political parties are dominated by influential families , which is not an uncommon phenomenon even among mature and well- established democracies but their election to positions within the party are open and a recognition of their performance . <p> Ever since independence the military personnel have made huge sacrifices to uphold the integrity of the state . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence of bureaucracy in formulation of national policy and its implementation has adversely affected Pakistan 's democratic development . The adverse external and internal security situation of the country has been another major factor in increasing the influence of the army leadership . Due to lack of proper management of resources and relatively higher allocation of funds for maintaining credible defence , the country has been mired in debt that would take years to pay back the loans . <p> Relations with India , especially ever since PM Modi has been in power , have been extremely tense and volatile and the prospects of any improvement are very remote , although it was visualised that with the partition of the sub-continent , the two nations will be able to relate peacefully to each other to the benefit of their citizens . Only a peaceful relationship will provide an environment to unlock the full potential of the state and its people . In reality the opposite has happened , with the two countries having fought two wars and engaged in multiple high level serious skirmishes . <p> There was a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pakistan as they perceived or was articulated by the state . But that phase is over and now they realise the shortcomings and limitations of our system and those of our leadership . For them the provision of basics and security of theirs and of the family is paramount . The problem they see that elections alone are not delivering , especially when these are soiled by interference from outside and do not fully represent the will of the people . They consider being under threat from their leaders or institutions that reject pluralism and impose a one-party state that could be easily manipulated . But Pakistan was created by the will of the people to be a democratic state and there can be no compromise on that . <p> On the Western front Afghanistan will continue to remain a major security issue for Pakistan for the foreseeable future . The Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan , comprising mainly Pashtuns , operate freely on both side of the border as safe havens . Pakistan Army has taken several effective measures to counter hostile activity by TTP and others but the problem remains . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Afghanistan is in league with the TTP leadership and considers allowing it to operate freely on the border , and keeping pressure on Pakistan serves their interest . It is unfortunate that there is hardly any appreciation among the Afghan Taliban leadership that Pakistan played a vital role in stabilising Afghanistan and facilitating the formation of the government . It is , however , in the interest of both countries to cooperate on security and border management . <p> Lifting Pakistan 's economy and making the country self-reliant remains the biggest challenge . It is unfortunate that for the last seventy-six years , the country has relied on foreign assistance from IMF , World Bank and friendly countries for assistance . The troubling aspect is that there is no serious effort at developing a self-sustaining economy . This is despite the fact that Pakistan is endowed with abundance of natural resources and human capital . What is needed is a greater focus on education , health and infrastructure to maximise the potential of its people and harness the natural resources for the benefit of the people . <p> Administrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the people and is dragging the country down . Lack of road discipline and absence of any serious checking of defaulters have added to the misery of the ordinary citizen . Such brazen indifference and neglect of city infrastructure is being tolerated at a heavy cost and adding to the inconveniences of the people . It is also a sad reflection on the leadership as it demonstrates their callous attitude toward the people . <p> It is questionable if the present model of governance wherein Shehbaz Sharif is the PM and managing the affairs of the government while Nawaz Sharif living in London occasionally giving broad policy guide lines . It certainly is not a normal way of functioning and does not reflect well on the country . However , this is not to acknowledge that Shehbaz Sharif is clearly an experienced and an efficient administrator who is result-oriented . He is also known to have good relations with the army leadership and works closely with them in matters of mutual interest . <p> Pakistan 's future lies in state institutions functioning within their constitutional limits and seeking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is not seeking for the ideal but a necessary precondition for bringing stability and moving forward . Pakistani people have suffered due to politicians , military and bureaucracy ignoring these basics that are the foundation of good governance and fair play . <p> For a nation to pretend that this is normal and could continue is a form of escapism . The true potential of a nation only can be realised if the leadership focuses on good governance and stays within accepted democratic norms . As yet we are not there , so let 14th August reminds us that we have to work sincerely toward that goal .

Their roads , markets and residential areas are meticulously maintained . Honesty and fairness are integral to their dealings , not just with people but also with animals , reflecting their overall ethical standards . <p> In Pakistan , however , honesty and cleanliness are often lacking . Many products available in the market are of low quality , and services are poor . Items are frequently manufactured with substandard materials , resulting in short-lived products .

@@112627239 <p> The Pakistan Bureau of Statistics ( PBS ) has recently disseminated the detailed results of the 7th Population and Housing Census of Pakistan , completed in 2023 . This is the first digital Census in Pakistan and the largest in South Asia . There is need to recognize these extraordinary efforts by the leadership and the staff of the PBS . The key findings report is an outstanding publication . <p> However , many of the magnitudes emerging from the Census are worrying in character . There appears to have been a rise in the exponential annual population growth rate between the two Censuses of 2017 and 2023 , respectively . <p> It is estimated at 2.55% in the 2023 Census whereas in the inter-Censal period of 1998 to 2017 it was reported at 2.40% . If the current growth rate of 2.55% persists than by 2047 the population of Pakistan will rise by more than 83% from 241.5 million to over 441 million . This will undoubtedly put severe pressure on the availability of food and other necessities in the country . <p> There is also substantial variation in the population growth rate of the provinces between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth rate continues to be Balochistan , with a growth rate of 3.14% , followed by Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa with a growth rate of 2.82% . <p> The two larger provinces , Punjab and Sindh , have significantly lower population growth rates of 2.48% and 2.53% , respectively . However , these growth rates are still higher than those observed in the previous Census . <p> Another worrying development is the visibly faster rate of urbanization . The growth rate of urban population has been reported at 3.59% , compared to 2.97% in the last Census . Consequently , there has been a quantum jump in the size of the urban population from 2017 to 2023 by over 18 million . The level of urbanization has reached 38.8% , compared to 36.4% six years ago . <p> The number of rural-urban migrants is estimated at over 6 million from 2017 to 2023 . Consequently , the rate of growth of rural population has fallen to 1.86% , compared to 2.05% from 1998 to 2017 . This highlights the diminishing capacity of the rural economy , especially agriculture , to provide livelihood to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An analysis at the Provincial level reveals that the fastest rate of urbanization between 2017 and 2023 has taken place in Balochistan at 5.04% annually and in Punjab at 4.13% . It is 3.18% in Sindh . The big surprise is the decline in the share of the urban population in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa with the growth rate of urban population of only 0.71% . Sindh continues to be the most urbanized province with a share of urban population approaching 54% . <p> Turning to other key demographic indicators , there is need to focus on different aspects of the age distribution of population . The first indicator is the percentage of the population in the form of children from zero to 4 years . This percentage has increased from 14.11% in 2017 to 15.17% in 2023 . This tends to indicate a rising fertility rate , leading to faster population growth . <p> The second key indicator in the age distribution is the share of youth population , aged 15 to 24 years . There was a ' youth bulge ' reported in the 2017 Census , with the share rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18.59% in the 2023 Census . This implies that the peak of the youth bulge has passed . This should limit in future the increase in the number of ' idle ' youths in the country , estimated currently at over 18 million . <p> The perhaps surprising finding is the decline in average household size in the country . It has declined from 6.45 members on average in a household in 2017 to 6.30 in 2023 . This tends to indicate a transition to more nuclear families than joint households . However , the decline is in rural areas . It has actually gone up from 6.20 to 6.24 in the urban areas . <p> A matter of some interest , especially in the presence of a faster rate of urbanization , is the population growth of cities , with population above 1 million , between 2017 and 2023 . The findings are somewhat unexpected . <p> Despite a relatively fast rate of urbanization in Punjab , the two largest cities in the province , Lahore and Faisalabad , have shown relatively low growth rates of 2.61% and 2.32% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the population of cities in Pakistan is observed in the case of Rawalpindi of as high as 7.84% . This is in sharp contrast to the population growth rate of only 1.55% in the sister-city of Islamabad . The other city with an extraordinarily high rate of population growth of 7.48% is Quetta . Karachi continues to expand at a moderate rate of 4% . <p> The exception is Peshawar which has seen a decline in population between 2017 and 2023 . In this a reflection of exit of Afghan population or due to the breakdown of law and order , especially due to acts of terrorism , leading to migration ? <p> We focus now on some of the indicators related to education . The first key indicator is the literacy rate . It has apparently increased only modestly from 58.91% in 2017 to 60.65% in 2023 . Here again , there is a surprise . It has remained virtually unchanged at close to 68% in the case of males . Bulk of the increase in the literacy is in females . There is need for investigation as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ males in Pakistan . <p> The next education indicator is the number of out-of-school children , aged 5 to 16 years . The 2023 Census reports the number at as many as 25.37 million children . This implies that almost 36% of the children have not had an opportunity to go to school and improve their lifetime prospects . The high incidence of out-out-school children is truly an indictment of the education system of Pakistan . <p> There are many other trends in the population , housing and access to services that have been quantified in the 2023 Census . These will be highlighted in a subsequent article . 
@@112627240 <p> The near-zero current account balance is expected to continue , as a deficit of $162 million was posted on July 24 . This appears to be the new normal . There has been a slight increase in imports over the past few months , though they remain below $5 billion per month . This growth aligns with the uptick in remittances , which are approaching $3 billion per month , while exports are hovering close to their 12-month average . <p> This situation is likely to persist , as growth in exports is feeling challenged by the rising energy prices and higher taxation , which are discouraging expansion . The stable PKR and low levels of informal imports ( and reduced illegal wealth transfers ) are facilitating remittances through formal channels . Any further increase in imports , potentially driven by upcoming rate cuts , could pose risks to macroeconomic stability , particularly in terms of currency stability . <p> Therefore , the optimal approach is to gradually ease monetary policy and allow inflation to decrease more sustainably while maintaining the current account deficit close to zero . Achieving GDP growth beyond 3 percent may be undesirable under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion on July 24 , representing a 16 percent increase from the same month last year and a 9 percent rise from the 12-month average . However , this increase is not reflected in major sectors such as petroleum , food , and the adversely impacted transport sector . Petroleum imports are lower due to reduced prices and an influx of diesel from smuggled Iranian channels . Automobile imports are expected to remain low until interest rates fall below 15 percent , although palm oil imports in the food sector are increasing . <p> Other sectors showed decent growth in July 24 compared to the 12-month average , with the most significant increase in machinery imports ( up by 45 percent ) , particularly in mobile phones . There was also double-digit growth in the metal , textile , and miscellaneous sectors . <p> Exports in July were slightly lower than both the previous month and the 12-month average . Textile exports were almost at the 12-month average , but industry players are not optimistic about future months . <p> The trade deficit in goods reached $2.5 billion , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent more than the 12-month average . The deficit growth slowed to 13 percent and 27 percent , respectively , due to continued strong ICT exports , which totaled $286 million on July 24 . Companies and individuals are likely to repatriate more money through formal channels due to currency stability and increased allowances for money transfers . However , poor network connectivity and firewalls are causing frustration and reducing business opportunities , especially for freelancers . <p> The standout performer has been inward remittances , which averaged $3.1 billion over the past three months and were nearly $3 billion on July 24 . The strongest performance has come from Dubai , where many Pakistani companies are registering , and many individuals are relocating . Dubai has become a key financial hub for affluent Pakistanis , with those living there and earning money also contributing to remittance growth . <p> In the short term , the continued growth in remittances provides a silver lining for economic growth , though it will not fully address the country 's economic challenges , including the effects of Dutch disease .

Nearly a year later , the PBS has released the detailed findings of the 7th Population and Housing Census . <p> There is a shift of 133,978 from rural to urban population when compared with the summary population figures . In provinces , this decline of rural population was observed in Punjab and Sindh by 2,315 and 131,663 respectively with an equal increase in the urban population , so the provincial as well as national population remained unchanged . <p> Besides the above , a similar pattern of population addition and subtraction is observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Toba Tek Singh shows an increase of 12,081 people , exactly the number reduced from Jhang 's population . <p> Malir 's population is 28,289 higher than the summary findings , while Karachi East sees a reduction of the same amount . Surab and Kachhi districts gain 946 and 62 people , respectively . The increase in Surab reduces Kalat 's population , while the addition in Kachhi decreases Nasirabad 's count . <p> The only plausible explanation for these changes is that there may have been adjustments or corrections in the demographics of certain census blocks in Punjab and Sindh . Another possibility is the alteration of district boundaries , either on the ground or in the records indicated above , since all population additions and subtractions occurred in neighbouring districts . <p> However , these changes in demographic population and district population are inconsequential in the sense that they do not have any impact on the provincial or national population . <p> The overall and provincial populations by sex and sex ratio are very well elaborated in the detailed report of the PBS so we intend not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex ratio ( number of males per 100 females ) increased from 105 to 106 , which implies that overall there is one more male per 100 females . The sex ratio has increased in all provinces except Balochistan , where it decreased from 110.82 to 109.02 . In Balochistan , the proportion of the female population rose from 47.43% to 47.84% . <p> The population census data did not provide the disaggregation of South Waziristan as two separate districts and it also does not mention the newly formed districts of Taunsa , Kot Addu , Wazirabad , Talagang , Murree , Hub and Usta Muhammad as separate districts . <p> Generally , complying with overall sex ratio , the majority of the districts ( 127 out of 136 ) have a higher male population than female . Chaman district is an outlier where there are 12% more men than women . Similarly Dera Bugti and Sherani districts have 10% more male population . <p> Defying all odds , three districts in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa -- Hangu , Lower Dir , and Upper Dir -- have a higher female population . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buner , Gujrat , Mandi Bahauddin , Attock and Chakwal , which means populations of both genders are found equal at zero decimal point . <p> When comparing the proportions of the district female population of the 2023 census with the 2017 census , we observe a ? 3.0% deviation over six years . This comparison , done to zero decimal points to avoid deviations smaller than 0.5% , yields conclusive insights at the district level across the two most recent population censuses . <p> For the purpose of comparison , the number of districts was reduced to 129 from 136 . We consider Kohistan as a single district rather than three districts due to the availability of the 2017 census data . Similarly , Chitral is considered one district rather than Upper Chitral and Lower Chirtal . Karachi West &amp; Keamari , Kalat &amp; Surab , Loralai &amp; Duki and Killa Abdullah &amp; Chaman are treated as single districts . <p> Female population proportion increased in 37 districts and decreased in 49 districts . In 43 districts including Islamabad , the female population proportion remained unchanged -- the difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 17 districts show a decrease in female population proportion ; five have increased , while ten maintain the same female population proportions . <p> In Punjab , 18 districts have a decline in female population proportions , five districts show an increase , and 13 districts remain unchanged . <p> In Sindh , eight districts show a decrease , 12 show an increase , and nine maintain similar female population proportions . <p> In Balochistan , six districts have a decrease in female proportions , 15 districts show an increase , and ten districts have unchanged female population proportions . <p> The Kohistan district was split into three districts in the 2023 census , with the aggregate female population of all three districts comprising 48.96% , up from 45.88% in the 2017 census . Kohistan shows the highest increase in female proportions since 2017 . Following this , the female proportions of Kech and Quetta districts increased by 2.0% . The female population proportion of Kech rose from 45.66% to 47.66% , while in Quetta , it increased from 47.53% to 49.17% . <p> In 49 districts of Pakistan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest decrease in female population proportions is in the Orakzai district where female population proportion was 49.83% in the 2017 census while it declined to 47.17% . Up to a 2.0% decrease in female population proportions is observed in nine districts -- Dera Bugti , Gujrat , Jhelum , Karak , Kharan , Killa Abdullah &amp; Chaman , Kurram , Narowal and Washuk . <p> Bottom line : There are some paradoxical deviations between the detailed report and the summary findings . The 2023 Census reveals an increase in the sex ratio , indicating a decline in the proportion of the female population . <p> Gender proportions in districts show a deviation of ? 3.0% compared to the 2017 Census . A decline in female population proportions was noted in 49 districts , while the remaining districts either maintained the same proportions or showed an increase in female population proportions .

@@113624233 <h> Xinjiang , Balochistan and FATA <p> In Pakistan , we often adhere to the belief that force is the primary solution for dealing with terrorists , extremists , separatists , insurgents , and even civil unrest , whether it involves political , religious parties , students , or civil society . The prevailing notion is that if force does n't achieve the desired outcome , more force should be applied . <p> In contrast , China 's approach in Xinjiang , where separatism , Pan-Islamism , and Pan-Turkism have been significant issues since 1949 , has been to respond with development . When challenges arise , China has chosen to accelerate development further . These two philosophies -- force versus development -- are starkly opposed and have yielded opposite results . <p> The insurgencies in Xinjiang , Balochistan , and Pakistan 's erstwhile Federally Administered Tribal Areas ( FATA ) have distinct historical , ethnic , and geopolitical contexts , yet they share similarities in grievances but differ markedly in the governmental responses . <p> The narratives of the insurgencies in Xinjiang , Balochistan , and FATA share more similarities than differences . <p> In Xinjiang , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repression , economic disenfranchisement , and ethnic discrimination . The insurgents frame their struggle as a fight for cultural survival and autonomy , often invoking the idea of an independent " East Turkestan . " <p> The Baloch insurgency , while lacking a religious element , is fueled by economic exploitation , particularly in natural resources like gas and minerals , political marginalization , and human rights abuses . As one of Pakistan 's least developed regions , many Balochs feel excluded from their wealth , seeking greater autonomy or independence , citing historical grievances and ongoing exploitation . <p> In FATA , the insurgency stems from resistance to Pakistan 's military operations , perceived interference in local customs , and the impact of the war on terror . The TTP , in particular , framed its struggle in religious terms , opposing the Pakistani state 's alignment with the US and seeking to impose its version of Sharia law . <p> When comparing the narratives of these three ethnic groups , the Uyghur and Taliban in FATA share more similarities , particularly in their use of religious connotations to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Baloch narrative is distinctive due to its focus on economic and political grievances , without a religious dimension . Consequently , the Baloch narrative may be easier to address or counter compared to the more deeply rooted and ideologically driven narratives of the TTP and Uyghurs . <p> To counter the Baloch insurgency and integrate the Baloch people into the national mainstream , the government only had to adopt a holistic approach to address the root causes of the conflict , including economic marginalization , political exclusion , and cultural grievances by investing in local development , ensuring fair resource distribution , and enhancing political representation while granting greater administrative autonomy to Balochistan . <p> On the contrary , the government response to deal with insurgency in Balochistan is normally perceived exactly the opposite . The propaganda war has inculcated the impression albeit without any conclusive evidence that the response of Pakistan 's government included military operations , targeted killings , and enforced disappearances . The media is rife with reports that tens of thousands of people , including insurgents , civilians , and security personnel , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Pakistan 's deadliest . <p> Similarly , the response of the Government to erstwhile FATA is perceived as primarily kinetic . Reportedly , the Pakistani government has conducted numerous military operations ( e.g. , Operation Zarb-e-Azb ) to dismantle militant networks . The insurgency and counter-insurgency operations have led to tens of thousands of deaths , including militants , security forces , and civilians . Displacement and destruction of infrastructure have also been significant . <p> Contrastingly , in Xinjiang , the Chinese government primarily pursued the policy of development which worked like magic . The region has purposefully made a lynchpin of China 's Belt and Road Initiative ( BRI ) . During the 13th Five-Year Plan period ( 2016-2020 ) , China invested over $100 billion in Xinjiang 's development . Substantial investment has also been made in infrastructure , industry , IT , and modern agriculture , as part of its broader strategy to integrate the region more closely with the rest of the country and to address the underlying economic disparities that contribute to unrest . <p> Xinjiang now boasts a state-of-the-art modern transportation network @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to major cities in China and neighbouring countries . Notable projects include the Urumqi-Hami section of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang high-speed railway , which links Xinjiang to the eastern provinces . The total investment in these transportation projects over the years runs into tens of billions of dollars . <p> The Baloch narrative may be easier to address or counter compared to the more deeply rooted and ideologically driven narratives of the TTP and Uyghurs . <p> Cities like Urumqi and Kashgar have been developed on ultramodern lines including the construction of modern residential areas , commercial centres , and public facilities and the development of " new towns " to accommodate the growing population and improve living standards . <p> Xinjiang has become a hub for energy production , particularly in coal , oil , and natural gas .

In addition , IT parks , advanced surveillance technologies , data centres , technology parks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technologies have been developed to attract domestic and foreign investment . <p> In the agriculture sector , China has introduced modern water management , crop genetics , and mechanization to substantially enhance the yield of cotton , grapes , and melons production , besides setting up large-scale farms , processing plants , and distribution networks . <p> These investments are part of China 's broader strategy to stabilize the region , boost economic growth , and integrate Xinjiang more closely with the rest of the country and the global economy , particularly through the Belt and Road Initiative . <p> Contrarily the investments in FATA and Balochistan pale in comparison to the scale of investment made by China in Xinjiang . While China 's investments in Xinjiang have transformed the region 's infrastructure and economy , Pakistan 's investments in FATA and Balochistan are insignificant and are plagued by issues like governance challenges , security concerns , and underutilization of funds no matter how meagre . <p> China 's investments in Xinjiang are part of a strategic focus on integrating the region into the national economy and the Belt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FATA and Balochistan have often been reactive , addressing immediate security concerns rather than being part of a long-term strategic vision for regional development . <p> If we genuinely aim to reintegrate FATA and Balochistan into the national mainstream , we must adopt the Chinese philosophy of development and more development . Without this focus on economic and social progress , the cycle of violence from both the government and insurgents will persist , leaving the regions mired in conflict and instability .

@@113875235 <h> On the edge of default <h> The former type of sovereign builds a reputation that it is unlikely to default <p> ByIrfan Ahmad Chatha <p> September 10 , 2024 <p> An undated image of $100 notes . -- AFP/File <p> As Pakistan looks for a spot on the IMF Board 's agenda , the prudent course during this downtime is to reflect on its debt sustainability and develop a broader understanding of the factors that have kept Pakistan amongst the ' commitment type ' of sovereign borrowers instead of ' opportunistic type ' . The former type of sovereign builds a reputation that it is unlikely to default . <p> Notwithstanding the importance of the complex scenarios incorporated in the debt sustainability analyses conducted by national and international stakeholders , let 's focus on the fundamental ' i -- g ' measure of debt sustainability . This denotes the difference between the average interest rate on government debt and the GDP growth rate . <p> When the differential is negative , it implies that the economy is growing faster than the interest rate on debt , making it easier for governments to manage their debt levels even with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has had negative difference only once . In five out of the last ten years , the difference was 10 percentage points or higher . This also explains the persistent upward trend in markup payments to GDP ratio . <p> One of the reasons for a positive i-g difference is accumulation of public debt . When a country has a higher stock of public debt , as is the case with Pakistan , then the risk premium on its government bonds rises , resulting in higher interest rates on otherwise safe and liquid assets ( for instance , government treasury bills ) . <p> High-yield government securities increase the misallocation of credit , leading to lower aggregate productivity and output . The evidence of misallocation lies in the banking system 's balance sheet . Investments are more than double the advances and the investments in government securities are higher than 90 per cent . <p> A higher dependency ratio ( the ratio of dependents to the working-age population ) is linked to a lower i -- g differential . This is because an aging population is assumed to save more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratio 12 percentage points higher than the average for lower middle- income countries , such dynamics do n't hold true for Pakistan because of lower tendency to save . The savings-to GDP ratio for Pakistan is 13 per cent whereas the average for lower middle-income countries is 19.2 per cent . <p> Debt sustainability heavily depends on the composition of debt - external vs domestic debt , and long-term vs short-term debt . Almost all the defaulting countries of this century had a higher external debt-to-GDP ratio . The recent default by Sri Lanka was also triggered by large external debt . As the country was unable to get timely financial assistance from international creditors , it had to default due to depletion of forex reserves . <p> Pakistan 's default risk in the last five years has also been stimulated by record high external debt-to-GDP ratio ( 37.6 per cent ) stemming from the depreciation of the rupee , slow economic growth and reliance on external assistance to finance mega infrastructure projects and current account deficits . <p> Nevertheless , one thing should be clear : unsustainable debt is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is usually considered less risky . But in a high interest rate period , domestic debt is as risky as external debt . <p> The role of debt tenor in debt sustainability is not straightforward . Short-term debt typically carries lower interest rates because lenders face less risk over a shorter period . However , the need to frequently refinance short-term debt exposes the borrower to the risk of rising interest rates , which can increase debt servicing costs and pressure debt sustainability . <p> While debt with longer tenors may have higher interest rates due to the increased risk over time , it offers more stability as the borrower locks in the interest rate for a longer period . This reduces the need for frequent refinancing and mitigates the risk of interest rate fluctuations , enhancing debt sustainability . <p> Successive governments of Pakistan have generally preferred long-term borrowing to short-term borrowing . The long-term debt share in total debt mostly remains above 65 per cent . Even in the last three fiscal years , when markets considered Pakistan at high default risk , the long-term debt was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no less than an achievement because the government 's ability to sell securities with longer maturities is a sign of investor confidence in the economy and government 's ability to repay . <p> Moreover , according to textbook logic , Pakistan was not at risk of default because during times of high default risk , sovereigns can easily raise short-term debt . This helps maintain fiscal discipline and reduces the likelihood of default by keeping the sovereign wary of consequences of its borrowing decisions immediately . <p> However , for practical reasons , short-term debt should have been preferred in recent years of higher interest rates . It would have allowed Pakistan to benefit from future decreases in interest rates . High-interest rates are often associated with economic uncertainty . Committing to long-term debt at high rates could increase the overall cost of borrowing for a long time , even after rates fall . Short-term debt typically has a lower coupon rate than long-term debt , which could reduce the immediate debt servicing burden . <p> Despite the debt sustainability challenges and the imperfect debt management , Pakistan has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the government 's demonstration of a strong commitment to maintaining fiscal discipline through various austerity measures , tax reforms , and public expenditure controls , albeit with varying degrees of success . Credit goes to Pakistan 's bilateral relationships as well for complementing its engagement with international financial institutions like the IMF , World Bank , and ADB . <p> The strongest domestic factor , however , is political will . In theory , sovereigns could default without facing direct legal consequences , yet most countries avoid default . The leading theoretical frameworks explaining the behaviour of sovereign borrowers particularly focus on the role of reputation in influencing borrowing costs and the likelihood of default . <p> Maintaining a good reputation is critical for sovereigns to continue accessing international credit markets . Defaulting can lead to exclusion from these markets or higher future borrowing costs . The decision to repay debt is not just an economic one but also deeply political . The interaction between economic costs , political pressures , and the global financial environment influences sovereign debt behavior . <p> In Pakistan 's political economic context , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruling class has always feared the public backlash more than the economic costs of default . There are multiple examples from the past when countries like Argentina , Venezuela , Greece , Zimbabwe , Russia , Ecuador , and Peru defaulted mainly due to political mismanagement . <p> On the external front , the structural power of international financial markets has a crucial role in determining our debt repayment decisions . Unlike direct influence through lobbying or coercion , structural power operates by setting the parameters within which states operate . Financial markets , by their ability to provide or withhold credit , can effectively control the economic policy options available to governments . This power is particularly evident in the globalized and financialized world economy . <p> Traditionally , the structural power of creditors was enforced through the fear of spillover costs associated with noncompliance , such as capital flight , higher borrowing costs , and a potential credit embargo . These consequences could severely damage the domestic economy , especially for capital-dependent sectors , which incentivizes compliance . <p> In recent times , enforcement has become stronger due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were largely immune from legal action by foreign creditors . But that immunity has eroded now . <p> Argentina fought a legal battle with its creditors for 14 years . Creditors successfully blocked the Republic of Congo 's oil exports for years , disrupting a multi-billion industry , with lawsuits amounting to 364 million euros against a nominal GDP of 876 million euros in 2009 . The Venezuelan government decided to service bond payments due to litigation risks , despite severe economic conditions . <p> Whether we believe that Pakistan has been able to avoid default due to its own efforts , external assistance or a combination of both , there is no reason to let our guard down . Debt servicing costs are projected to scale up in the next three to four years . Provinces must rise to the challenge of revenue generation and human capital development , complementing the federation 's efforts to rationalize expenses and retire the nation 's obligations gracefully . <p> The writer is an associate research fellow at the Sustainable Development Policy Institute , Islamabad . 
@@113875236 <h> Supreme stakes : the extra judges debate <h> We address the word and see where it leads us <p> ByAli Hassan <p> September 10 , 2024 <p> A general view of the Supreme Court building in Islamabad . -- AFP/File <p> A bill is brought before the Senate by a private member . Increase the cap on Supreme Court judges , it demands . Nay , comes the reply . And as the opposition leader gives his speech , saying clever things here and there , " court stacking " or " packing " -- for puritans -- is what he calls the demand . <p> But that 's the thing with big words -- their usage without context makes for an exercise in fanciful masquerade ; the core is still left untouched . We address the word and see where it leads us . <p> A scholarly definition of court packing reads : " any change of the composition of the existing court , which is irregular , actively driven(non-random) , and creates a new majority or restricts the old one . " <p> Two things : first , the definition stresses the making/ breaking of majorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are and have been divided along ideological lines . In the US , if you are a Republican nominee , you are expected to be ingrained in Republican tradition -- for the dominating Senate would be happy with nothing less than its own make and variant of a judge 's mind . <p> This approach has its backers and detractors but its relevance for us lies exactly in its lack of relevance . With respect , we do not have ideological judges . In fact , putting our political parties in neatly ordained ideology baskets will be a hair-splitting exercise leading to more confusion as more names are thrown in . <p> There may still be the answer that in a Pakistan that does not care about ideologies , judges may simply pander to their political masters : to hell with the ideologies of both . But this is where the definition 's second limb kicks in : a purpose to be served . The purpose however is not conjectural ; the results it yields must be ' immediate ' and the person engaging in packing should be the beneficiary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Menem 's : " Why should I be the only person who wo n't appoint his supreme court " to call anything court packing . <p> This marks the point of contextual departure . Our judicial appointments are not politically led . Per Article 175(A) , there is a committee principally of judges ( Judicial Commission ) where the name of a nominee is raised and debated ; political leanings ( at least , official ones ) come only at the time of ratifying the nominee ( Parliamentary Committee ) , weak as the powers of this committee are . <p> Skip the formals , comes the reply . The chief justice initiates the nomination and then come allegations regarding him . The attorney general and law minister are government men , it is said ; the chief justice may nominate a former judge with similar leanings . The count stops at four ; the majority in the commission still stands the other way : four senior judges and a bar representative . <p> And you and I may argue ad infinitum ; but the fact remains that despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Article 175(A) has not served partisan interests ( mostly ) . Our politicians champion decisions , and not individual judges ( mostly ) -- for was it not the otherwise politicized Bandial court that called the circumvention of the vote of no-confidence what it was : a circumvention ? Even if an individual judge is willing to pander , it is certain that s/he will end up in the minority since there ( mostly ) will be a conscientious majority ruling the other way . <p> To return to the pointed fingers close by , increasing the number of judges from 17 to 21 or 19 to 23 ( if you add ad-hoc judges ) does not carry immediate political ramifications . While one should always steer clear of attributing malice to parliament , the reserved seats order can be discussed within the confines of the Senate Hansard . The judgment is a byproduct , not of an eight-member majority , but a 13-member court . Appealing would require a larger bench -- 14 judges -- and those who have not heard the matter before , which would make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not add up . <p> The opposition minister was portentously throwing in the number seven , even though the presenter and all the other speakers said the increase was six . But I will say no more on numbers so , take a fresh breath and hear this : <p> If the government , even at all , wanted to undo the judgment , it could simply have more ad-hoc judges installed . Even if any malignant government decides to subject some judgments to appeal , it can simply do so by having a small bench hear the matter . But , wait a minute , a judicial committee now decides bench formation and so a weaker judicial-patsy argument can now be made up and we can keep going on in circles . <p> But this academic discussion should stop here ; apprehensions if they are not able to point directly to spectres should be quelled . So , we approach the bill 's content with a fresh mind . <p> Why is there an argument for increasing the number of Supreme Court judges ? We address this by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lower judiciary ; this argument pits the two positions against each other -- and they are not mutually exclusive . More backlog may lie in the lower judiciary but reforming the Supreme Court does not come as a cost to it , and vice versa . Even otherwise , the 50,000 or 60,000 that is being thrown around is the actual Supreme Court backlog . <p> Increasing the number of Supreme Court judges would increase litigation in an already litigiously minded country , runs the second argument . One could also say the same for the lower judiciary ; what is to stop more people from taking their cases before more lower court judges ? This will show us why this argument is misplaced . Clearing the backlog would require more judges ; pacifying a litigious society on the other hand will require a mindset or route shift to ADR and other means of amicable resolution . <p> Then a third one : the Supreme Court should start doing this and that in the future . For sure it should but talks of the future can not be blinded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demands clearance . While the Supreme Court may do well to not adopt future policies that add to it , these arguments help little in addressing the original contention . <p> The bill now lies before the Senate Law and Justice Committee . If the opposition requires that the time for appealing the reserved seats judgment be allowed to pass , or requests that rather than a maximum number be increased , more ad-hoc judges be appointed , or reaches a number in agreement ( two at present ) , the government should facilitate these demands if its intentions are as pure as it projects them to be .

First , the frequent damage to school roofs , whether caused by heavy or light rain , is largely due to negligence on the part of school administrations . Headmasters often fail to take the necessary precautions before the monsoon season . Rooftops are not inspected to ensure proper drainage , and without such basic maintenance , rainwater accumulates , damaging the infrastructure and causing plaster to fall . <p> In addition to negligence , another significant issue is the centralized system of maintenance and repair at the provincial level . The cumbersome processes of procurement and fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Apart from this , there are serious issues related to planning capacity , execution , and time management -- along with questionable intent .

However , only Rs6 billion was released -- and that too towards the end of fiscal year . It defies understanding how the same cycle of poor planning and execution repeats itself year after year , without anyone ever being held accountable . <p> And this is happening in a province where school infrastructure is in desperate need of extensive upgrading and improvement .

Gandapur 's speech targeted not only the government and the establishment but also Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz . In what is rightly being called out by journalist organizations , Gandapur also chose a no-holds-barred attack against journalists critical of the PTI -- also crossing lines of misogyny that ought to concern not just journalist organizations but the PTI leadership itself . <p> This rally , much like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a critical question : where is Pakistan 's politics headed if the PTI refuses to engage in dialogue ? For a party that once prided itself on being a harbinger of ' Naya Pakistan ' , the PTI 's actions now seem to be steering the country toward a dangerous political deadlock . By choosing confrontation over conversation , the PTI risks alienating itself further from the political mainstream . While the rally was a demonstration of strength , it lacked substance in terms of political strategy . The fact is that Imran Khan remains behind bars , and Gandapur 's threats are unlikely to hasten his release . And the uninhibited -- and unwarranted -- attack on journalists is particularly worrying . In a democratic society , the media holds those in power accountable . Branding critical journalists as ' touts ' and making personal attacks will not help anyone . It also reflects poorly not just on one individual but on the party as a whole . <p> In the grander scheme of things , while the party 's core supporters may revel in Gandapur 's bravado , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agenda or secure Imran Khan 's release .

This is a troubling development for the country , which needs stability and cooperation among its political actors more than ever . Politics should be about more than power shows .

Many of these individuals have the potential to achieve greatness on the world stage , just as Haider Ali has , but they are stifled by a lack of resources , training opportunities , and societal support . Schools across the country seldom offer therapy or specialized educational services for students with physical disabilities , leaving many capable children confined to their homes . Haider Ali 's remarkable success should serve as a wake-up call for Pakistan 's policymakers , urging them to create a more inclusive environment for individuals with functional limitations . Too often , Pakistan relies on private organizations and the goodwill of NGOs to fill the gaps in support for people with disabilities . This approach leads to a stark inequality , where children from affluent families have access to resources and training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Paralympics offer a glimpse into how other nations are tackling these challenges . Many countries have made significant strides in creating inclusive policies and infrastructure , enabling their citizens to live with dignity and contribute to society regardless of their physical limitations . Pakistan , however , remains trapped in political distractions , failing to prioritize the needs of its most vulnerable citizens . While officials lament the lack of foreign aid and international support , they ignore opportunities to diversify and launch meaningful projects that could truly change lives . Why not partner with countries and international organizations to develop initiatives that focus on the education and training of children with disabilities ? The Paralympic Games are more than just a sporting event ; they are a platform for individuals who have often felt marginalized or overlooked . They provide an opportunity for people with disabilities to showcase their abilities , proving that they can excel just as much as their able-bodied counterparts .

His unwavering ethical compass serves as a moral centerpiece for the show , often guiding him through complex situations with integrity . His chivalrous attitude takes one back to the timeless ideals of respect and honour . In a cultural landscape often dominated by indifferent male leads , his open acknowledgment of his flaws and insecurities is rather revolutionary . <p> When Mustafa breaks down in front of Sharjeena and shares his raw feelings of being unworthy of her love , the scene resonates deeply with Pakistani women viewers who often only see social displays of male superiority in their everyday lives .

Adeel 's character is a web of deceit and infidelity -- despite marrying money , he harbours fantasies about a life with Sharjeena while simultaneously engaging in an affair with Rubab 's closest friend . His dishonesty extends beyond his infidelity , and he is already seen embezzling funds from Rubab 's business . <p> Irfani brings Adeel 's calculating villainy to life with precision , while Naeema Naeem Butt infuses Rubab 's character with a passionate wickedness that has completely hooked the audience .

Their glamorous malevolence accentuates the genuine struggles and growth of the main couple . <h> Settings , wrist watches , and stolen paintings <p> The narrative of Kabhi Main Kabhi Tum extends far beyond the confines of its episodic structure , with fans eagerly dissecting every aspect of the show 's mise-en-sc ? ne . For example , the space of Mustafa 's room has become a focal point of para-textual discourse in online fan communities about its authenticity within the context of lower-middle-class Pakistani architecture . <p> His room setting has an intricate layout , featuring a box room and another adjoining space that can be best described as a parlour or study .

A notable instance of this is Irfani 's character wearing two wristwatches simultaneously during the infamous search for money scene . This seemingly minor costuming decision has sparked extensive fan theories and discussions , reflecting how even subtle elements can contribute to character construction and audience engagement . <p> Kabhi Main Kabhi Tum has unexpectedly also become entangled in a real-life art mystery . Artist Seffy Soomro recently experienced a shock when he recognised his long-lost paintings prominently featured in an important scene of the show . These artworks , originally part of Soomro 's university thesis , had vanished without a trace after being exhibited at Karachi 's Frere Hall in 2017 .

The show remains steadfast in its commitment to the slow-burn romance at its core , employing classic tropes and beats of the romance genre , and allowing the central relationship to develop organically . With soft stares , meaningful pauses , and simple twirls of joy , the show stays true to its genre roots , offering audiences an unapologetic exploration of love and desire . <p> The show 's dedication to crafting a genuine romantic journey , complete with obstacles , misunderstandings , and moments of connection , demonstrates a nuanced understanding of what makes the romance genre so compelling .

They often made their clothes at home , each group bringing distinct styles and techniques to the table . The Urdu-speaking women were known for their refined stitches , while the Punjabi women brought a different style of embroidery and specific clothing cuts , such as the shalwar . Meanwhile , garments like the gharara , pyjamas and angarkhas became central to the creations of all the women , showcasing the fusion of various cultural influences . <h> " Nobody cuts a gharara quite like our women , " Qureshi proudly says . <h> The crafting focus has been on traditional skills such as stitching and embroidery ; each community brought its unique styles , ensuring the preservation and teaching of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which we still retain and teach today . " Experienced women trained by their grandmothers laid the foundation for this endeavour by imparting their knowledge of classic techniques -- from the intricate art of traditional garment cuts , such as the elegant Delhi cut and the sophisticated Lucknow cut . These techniques , representing centuries of craftsmanship , have been meticulously preserved and are taught to new artisans to ensure their survival . Among the skills imparted was the delicate and labour-intensive craft of smocking , a technique at risk of being lost in the modern age -- a craft that Behbud remains committed to retaining . <h> For the first several decades , Behbud functioned without a structured marketing plan , relying on grassroots efforts and the dedication of its members ; it was only eight years ago that Behbud implemented a formal marketing strategy . This leap into structured marketing has been crucial in expanding Behbud 's reach , ensuring that its mission and products touch the lives of a broader audience . <h> Despite the volunteers ' varied academic backgrounds , many holding Graduate or Master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in running a business . Marketing in particular was uncharted territory . " None of us were trained in fashion design or marketing . Our design ideas often come from everyday observations . We visit stores to see current trends and incorporate that feedback into our products . Our diversity ensures a timeless quality transcending trends . We also produce home linens , reflecting practical , lived experiences from Partition-era members , " says Qureshi . One of their standout offerings , a padded prayer mat , quickly became a niche bestseller . <h> Photo : Behbud Association <h> " Print ads were too expensive , so we focused on grassroots marketing and strategic events . Our first mela ( fair ) was small but successful , leading to larger events . We formalised policies and partnered with event management companies to train our staff and ensure professional publicity . " Their marketing evolved from photocopied flyers to melas and eventually , the Behbud Fiesta , which attracted thousands . " We expanded our visibility through partnerships , like the Habitt kiosk , which helped us reach a broader audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clientele , the Behbud Fiesta has a footfall of thousands , breaking down class divisions , " Qureshi recounts . <h> Embracing the digital age , Qureshi , who belongs to the " Facebook generation , " initiated their Facebook account . " When I joined Behbud , I was perhaps the youngest member at that point , and I was the only one within Behbud who was on Facebook . " Despite initial challenges , this move proved to be a valuable tool for outreach . " From Facebook , we learnt how to manage an Instagram account and today we have a presence on X and LinkedIn . " Currently , Behbud is working on a third website upgrade to enhance user experience , particularly for mobile users . The new website will enable online donations , volunteer sign-ups and include a comprehensive storytelling strategy that highlights not just their history but also their successes . <h> The customer base for Behbud Creations primarily comprises young mothers , women , and professionals looking for competitively priced , high-quality products . These women value affordability without compromising on quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Qureshi , underscoring the rigorous quality control processes that ensure every product meets the high standards set by the Behbud family . <h> Over the years , Behbud has experienced highs and lows , each phase serving as a learning curve . Today , their artisan base extends beyond Karachi and includes skilled workers in areas like Badin who specialise in unique stitching techniques and intricate patchwork . These artisans complement the local in-house artisans and those who work from home . <h> Behbud 's brand philosophy is deeply rooted in leveraging each artisan 's specific skills and pushing them to excel within their capabilities . <h> This inclusive approach ensures that while some women may master certain crafts , others contribute their unique strengths , but nobody gets left behind . <h> The stories of these women are as varied and vibrant as the products they create . For instance , there is the tale of a woman with weak eyesight who only knew how to knit . Despite her limitations , she has been a part of Behbud for 20 years and is now a master blockprinter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inevitable . However , Behbud 's impact goes beyond individual stories . The organisation is a testament to the transformative power of collective efforts . Qureshi summarises this ethos , stating that " our mission is to nurture and empower women . We provide them with opportunities to learn , earn , and grow . Every product we create carries the story of a woman 's journey , her dreams , and her resilience. " 
@@114567233 <p> At the end of last year , Aurora celebrated its 25th anniversary and asked for my contribution . Naturally , I came up with a list of 25 points ( clever , right ? ) that the advertising industry needs to address to get its act together . The Aurora folks then asked me to trim it down to 15 because , apparently , other advertising industry people also needed to say things and sound important . Then , of course , they had to post it on LinkedIn to feel even more important , tagging their entire marketing departments . The marketing departments would then comment , saying " Wow , great work , " and the bosses would reply , and everyone would like that one boss comment of " teamwork , out of the box , creative , etc. , etc . " <p> I 'm rambling . So , back to this . It seems only fitting that I share the remaining 10 with you . Here 's a quick summary : <p> 1 Narratives that Resonate : We have been dishing out stale stories , expecting audiences to feast on them . Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strike a chord . Ones that echo in the heartbeat of the consumer . How ? By diving deep into insights , understanding real emotions , and weaving them with genuine humour . When our storytelling resonates , it does n't just get seen ; it is remembered . It is not just another ad ; it is a conversation starter , a memory maker . That 's how brands become unforgettable . <p> 2 Craft over Crass : Ever seen a campaign that screams louder than my Aunt Rasheeda finding a rat in her kitchen ? That 's crass for you , desperate for attention but clueless on charm . This is what happens when brands opt for noise over nuance . Instead , let 's focus on craft -- creating messages with thoughtfulness and precision . It 's not just about grabbing attention ; it 's about holding it with class and leaving a memorable mark . In a world filled with noise , what stands out is genuine artistry and meaningful connections , not just loud , forgettable stunts . <p> 3 Humour Over Humdrum : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monotony ; where campaigns go to become the wallpaper of consumers ' lives -- pleasantly ignorable . Now , on to humour -- advertising 's knight in shining armour , ready to slay the dragon of dullness . How do we do it ? By letting humour crash the party of predictability , making our campaigns the life of the consumer 's daily scroll . Humour breaks the ice , warms up the audience , and gets the conversation going . It turns brands from faceless corporates to witty companions . Remember Ufone ? There is a reason why we now put RIP before it ... at least I do . And go easy on the moral policing within the boardrooms . Let ideas breathe ! <p> 4 Educate to Elevate : Advertising is not just about selling ; it is about telling . And for that story to be heard and understood , we need an informed audience . It 's like trying to enjoy an opera in a language we do n't speak . The music is nice , but are n't you curious about the drama ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our message clearer ; we make our audience wiser . And a wise audience ? They are the best kind . <p> 5 Social Sensibility , Not Insensitivity : Ah , the allure of jumping on every trending bandwagon , even when it 's headed off a cliff . The ' what ' is about exercising discernment in our social messaging . The ' how ' is by developing an understanding of social undercurrents , ensuring our messages uplift rather than offend . And the ' why ' ? Because in the age of cancel culture , a misstep is not just a stumble ; it is a nosedive into the abyss of public disdain . Go read my review of McDonald 's last film on ' inclusion ' ... we really did n't need to boycott them . They were just two more ads away from being cancelled anyway . <p> 6 Kick Stereotypes to the Curb : The advertising world has been a breeding ground for stereotypes for too long . It 's time we kick these outdated clich ? s to the curb . Dismantle the stereotypes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our campaigns . Why ? Because breaking free from stereotypes not only fosters a more positive societal impact , it paves the way for original and relatable advertising content . <p> 7 Feedback as Feedforward : You know those people who hear feedback and act like they have bitten into a sour lemon ? Yeah , we need less of that in advertising . Think of feedback as GPS directions -- sometimes it reroutes you , but it is just trying to save you from a traffic jam . So , instead of sulking , let 's use it to fuel our next creative pit stop . Constructive criticism is just a mentor you have n't thanked yet . <p> 8 ROI -- Relevance Over Impressions : Every year , as I leaf through the Effie cases , I 'm struck by a glaring oversight in our industry 's approach to ROI . We are obsessed with surface-level metrics , touting media results and sales figures as the ultimate proof of a campaign 's success . But here 's the real talk : not every campaign is laser-focused on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showcasing media prowess . The real ' return ' we should be chasing is not numbers on a spreadsheet . It 's about cultural relevance ; how a brand embeds itself in societal conversations , resonates with its audience , and how each campaign amplifies that brand 's voice in the larger narrative . <p> 9 Purpose Over Popularity : In the glitzy world of likes , shares , and fleeting viral moments , it 's easy to get sidetracked by the siren call of popularity . But here 's the twist . Popularity is like that high school crush , thrilling for a moment but fleeting . The purpose is the soulmate that gives a brand depth and direction . When we anchor campaigns with genuine purpose , we create legacies , not trends . So , while chasing the viral dragon may give a quick high , it 's the purpose-driven narrative that stands the test of time . Do n't just be the talk of the town ; be its heartbeat . <p> 10 Collaborate , Do n't Dictate : In the ad world , everyone 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard . But there is always that one insecure boss , acting like he is holding the only golden ticket to ' Creativity Land ' . Newsflash : Just because you have tenure does n't mean you have cornered the market on ideas . Time to share the stage , big guy . Your insecurities ? They are showing . And they ai n't a good look . Let others shine too . We have all got hits to drop . Why ? Because diversity of thought is n't just trendy -- it 's the lifeblood of ground-breaking campaigns . When more voices join the chorus , the song is richer . <p> So here it is , folks -- my little list of how we can make things better . Maybe you will agree , maybe you wo n't . But this is n't about me or you . It 's about the bigger picture . We need to unite and take steps to make it work for us and our industry . For the awards we desperately want but do n't need , and to rise above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

Last evening she had found a note at the Post Office counter with the words , " Please help me ! " <p> She looked around at the clamour of messages being dropped and picked by pigeons .

He took out the first note from his desk and kept it beside the latest note . <p> " It 's the same handwriting . And there are spelling errors . It means it 's been written by someone very young , perhaps uneducated ... , " the rooster pronounced thoughtfully . " My instinct says that this is a genuine plea for help , " said Dazel . <p> " Why do you think this creature is not asking for help directly ? " asked the rooster . " Maybe he or she is afraid ?

Its beady eyes seemed to dart around furtively and it quickly took out a folded banana leaf from under its wing and put it on the Post Office counter . <p> " Hey , " Dazel yelled as she flew out from behind the building . " Wait ! Why do you need help ? The bird stopped dead in its tracks . It flapped its wings as if to fly away . <p> " Please , do n't fly away , " pleaded Dazel . " I will try to help you .

But I want to learn new things , " Theo said . His words came pouring out as if a dam had been broken . <p> " Come , I will take you to Wiz Rooster . He will speak to your mother , " assured Dazel . " Come with me , " and with those words Dazel motioned Theo to follow her . They flew directly to Wiz Rooster 's office at the Aviary School . Panting , Dazel told the whole story to the rooster who was listening carefully . Finally , Wiz spoke , " I know your mother . She is a hard nut to crack . It will take some convincing to melt her heart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to your home . " <p> Theo seemed speechless . " My mother will be furious with me if she finds out that I asked for help .

Long stretches of water with muddy banks stretched before them , surrounded by cypress trees . Dazel had been there before and recalled a nasty experience with the Venus Flytraps -- the meat-eating plants -- which grew there . She shuddered at the memory . <p> The wetlands were a dark and dank place . Dazel spotted Theo near one cup-shaped nest perched on a cypress tree .

Tyra looked at them in anger . " I am their mother and I will decide . " <p> " Education is a basic right of all the creatures of D'Land .

These laws aim to ensure fair treatment , reasonable rent increases , and safe living conditions .

This is to prevent excessive deposits that could be difficult for tenants to recover . <p> Interest on Deposits : In some cases , landlords may be required to pay interest on the security deposit . <h> Maintenance and Repairs <p> Landlord 's Responsibility : Landlords are generally responsible for maintaining the property in a habitable condition . This includes repairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common areas . <p> Tenant 's Obligations : While landlords are responsible for major repairs , tenants may be responsible for minor repairs or damages caused by their negligence . <h> Eviction Protections <p> Just Cause : Landlords can not evict tenants without a valid reason , such as non-payment of rent , violation of lease terms , or illegal activity . <p> Notice Period : Landlords must provide tenants with a specified notice period before eviction . This allows tenants time to find alternative housing . <h> Harassment and Discrimination <p> Prohibition : Laws prohibit landlords from harassing or discriminating against tenants based on factors such as race , religion , gender , or disability . <h> Specific Laws and Regulations <p> While the general principles outlined above are common , the specific laws and regulations may vary from province to province in Pakistan .

@@115567235 <h> Gandapur claimed he was safely in KP House -- curiously evading notice of Rangers and Islamabad Police <p> In a bizarre political theatre , Khyber Pakhtunkhwa 's Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur reappeared in the KP Assembly on Sunday , a day after being declared a ' missing person ' by his own party . This came on the heels of a resolution passed for his recovery , sparking more confusion than resolution . Gandapur claimed he was safely in KP House all along -- curiously evading the notice of the Rangers and Islamabad Police . Yet , the real question is whether the PTI misled the public about his alleged ' disappearance ' or simply lost control of its narrative . While some argue he was ' lying low ' , the party 's failure to reach Gandapur led to an unwarranted frenzy , fueling speculation of a pre-arranged meeting with powerful figures .

With the Shanghai Cooperation Organization ( SCO ) moot around the corner and the nation grappling with escalating security threats , the PTI 's actions are raising serious questions about its priorities .

One could argue that PTI 's aim is to pressure the powers into a dialogue , but its erratic actions may have the opposite effect .

If the party continues down this path of reckless leadership and disregard for its grassroots , it risks not only losing the trust of its own people but also its relevance in the political landscape . The point is that Gandapur 's resurfacing and the chaos surrounding it is a microcosm of a larger problem within the PTI : a party adrift , where the leadership is more concerned with political gamesmanship than the well-being of its supporters or the stability of the country . Political movements require sacrifice and strategy , but they also require responsibility -- a lesson the PTI seems to have forgotten .

@@115686230 <h> Far beyond the edge of reason <p> Bridget was once a relatable breath of fresh air , but the time has come to lay her escapades to rest . Photo : File <p> SLOUGH , ENGLAND : <p> Are you brave enough to peer down the bottomless pit of cash-grab sequels popping out of Hollywood ? Then kick aside the detritus of Joker 2 and Inside Out 2 and make way for Mad About The Boy , also known as Bridget Jones 4 . <p> Based on the 2013 novel of the same name , come February next year , Ren ? e Zellweger will be back as the chaotic Bridget , alongside Hugh Grant as the abominable Daniel Cleaver . She who can do no wrong , Emma Thompson - who played Bridget 's obstetrician in the third Bridget film - is also slated for a return as series author Helen Fielding whips up a script for yet another weary addition to the franchise . <p> For those who indulge in the on-screen activities of Britain 's most ditzy blonde just to have a chance to ogle at Colin Firth , prepare for abject disappointment . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though he may be to play a Darcy in some form or another , Firth 's character and Bridget 's true love , Mark Darcy , has been definitively disposed of via a landmine in Sudan . If you are looking for someone to blame , look no further than Fielding , who conjured up this tragic landmine-based incident to avoid her heroine becoming a " smug married " . ( It appears that the only surefire way to escape such a dreadful fate is to involve a faraway landmine , rather than to avoid engaging in wedded bliss in the first place . ) Is there any point , then , in exploring Bridget 's life any further ? <p> The short answer is , no . This is a sequel . There is rarely any good reason for one . If , however , your definition of a " point " is " mindless escapism " then by all means strap in . <p> A quick recap <p> Based on the world 's original chick-lit , Jane Austen 's Pride and Prejudice ( it is no coincidence that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is played by Firth ) , Bridget Jones 's Diary ( 2001 ) was a breath of fresh air . Zellweger fooled everyone into believing she really was English as Bridget stumbled through her life trying to lose weight , fall in love , keep a job , and generally careen from one disaster to another . In any land containing women , there would be someone who would find her struggles relatable , regardless of cultural background . <p> For a start , here was a heroine who did not have ballerina legs . I can not stress this point enough . I have endured enough chick-lit to know that when Bridget Jones 's Diary was published in 1996 , it was almost mandatory for all rom-com heroines to possess the body shape of ballerinas , even if the text showed that they had the workout habits of a nesting pigeon . To see both the book and the film version of Bridget look like an actual person , therefore , was almost more gratifying than seeing Firth roped into playing a Darcy . <p> Not only does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she also craves the presence of a special someone in her life , swinging between the rakish but vile Daniel Cleaver and the sensible but stodgy Mark Darcy . Her approach to life may be somewhat unorthodox , but there will be enough Pakistani ladies burned by the rishta process to at least get an inkling into Bridget 's desire to be chosen by a man , however uncool such a notion may sound . So far , so good . <p> A series of sequels <p> Tread with caution , for here lie spoilers galore . The second film , Edge of Reason ( 2004 ) , based loosely on yet another Austen novel , Persuasion , sees Bridget 's chaotic life take her further afield to Thailand . Here she learns that Daniel is as much of an empty-headed womaniser as he ever was . Still reeling from this unsettling ( but rather obvious ) discovery , Bridget ends up being inadvertently imprisoned . During her stint in Thai jail , Bridget somehow finds the will to serenade her fellow inmates with a rousing rendition of Madonna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Daniel end up fighting like a pair of testosterone-fuelled schoolboys . Entertaining , certainly . But does it pack the relatable punch of the first film ? No . <p> The third film , Bridget Jones 's Baby , finds Bridget in the enviable situation where she has both Mark and Jack ( played by none other than TV 's dreamiest doctor , Patrick Dempsey ) fighting for her affections . Daniel is presumed dead in a plane crash , but as is common with fictional plane crash victims , he turns up very much alive by the end of the film . Entertaining , but inevitably , pointless . <p> Back to the present <p> The fourth film will see Bridget navigating her fifties minus a husband as she grapples with loss , motherhood , dating apps and " reuniting with an old flame " , who , according to the balance of probability , must surely be none other than Daniel . <p> " So we did n't have a 60-year-old Daniel Cleaver wandering around looking at young girls . I made up a good interim story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Graham Norton Show . At this stage , we do not know just what this good interim story consists of , nor how closely the film will follow the book . Whatever path it takes , Grant is convinced we will not be disappointed . " It is a good and moving script , " he said . " It is extremely funny but very sad . " <p> Regardless of how funny or sad it may be , however , there are those who feel that nothing encapsulates the term " flogging a dead horse " better than the Bridget Jones series . " When I heard the news that a fourth instalment of Bridget Jones was due to start filming this spring , my first thought was : oh , dear God , please no more , " writes Emily Bootle for iNews . " Bridget made so many of us who we are - and that means not only that we do n't want her to change , but that her shenanigans are no longer revolutionary . " <p> Chick-lit lovers in my own reading circle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were younger , but now it is something I would only watch when I 'm brain dead , " confesses Sudashni Sayana , whose Bridget days are numbered . <p> A wise book editor once told me that audiences are not interested in real life . They want high-octane drama that pings off in a wildly different direction to real life . Sometimes , however , that direction is so far off into the horizon that it is nothing but a vanishing dot . Bridget may not quite deserve the landmine that finished off her beloved Mark , but perhaps it would n't be the worst thing in the world if she took up crocheting far away from the screen to spin out the rest of her days .

The urgency of this discussion is highlighted by the staggering backlog of cases in our judicial system , with around 0.4 million pending across superior courts , including approximately 60,000 in the Supreme Court alone . Establishing a Federal Constitutional Court could provide a critical framework to address these pressing challenges and ensure a more effective judicial process that prioritizes the needs of all citizens . <p> The need for a specialized court dedicated solely to constitutional matters has never been clearer .

Initially pursued by my father , I have taken on the responsibility of following it up for the last three years after his passing , yet still , there is no resolution in sight . <p> A recent Supreme Court case involving a widow highlights the critical situation many face within our judicial system . The Supreme Court of Pakistan has mandated the immediate transfer of her inherited property after a staggering 26 years of protracted litigation . This distressing example underscores the urgent need for the Supreme Court to prioritize pressing civil matters rather than becoming mired in constitutional disputes . <p> Such cases -- like this widow 's plight -- emphasize the kind of justice that should be at the forefront of our courts . They illustrate the critical issues affecting ordinary citizens , whose lives are often disrupted by lengthy legal battles . Instead of enduring years of uncertainty and anguish , individuals deserve swift and fair resolutions . Let 's not forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ali Bhutto to attain justice . This painful delay underscores the urgent need for a judicial system that delivers swift and fair resolutions for all Pakistanis . <p> The current leadership of the PPP , under Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari , is actively addressing the establishment of the Federal Constitutional Court with a hands-on approach . He is not only overseeing these reform efforts personally but is also engaging directly with bar associations , media outlets , and various stakeholders in the legal community to foster meaningful change . Our party is committed to consensus politics , striving to ensure that every voice is heard and that the parliamentary process is open and transparent . This inclusive strategy aims to bring all stakeholders together , reflecting the true will of the people and creating a more responsive and accountable judicial system . <p> The establishment of the Federal Constitutional Court should not be perceived as an attack on the independence of the higher judiciary ; rather , it should be viewed as a constructive measure aimed at strengthening it . This initiative is designed to enhance the judicial system , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the people of Pakistan . By creating a specialized court to handle constitutional matters , we can empower the Supreme Court to focus on critical civil and criminal cases that have a direct impact on citizens ' lives , ensuring that justice is both accessible and timely . <p> A core part of these reforms is the proposal that judges be appointed by parliament rather than through internal judicial processes . This change would ensure greater accountability and representation within the judiciary , moving away from a system that often prioritizes the interests of the legal elite over the general public . By allowing parliamentary appointments , we can align our judicial system more closely with democratic principles and public accountability . <p> Imagine a Federal Constitutional Court that focuses solely on constitutional issues , efficiently resolving them and alleviating the heavy backlog in the Supreme Court . Such a court would have the authority to adjudicate disputes between provincial and federal governments , as well as to enforce fundamental rights in matters of public importance . If the 26th Amendment is passed , it could empower not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providing a neutral platform to resolve constitutional disputes . This court would be characterized by equal representation from all provinces , thereby strengthening interprovincial trust and reinforcing our currently fragile federal structure . <p> The proposed new Judicial Commission , responsible for appointing and monitoring judges , would be chaired by the chief justice of the Federal Constitutional Court ( FCC ) , along with its two senior-most judges , the chief justice of the Supreme Court , its two senior-most judges , four parliamentarians , the federal law minister , the attorney general of Pakistan , and a senior advocate of the Supreme Court . An eight-member committee from the National Assembly , selected through proportional representation of all parties , would nominate the chief justices of the Supreme Court and FCC . <p> The Judicial Commission would evaluate judges ' performance and efficiency , with the authority to recommend their removal to the Supreme Judicial Council . As envisioned in the Charter of Democracy , all appeals arising under Article 199 from provincial high courts would be directed to the FCC . This would allow the Supreme Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most critical issues affecting citizens ' rights receive the attention they deserve . <p> Looking globally , we can draw inspiration from countries successfully implementing specialized constitutional courts . The Constitutional Court of South Africa has played an essential role in promoting democracy and protecting human rights by focusing solely on constitutional issues . Similarly , Indonesia 's Constitutional Court ( Mahkamah Konstitusi ) is dedicated to ensuring that laws conform to the constitution , and plays a vital role in electoral matters . These examples illustrate the numerous advantages of having a dedicated court for constitutional issues , boosting both judicial efficiency and public trust . <p> Seventy-seven countries have established separate constitutional courts specifically to handle complex constitutional issues . This not only streamlines the judicial process but also alleviates the workload on the Supreme Court , allowing it to focus more on criminal and civil cases . This division of responsibilities ensures a more efficient legal system and enhances the capacity for handling specialized constitutional matters . <p> Today , we stand at a crucial crossroads in Pakistan 's history . The establishment of a Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landscape . This is n't just another bureaucratic change ; it 's essential for restoring public trust and ensuring justice is both accessible and efficient . <p> Our elected representatives must translate their commitment to a balanced judicial system into real action . By pursuing these reforms , we can enhance the rule of law , safeguard rights , and amplify every Pakistani 's voice . This is not merely an aspiration but an obligation to ourselves and future generations . The time for action is now . 
@@115796231 <h> Judicial reforms or executive control ? <h> Most immediate issue with these reforms is that they do not correctly identify causes of delay in judicial system <p> ByJahanzeb Sukhera <p> October 11 , 2024 <p> The Supreme Court of Pakistan building in Islamabad . -- AFP/File <p> It is hardly a secret that the current political flux the country is in relates to the proposed constitutional amendment . The contours of the amendment are unclear but what can be gleaned from the statements of the ruling parties and other quarters is that they shall contain certain changes to Pakistan 's judicial structure . <p> The original draft that appeared in the public sphere , and talk thereafter , suggests that changes envisioned include the formation of a ' Federal Constitutional Court ' which will hear and decide constitutional matters either filed directly before it or as appeals arising from constitutional petitions filed at the high courts . <p> Other appeals would be left within the domain of the Supreme Court . It is understood that the Federal Constitutional Court shall have superior authority as compared to the Supreme Court , in so far as it decides the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change is necessitated as the Supreme Court is unable to decide regular civil and criminal appeals owing to the burden of constitutional cases pending before it . <p> It is being envisioned that the government and the legislative would have a determining role in the appointments and removal of all judges of superior judiciary , including the Federal Constitutional Court . Furthermore , the executive and legislative branches would have greater control over the functioning of the high courts as they would reserve for themselves the power to transfer judges between high courts and to also remove them based on yearly performance reviews . <p> If these amendments are viewed through a lens that enables the seer to see only bona fides , then the purpose of these amendments appears to be the rebalancing of the capability and capacity of the judiciary to judicially review executive actions and to limit its ability to affect the formation and stability of governments . <p> There are some strong merits in wanting to achieve these objectives . After all , these governments are elected to carry out the electorate 's mandate , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influences government-making . However , some pitfalls need to be addressed and catered for in this endeavor to reform the judiciary . <p> The most immediate issue with these reforms is that they do not correctly identify the causes of delay in the judicial system . For most kinds of cases , pendency at the Supreme Court accounts for only about a fourth of their lifetime . Most of the delay is occasioned by adjournments at this court of first instance , which is ordinarily the civil court or court of the magistrate . <p> Ordinarily , a civil case will take three to five years to be decided by a civil court . Thereafter , each appeal will take between a year and a half to two years . Often interlocutory matters such as the framing of issues or production of evidence will give rise to appeals . When this happens , the appeals will be decided according to a similar timeframe , and while they are being decided the trial comes to a standstill , only to begin again after the appeals are finally decided by the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amendments do not cater for or address the more substantial reason for delay . Unless these delays are managed somehow , the constitutional amendments in so far as they purport to streamline the system shall remain unsuccessful . In any case , the issue of delay relates to the civil and criminal procedure laws , the amendment of which does not require changes in the constitution . <p> One of the aspects in which the judicial system works with comparative efficiency is the writ jurisdiction exercised by the high courts . In this jurisdiction , the high courts hear and decide matters where petitioners challenge the acts of government or legislature for being more than their legal or constitutional bounds , as the case may be . <p> One can expect immediate relief from such illegal state action in the form of injunctions . These cases and their appeals are also often finally decided within six years approximately . The proposed amendments , however , threaten to make this jurisdiction ineffective , thereby damaging a part of the judicial structure , which is functioning relatively better . <p> If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from one high court to another and remove them on the basis of yearly uprises , it is likely that the judges will be mindful of this consideration when deciding cases against the government or the legislature . Understandably , a judge hearing cases in Lahore may be wary of passing orders that may result in him finding himself hearing cases in Turbat . <p> Another angle to look at this issue is that the litigant will also decide to not seek judicial review of the executive or legislative actions if the final court to which that matter shall be appealed is manned according to the discretion of the government . It would be a fair perception that the Federal Constitutional Court , whose judges are appointed and may be removed by the government , is unlikely to render decisions that may antagonize the government . <p> No person who has experienced the judicial system can deny that it requires a complete overhaul . The system does not work for the ordinary litigant . It is so inefficient that even if a matter is decided in favour of a litigant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final decision is then of no use or significance . <p> One can not fault a litigant when s/he feels that the legal costs endured to obtain a judgment were a bad investment . The more worrying concern is that when there is no state-sanctioned dispute resolution mechanism in which an ordinary citizen can find recourse , s/he is likely to resolve his disputes out of court , and oftentimes times this resolution will entail violence . It should also not be forgotten that one of the reasons why the TTP found support in certain regions was that they offered a swift and effective dispute-resolution mechanism . <p> It is imperative that the judicial system be fixed . However , the judicial reforms proposed through the constitutional amendments do not appear to do so . With the information available , it is hard to view them as anything but a recalibration of the three branches of the state -- for the benefit of those who seek power and control over the state .

The international media is rightly marking it as a breakthrough in bilateral ties between New Delhi and Islamabad . <p> The visit will be the first by an Indian foreign minister to Pakistan in nearly a decade , as Sushma Swaraj ( late ) was the last Indian foreign minister who visited Pakistan in 2015 . I still remember that Sushma-ji showed special interest when I conveyed the peace message to her during my visit to India . Unfortunately , after her death , bilateral relations became tense day by day . <p> Confirmation of India 's participation in the SCO Summit has also intensified the ongoing discussion in the media about whether the arrival of the Indian delegate in Islamabad will lead to ice melting between two neighbouring countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari participated in the SCO foreign ministers meeting held in Goa . <p> Currently , Pakistan is facing serious challenges at the internal level .

Anti-state militants , on the other hand , have started to sabotage law and order at the behest of external powers . International analysts are therefore terming the current situation of Pakistan as a perfect storm -- the country forced to face challenges emerging from different sides simultaneously . <p> In my view , Pakistan and India are two unique countries on the world map that not only share a common history of thousands of years but also their present and future are connected . There is a dire need for India to find a peaceful solution to resolve the conflicts amicably .

At present , the eyes of millions of peace-loving people living in Pakistan and India are focused on the Shanghai Cooperation Organization ( SC ) ) .

Although these amendments were shelved in September , the Pakistan People 's Party ( PPP ) has taken the lead in rallying stakeholders around the FCC , with Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari asserting that the court is essential to address provincial disparities . The PPP insists that this initiative aligns with the 2006 Charter of Democracy ( CoD ) , emphasizing that broad consensus , similar to that achieved with the 18th Amendment , is necessary . There is merit in the PPP 's call for consensus , as judicial reforms should not be introduced without wide consultation and debate . The need for reform , particularly in Pakistan 's judiciary , is evident . The legacy of unchecked judicial power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governance . For the PPP , which has long suffered at the hands of judicial overreach , establishing a constitutional court is seen as a necessary check on judicial interference in parliamentary matters . <p> Observers note that this is a rare instance where the PPP has taken full ownership of an issue , indicating its deep-seated concern with the judiciary 's overreach . For decades , the judiciary has resisted parliamentary oversight in appointments , fueling the PPP 's determination to introduce checks and balances . However , while the judiciary 's past interventions in democratic processes demand scrutiny , any effort to curtail its powers must be carefully considered and not rushed . The petitions filed in courts calling for a public debate on the amendments reflect a growing concern about transparency . These petitions raise an important question : should such significant legislation be pushed through without public scrutiny ? The answer is no . Constitutional amendments , which require a two-thirds majority , must be openly debated to ensure transparency and avoid perceptions of a political power grab . The opacity surrounding the draft amendments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has only added to suspicions that the amendments are aimed at weakening the Supreme Court and curbing the powers of the chief justice of Pakistan ( CJP ) . <p> Critics argue that these amendments are a veiled attempt to strip the Supreme Court of its authority , particularly in matters of democratic oversight . Supporters within the government claim that the reforms will prevent the judiciary from playing a ' negative role ' in democratic processes . Both perspectives hold weight , but the lack of clarity surrounding the amendments only fuels further mistrust . The PPP 's push for the FCC underscores its longstanding grievances with the judiciary -- but meaningful reform can not come from haphazard efforts . Pakistan 's judiciary is in need of reform , but the solution must be comprehensive , transparent , and free from political manipulation . The proposed draft should be made public immediately , allowing for a full and open debate before it is presented to parliament .

Officially established in 2011 , the day aims to highlight the need to address the challenges girls face and to promote girls ' empowerment and the fulfilment of their human rights . Sadly , this is an aim that many countries , particularly those in the Global South , are failing to achieve . According to UN data , nearly 20 per cent of all girls worldwide are still not completing lower-secondary school and almost twice as many are not completing upper-secondary school . Meanwhile , a Unicef report has found that more than 370 million girls and women alive today , or one in every eight worldwide , experienced rape or sexual assault before the age of 18 . This number rises to a shocking one in five when taking into account ' non-contact ' forms of sexual violence , such as online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also shows that girls are lagging when it comes to access to new technologies , with an estimated 90 per cent of adolescent girls and young women not using the internet in low-income countries . The exposure to sexual violence and abuse online likely has something to do with this problem , along with the fact that many girls still have to bear the blame for this sort of abuse . This usually results in them losing access to something or another . <p> These figures are a searing indictment of global efforts to ensure equality for women , which begins with ensuring that girls have the opportunities and protection they deserve and are not excluded from society because of their gender . Failing to tackle discrimination and exclusion of girls ultimately results in women having a more diminished role and voice in society , which keeps renewing the cycle of neglect and disparity . In Pakistan , an estimated 53 per cent of the over 25 million out-of-school children are girls , which has resulted in a labour force where women are disproportionately underrepresented . The female labour participation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as compared to around 80 per cent of men and the gap is particularly acute at the top of the economic pyramid with women making up a mere 5.71 per cent of legislators , senior officials and managers as per the World Economic Forum 's Global Gender Gap Report . <p> For young girls growing up in Pakistan , there are few women in power whom they can look up to and count on to protect their rights . The lack of women in the workforce also undermines girls ' access to critical services such as healthcare and education , given that girls are more likely to feel comfortable in these environments when women are present . This makes evident the cyclical nature of gender exclusion . And while gender gaps in Pakistan have actually slightly narrowed and the nation has passed new bills to address issues like sexual harassment and domestic violence , it is clear that the progress has been too slow and what laws the country does have are not being implemented as well as they should be . Much the same can be said about other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women and girls on paper can only achieve so much and has to be backed by efforts to increase their presence in education , the digital sphere , media , workplaces , and top leadership positions .

However , the most effective time to intervene is during the breeding season , which begins with the early monsoon rains .

Once mosquitoes reach adulthood , they become much harder to control , hiding in hard-to-reach areas and developing increasing resistance to commonly used insecticides , which are often applied without adhering to proper guidelines . <p> The reported dengue data only reflects cases that reach hospitals .

@@116033235 <p> Reuters is an international news organisation owned by Thomson Reuters <p> Regular-looking pagers delivered to Hezbollah at the beginning of 2024 were , in fact , cleverly concealed bombs . This operation , suspected to be orchestrated by Israel , aimed to cripple the Lebanese group . <p> According to a detailed report by Reuters journalists , the pagers ' batteries held a small but potent charge of plastic explosive . A novel detonator , invisible to X-ray scanners , was also incorporated into the design according to a Lebanese source with firsthand knowledge and teardown photos reviewed by Reuters . <p> Creating a Believable Cover Story <p> To address the weakness of having no established background for this bulky new product , Israeli agents crafted fake online stores , webpages , and posts designed to deceive Hezbollah 's security checks . A Reuters examination of archived web data confirms this elaborate deception . <p> Unprecedented Blow to Hezbollah <p> This meticulously planned operation , with its stealthy pager bomb design and the battery 's carefully constructed cover story , sheds light on the years-long effort that dealt a heavy blow to Israel 's Iranian-backed foe in Lebanon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a full-blown war . <p> Dissecting the Deceptive Battery <p> The seemingly ordinary pager battery held a dark secret . A thin sheet of PETN plastic explosive ( six grams ) was squeezed between two rectangular lithium-ion cells , according to the Lebanese source and photos . The remaining space housed a highly flammable strip that triggered detonation . This three-layer " sandwich " was then encased in a black plastic sleeve and a metal shell , roughly the size of a matchbox . <p> A key aspect of the design was the absence of a standard metallic detonator . This , along with the plastic explosives , made the device invisible to X-ray scans . <p> Hezbollah Unaware of the Threat <p> Upon receiving the pagers in February , Hezbollah conducted standard security checks , including running them through airport scanners . Alarmingly , nothing suspicious was detected . The devices were likely designed to generate a spark within the battery pack , igniting the flammable material and detonating the PETN explosives , as explained by bomb experts who reviewed the pager bomb design . <p> The bulky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their casing took up about a third of the volume , significantly reducing the battery 's power capacity . Battery experts noted this discrepancy , highlighting a substantial amount of unexplained weight in the battery pack . <p> The Pagers Explode <p> Despite noticing the shorter-than-expected battery life , Hezbollah did not raise major security concerns . Tragically , just hours before the attack , they were still distributing the pagers to their members . <p> On September 17th , thousands of pagers detonated simultaneously across Hezbollah strongholds , including the southern suburbs of Beirut . The explosions typically occurred after the devices beeped , indicating an incoming message . The close proximity of victims to the pagers at the time of detonation was evident from the injuries sustained -- eye injuries , missing fingers , and severe abdominal wounds -- witnessed by Reuters reporters at hospitals . The combined death toll from the pager attack and a subsequent attack using weaponized walkie-talkies the following day reached 39 , with over 3,400 wounded . <p> Mossad Suspected , Israel Silent <p> Two Western security sources pointed to the Israeli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pager and walkie-talkie attacks . The origin of the devices remains unclear . Neither Israel 's Prime Minister 's office nor Lebanon 's Information Ministry or Hezbollah spokespersons commented on the matter for this article . Israel has maintained silence on its involvement , although comments by Israel 's Defense Minister praising Mossad 's " very impressive " results were widely interpreted as an implicit acknowledgment of their participation . U.S. officials reportedly had no prior knowledge of the operation . <p> The Weak Link : A Non-Existent Product <p> While the pager 's power source resembled a standard lithium-ion battery used in various electronic devices , there was a crucial detail -- the battery , labeled LI-BT783 , simply did not exist commercially . <p> Creating a Legend for the Pagers <p> To overcome this hurdle , Israeli agents fabricated a complete backstory . Hezbollah is known for its rigorous procurement procedures , and the agents ensured that if Hezbollah investigated , they would find something seemingly legitimate . This practice of creating fabricated identities or " legends " for undercover operatives is a well-established tactic in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application of these techniques to a seemingly ordinary consumer product . <p> Gold Apollo -- Unknowingly Involved ? <p> The agents used a fake model , the AR-924 pager , to deceive Hezbollah . This custom-designed pager was sold under the brand name of a reputable Taiwanese company . <p> Gold Apollo 's chairman , Hsu Ching-kuang , told reporters a day after the pager attack that he was approached about three years ago by a former employee , Teresa Wu , and her " big boss , called Tom " to discuss a licence agreement . <p> Hsu said he had scant information about Wu 's superior , but he granted them the right to design their own products and market them under the widely distributed Gold Apollo brand . Reuters could not establish the identity of the manager , nor whether the person or Wu knowingly worked with Israeli intelligence . <p> The chairman said he was not impressed by the AR-924 when he saw it , but still added photos and a description of the product to his company 's website , helping give it both visibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the AR-924 from his website . <p> Hsu said he knew nothing about the pagers ' lethal capabilities or the broader operation to attack Hezbollah . He described his company as a victim of the plot . <p> Gold Apollo declined to provide further comment . Calls and messages sent to Wu went unanswered . She has not given a statement to the media since the attacks . <h> ' I know this product ' <p> In September 2023 , webpages and images featuring the AR-924 and its battery were added to apollosystemshk.com , a website that said it had a licence to distribute Gold Apollo products , as well as the rugged pager and its bulky power source , according to a Reuters review of internet records and metadata . <p> The website gave an address in Hong Kong for a company called Apollo Systems HK .

@@116205234 <p> Many people think of self-love as selfishness , but there is a huge difference .

Unfortunately , the biggest problem today is that people are busy in trying to please and impress others . We prioritise other people 's preferences over our own , and that 's why we want to dress in a way that others will appreciate , rather than what we feel comfortable in . We want to do what others approve of , rather than following our own passion . And in doing all this , we are not practicing self-love .

If he had focused on trying to become a cricketer , like most youngsters in our country want to , because it is the most popular sport here , he would not have made it so big . But he did what he was interested in and so succeeded . <p> Similarly , we should all stop caring about what people would say , instead we should focus on our passion , because it is not possible to fully satisfy everyone .

When he moved ahead , some other people saw him and laughed at him , saying how foolish a person he was , despite having a donkey , he has carried all the stuff himself and was not riding on the donkey . <p> This story was meant to show that satisfying people only wastes your time and energy , for they will always have something to complain about , no matter what you do . It is wiser to stop trying to meet other people 's expectations , and focus on your own needs and dreams . <p> Believe me , life becomes very peaceful when we stop caring about people and start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digest too much food , in the same way , too much love can not be digested by anyone . This is why when we give more love to someone , we become valueless in their eyes .

Until we understand our own worth , others will never value us and will always take us for granted . <p> Accept yourself the way you are , because no one is inferior . We all are created by the same God and we all have some God-gifted talent within us , we just need to explore it . And in order to explore that , it is necessary to love and understand yourself , otherwise you will think of yourself as worthless , even if you have some special talent within you .

In the same way , the more you believe in yourself , the more challenges you will be able to face with success . <p> Self-love teaches us that just as it is wrong to hurt others , it is also wrong to hurt ourselves and we hurt ourselves by hating someone or being angry at someone . The bitterness we carry for someone is first tasted by us , for it lies within us , with sometimes the other person not even knowing what we feel . So do n't hate or be so angry with others that it ruins your own peace of mind and you suffer as a result . <p> Retribution is real . As we sow , so shall we reap . So instead of being angry at someone , forgive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have peace of mind , you are the richest person in the world . <p> Some of the most common complaints that people have about life are why others hurt and ignore them , why people do n't value them even when they treat others well .

And the person who learns the skill to be happy alone does not need anyone . No one can make such a person sad and no one can make him or her cry . <p> You do n't need to have a lot of money to be happy , but you need to love your life , and to do that , you must have self-love . Then you will enjoy your own company without the need to be appreciated and valued by others .

And farmers are rightly cautioning that the uncertainty about the government 's position could cause wheat sowing area to shrink significantly in the upcoming Rabi season . <p> The government is clearly caught in a catch-22 . The IMF does not care how it balances the equation as long as it does not directly interfere with the market mechanism .

A similar dilemma faces cotton farmers , who are also upset by the government 's silence about the support price even this late in the day , forcing textile exporters to resort to frantic imports at top dollar . <p> Managing wheat production is not just about the budget ; it is also the country 's staple diet .

Iran has moved the International Court of Arbitration in Paris against Pakistan for not completing its portion of the gas pipeline and failure to have an intake of 750 mmcfd gas under the Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline . In turn , the government of Pakistan has hired the services of three reputed global law firms to fight its case in the global arbitration court . <p> This is an unfortunate development , which would not only cost both the nations significantly in terms of fees of lawyers and court , but would also affect the bilateral relationship between them . <p> The two neighbouring countries have a long history of social , cultural and religious cohesion and connectivity . On many occasions this relationship stood the test of times - more in favour of Pakistan at the time of its Independence and its wars with India . <p> With this background , bilateral issues could have been amicably worked out as both have understandable reasons for their cases . <p> Iran has significantly invested in completing its part of the pipeline with no recourse for return on its investment while Pakistan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commitment of completing the other half in its territory . It appears the fault lines between the two countries are far deeper and override historic relations . <p> The project has been facing a 10-year delay since 2014 . The GSPA ( Gas Sales Purchase Agreement ) was signed in 2009 under the French law with place of arbitration at the Arbitration Court at Paris which decides disputes that arise between two countries . Reportedly , the Arbitration Court does not recognise US sanctions . <p> Under the original agreement , Pakistan is bound to pay $1 million per day to Iran from January 1 , 2015 under the penalty clause . The project was to be implemented under a segmented approach , meaning Iran had to lay down the pipeline on its side and Pakistan was to build the pipeline on its territory . <p> It was to be completed by December 2014 and become functional from January 1 , 2015 . " The authorities in Pakistan had planned to partially implement the IP gas pipeline project by laying down an 81-km pipeline from Gwadar to the Iran border @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategy also could not be implemented , " officials said . <p> The Inter-State Gas Systems ( ISGS ) of Pakistan and National Iranian Gas Company ( NIGC ) inked the revised contract in September 2019 . Under the contract , Iran would not approach any international court if there was a delay in construction of the pipeline . <p> Under the revised contract , Pakistan was bound to erect the portion of pipeline inside its territory till February-March 2024 , after which it would have an intake of 750 million cubic feet of gas from Iran daily . Iran facilitated Pakistan and extended the 180-day deadline that expired in September 2024 . The authorities , however , again failed to lay down the pipeline . Then Iran served its final notice . <p> Under the French law , if Iran does not exercise its right to move the Arbitration Court till September 2024 , it would lose its right to initiate a legal battle against Pakistan . Iran earlier issued its second legal notice to Pakistan in November-December 2022 , asking Islamabad to construct a portion of the gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to pay a penalty in billions of dollars . <p> Pakistan cited its limitations to move ahead on the project and reportedly stated : " It is unable to move on with the project due to US sanctions and tried hard with US government to seek a US waiver which was not granted and that it has been warned of serious consequences if it gets in bed with Iran on the IP gas line project ' . " <p> Both Pakistan and Iran are in a dilemma . Iran has incurred substantial costs in laying its part of the pipeline with no return on investment and that if it did not exercise its right to move the Arbitration Court till September 2024 , it would have lost its right to initiate a legal battle against Pakistan , whereas Pakistan desperately needs gas from Iran to fuel its industry and businesses for its economic revival .

In 2023 , Europe saw a significant increase in its imports of refined oil from India , coinciding with a notable rise in India 's imports of Russian crude oil . This trend suggests that European consumers likely received large volumes of oil products originally sourced from Russia via India , despite sanctions imposed following Russia 's invasion of Ukraine , a report by The Independent said . <p> Data from independent sources shows that India became the top importer of Russian crude oil in 2023 , with an average of 1.75 million barrels per day , marking a 140% increase from 2022 . Concurrently , the European Union 's import of refined products from India surged by 115% , from 111,000 barrels per day in 2022 to 231,800 barrels per day in 2023 . <p> Sources state that this figure represents the highest in the past seven years and possibly the highest-ever . An analysis , for example , explains : " It has worked two-fold - India has been able to buy cheap oil for its refineries , then it has been able to refine that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and into a market ( Europe ) that is willing to pay up for them because it desperately needs to replace the loss of Russian material that it has applied sanctions on . " <p> This phenomenon of India capitalising on sanctions explains much about the sanctity of the sanctions ; it is more self-interest based and discriminatory , to say the least . It satisfied the dire need of Europe for refined oil , whereas India 's trade-off with the West with supply of defence goods worked well for all parties . More than this it explains that nations with economic muscles and global clout can have their way in global diplomacy . And this well explains different sanction rules for Pakistan and India .

Mr. Haroon joined GSK in 2011 as Head of In-Country Financial Shared Services and then progressed into diverse roles over the course of his career , leading various key local and above-country restructurings , M&amp;As , and change management projects . Mr. Haroon earned his Master of Business Administration ( MBA ) degree from the Institute of Business Administration ( IBA ) in 2013 and completed his Chartered Accountancy in 2005 . <p> Below are edited excerpts from a recent conversation BR Research had with him : <p> BR Research : Could you start by telling us a bit about your journey with Haleon Pakistan , especially since it 's a demerger from GSK ? <p> Farhan Haroon : My journey with the company began over 13 years ago , initially with GSK , and it 's been both challenging and immensely rewarding . I 've had the opportunity to work in a variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , restructuring , logistics , warehousing , and financial controls . These diverse experiences gave me an in-depth view of our industry and ultimately prepared me to lead Haleon Pakistan . <p> When the demerger happened , it was a pivotal moment . We took on a new name and a refreshed mission , focusing on self-care rather than the traditional pharmaceutical approach . This has been a transformative step , especially here in Pakistan , where the healthcare sector has historically focused on prescriptive medications . I 'm truly proud that Haleon has carved out a niche , leading the way as Pakistan 's largest self-care company and giving people the tools to proactively manage their own health . <p> BRR : Haleon 's focus on self-care is quite unique . Can you further elaborate on how the company has impacted the self-care landscape in Pakistan ? <p> FH : Absolutely , Haleon 's role has been groundbreaking . We 've worked to bring a fresh , empowering approach that encourages people to control their own health , introducing the concept of self-care rather than self-medication . This difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and maintain health proactively , not just treating conditions as they arise . <p> We have designed our product portfolio to provide practical support for this mission . For example , we offer a calcium supplement that is crucial here in Pakistan , where nearly one out of two women suffer from calcium deficiency -- a fact with significant implications , especially for pregnant and lactating women . Products like this meet genuine needs in the market and bring important health benefits . <p> Sensodyne tackles oral health , a neglected yet crucial aspect of overall well-being . Sensitivity accounts for 65% of the oral health issues faced by urban Pakistani consumers . Our aim is to make oral health a regular part of self-care for millions . Then there 's Panadol , which is incredibly popular and trusted , with nearly six billion tablets distributed annually . It 's amazing to see how deeply these products are embedded in people 's lives , helping them feel healthier and more in control . <p> In addition , our portfolio includes products like Voltral and Eno , which address needs ranging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's about more than individual products -- it 's about giving people a sense of control over their health . I genuinely believe we 're changing lives by shifting the focus to self-care , and I could n't be more thrilled to be a part of this transformation . <p> BRR : Recently , deregulation has brought some significant changes to the pharma sector . How has this impacted Haleon and the industry at large ? <p> FH : Deregulation has been a profound change for the industry , opening up new possibilities and reshaping market dynamics . To give some background , Pakistan recently adopted the WHO 's essential medicines list , which includes around 462 essential medications that remain price-controlled . However , market forces determine pricing for all non-essential products . <p> This change has had many positive effects . In the past , price controls often led to either high import costs or the emergence of counterfeit products in the market . By allowing prices for non-essential products to be market-determined , we 've been able to make these medications and supplements more accessible and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ensuring that health products remain within reach for the average consumer . <p> For Haleon , this has been a crucial shift . It has aided us in achieving topline growth and maintaining competitive pricing for our products . Even though volume growth remains steady , improved pricing flexibility has allowed us to focus on product quality and consistency . We 've also noticed that while overall volume growth is stable , the pricing changes have contributed directly to revenue growth -- showing that price adjustments play a crucial role in a market like ours . <p> On the export side , deregulation has been equally beneficial . With competitive , flexible pricing , we are in a better position to enter international markets and export our products in a way that is viable for both Pakistani and overseas markets . In short , deregulation has allowed us to better serve the public here at home while expanding our global reach . <p> BRR : You mentioned exports . Could you tell us more about the specific markets Haleon is targeting for its products and any regulatory challenges involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we continue to expand our production capabilities . Our Jamshoro plant , bolstered by a $10 million investment in high-speed manufacturing technology , positions us well for both local demand and international expansion . Vietnam , the Philippines , and Kenya are a few of the key markets where we are currently exporting our calcium supplement , CaC-1000 Plus . We 're excited about the potential to reach even more people with our self-care solutions . <p> Panadol is another product that holds tremendous promise for export . It 's not only highly effective but also affordable , making it a compelling choice for international consumers . In Pakistan , Panadol is among the most cost-effective pain relievers , and we 're working through regulatory processes to ensure that we can begin exporting it within the next year or so . <p> However , exporting has its complexities . Each country has its own regulatory requirements that we must meet before we can launch our products there . For instance , we need export licenses from Pakistani authorities and separate approvals from each importing country . This process includes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although this process is extensive , our focus on rigorous quality control helps us succeed in new markets . <p> Receiving the Export Award from the Pakistan Pharma Summit and Awards , presented by the Pakistan Senate Chairman , was a moment of pride for us , as it recognized our dedication to quality and our capacity to serve both local and international markets . It 's a clear signal of the work we 're doing and our readiness to make a positive impact beyond Pakistan 's borders . <p> BRR : Foreign direct investment ( FDI ) has historically been a challenge in Pakistan , especially in the pharmaceutical sector . What are your thoughts on the future of FDI here ? <p> FH : There 's no doubt that FDI has faced obstacles in Pakistan , especially with multinationals exiting the market due to strict price controls and rising input costs . It created a difficult environment for sustained growth , but with deregulation now in place , there 's new potential for investment . <p> I see this as a turning point . While multinationals may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with distribution partnerships , gradually increasing their involvement as the economic and regulatory environment stabilizes . <p> In terms of local manufacturing , end-to-end production -- especially for APIs ( active pharmaceutical ingredients ) -- is an area that needs focus . This level of investment requires not only a robust infrastructure but also a skilled workforce and sophisticated supply chains . Pakistan has largely depended on imported APIs , which impacts our local cost structure and supply reliability . Investing in API production would not only reduce dependency on imports but also support local manufacturing in a meaningful way . It 's a long-term vision , but one that could significantly enhance Pakistan 's appeal to foreign investors in pharma . <p> Collaboration between academia , industry , and regulatory bodies will be key to ensuring that our regulatory environment is trustworthy and conducive to FDI . I 'm optimistic , but it 's a journey that will take time . <p> BRR : Counterfeit drugs are a persistent problem in Pakistan . How does Haleon address this issue ? <p> FH : Unfortunately , economic factors often drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products are expensive or unavailable , counterfeit versions often fill the gap . A clear example is our Iodex brand , which we stopped producing in 2018 . Yet , counterfeit versions remain in circulation . In some cases , we have found fake versions of Iodex with future expiry dates -- clearly impossible for a product we no longer produce . This is not only harmful to consumers but also presents serious challenges for companies like ours . Combating this requires dedicated resources for both enforcement and consumer awareness . We are committed to tackling this issue , but it 's an ongoing challenge that demands strong regulatory support . <p> The best way to combat counterfeiting is through a stable , economically viable pricing strategy . Ideally , we should index price adjustments to inflation or the CPI to maintain the affordability and accessibility of legitimate products . Additionally , enforcement needs to be both strict and consistent . Regulatory bodies and manufacturers must work together to prevent counterfeit products from entering the market and hold violators accountable . We work closely with local authorities , and our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counterfeits in our segment . <p> BRR : Lastly , could you share some of Haleon 's efforts in environmental , social , and governance ( ESG ) initiatives ? <p> FH : I 'm incredibly proud of Haleon 's commitment to ESG . It 's more than a business strategy for us -- it 's a core value . We 're making significant strides to reduce our environmental impact . We have invested in solar infrastructure which reduces our dependency on non-renewable energy sources . We have invested in energy-efficient electric chillers which are helping to reduce carbon emissions and move towards achieving carbon neutrality . Sustainability is a priority across our operations , including packaging where we are exploring recycled-ready and recycled materials , while ensuring product quality .

While Biden refuses to penalise Israel for crimes against humanity , Trump actively approves of them . <p> The only likely path to peace is now Netanyahu 's notorious corruption catching up with him - he is credibly accused of using war to delay his trial and has been urging far-right allies to help him further delay a court appearance in December .

At the root of all ills are the deals with Independent Power Producers ( IPPs ) that are taking a heavy toll on the public purse . Under a new plan of the Power Division , the government has Hobson 's choice of either opting to settle the outstanding Rs1.8 trillion liabilities by issuing five-year fixed interest rate bonds or to refinance the existing debt . In both the cases , the power consumers will be on the receiving end . This fixation has deprived the people of the possibility of a price cut of Rs4 per unit on their already inflated electricity bills , wherein presently they are compelled to pay Rs24 per unit as capacity payment . <p> The horrifying statistics are unbelievable as the total cost of theft and low recoveries stand at Rs591 billion , which is projected to increase to Rs637 billion .

So is the case with the attempts to reschedule energy debt with China . The plot thickens as Chinese energy companies also rule out the possibility of renegotiating the contracts , related to profits and idle capacity payments agreed under the power purchase agreements . <p> This enigma of circular debt can not be hushed away with arithmetical gimmicks . It necessitates a comprehensive action in which the underlining should be to relieve the masses of burden , and enable the economy to stage a comeback . With power tariffs highest in the region , it would be futile to think of bouncing back in exports and production . It is simply unacceptable that capacity payments account for 70% of the electricity tariff , with the remaining 30% being attributed to energy costs .

He can be reached at **26;685;TOOLONG <p> Inherited from the British colonial rule , Pakistan 's education system has failed to meet modern-day needs , as it was originally designed to produce clerks and functionaries , not critical thinkers or creative solution providers . The legacy of the " downward filtration " theory - an education system designed to create a class of individuals who are native in appearance but Western in outlook - continues to obstruct progress . <p> One of the earliest and most distinguished attempts to establish a strong educational foundation came with the First Education Conference of 1947 , chaired by Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah . His address at the conference provided clear direction , asserting education as the key to improving the nation 's standing . Jinnah made it clear that education should not only focus on academics but also cover science and technology to build a future-ready nation . He emphasised the need for well-trained teachers , as they are fundamental to developing a quality education system . <p> Notwithstanding these early efforts , our education system has fallen short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of issues , including political interference , linguistic diversity , economic shortfalls and geographical barriers . Over the years , several educational policies have been drafted during national meetings , aiming to address these challenges . However , these policies often fail when it comes to implementation , leading to an ongoing struggle to improve the sector . <p> The problems within our education system are glaring : outdated syllabi , rote learning and a lack of practical knowledge . Examinations often miss the mark , and cheating , sometimes validated by teachers and parents , has become widespread . Moreover , many teachers lack an understanding of student psychology , a crucial aspect of effective teaching . Without this , the learning process becomes mechanical rather than engaging . <p> At a higher level , education has been neglected as a national priority .

Unfortunately , the system has produced an elite class that benefits from the status quo while leaving the majority behind . This educated minority flourishes in the chaos , with little concern for the country 's larger educational and socio-economic problems . <p> In a country already facing multiple crises , allocating a mere 2% of the GDP to the education budget deepens the issue . Intellectuals and experts have long argued that the solution to many of the country 's problems lies in providing sound , quality education . <p> This outdated system is not just a relic of the past , it actively harms the country 's future by failing to prepare young people to tackle the challenges of today .

Education can be the engine of progress and prosperity . With the right policies and collective effort , Pakistan can reform its education system .

@@118214237 <p> Pakistan 's banking sector faces a systemic issue of credit concentration , where a significant portion of bank loans is directed towards a small number of large borrowers . As of 2023 , the country 's commercial banks reported Rs13 trillion in gross advances , with Rs3.2 trillion -- or 25 percent -- accounted for by the top ten exposures of each bank . This stark concentration reveals a troubling reliance on a few large clients , exacerbating risks in an already fragile financial system . <p> While sovereign borrowing for deficit financing is frequently blamed for the low penetration of banking credit , the issue goes deeper .

As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serves as a case study for the industry , demonstrating that proactive risk management and a commitment to diversified lending can mitigate concentration risks . <p> The concentration of credit within Pakistan 's banking sector raises significant concerns about systemic risk and financial stability . A high concentration of loans among a small number of borrowers increases the vulnerability of banks to defaults , especially in an economy marked by political instability , sluggish growth , and high inflation . The situation is further exacerbated by the absence of meaningful differences in performance between public , private , and Islamic banks , pointing to a sector-wide failure to diversify lending practices . <p> Bankers often cite factors such as collateral adequacy and regulatory constraints as reasons for credit concentration . However , the stark disparity between the performance of institutions like Bank Alfalah and others such as Allied Bank or Standard Chartered suggests that these excuses lack merit .

After taking a bath , I opened the front door of the lounge and sat in the driver 's seat of my graphite gray 2023 hybrid Kia Niro . <p> On my way to the office , I saw many electric mopeds and scooters driven by students in shiny uniforms with helmets . <p> Peshawar Road was bustling with electric vehicles and hybrid SUVs . In some places , I also saw electric three-wheelers with fancy colors and designs . <p> The noise level was very comfortable , and the air quality felt noticeably cleaner . The city seemed to be embracing a more sustainable and eco-friendly mode of transportation . Young professionals rode electric motorbikes in the extreme left lane of the main road . <p> I spotted a solar-powered charging station for electric vehicles in the shopping mall parking lot and another by the roadside , with a large electronic display showing three empty stations and one occupied . There were very few fossil fuel vehicles ( FFVs ) on the road , and I saw only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority were either Chinese or Pakistani . <p> An electronic display showed the current air quality index , and all indicators were within green limits . My cell phone showed a call from my wife , informing me that she would pick up the kids from school in her newly purchased MG4 EV , as she would be free from shopping by then . It was a relief , as I had a meeting scheduled right after work and would n't have been able to pick them up myself . I saw a family of six getting off a Yutong EV bus at the bus stop . <p> The bus had a sleek design and looked very spacious inside . Suddenly , I heard a constant beep . I was n't sure where it was coming from , and then there was silence and heat . I was sweating in my bed ; the fan had stopped due to a UPS shutdown . I had been enjoying a dream that felt so real , but now I was wide awake in my dark room . <p> " Dreams are dreams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murmured , trying to shake off the remnants of sleep . I wished my dream could come true , but I knew it was just my imagination . <p> Pakistan , the fifth most populous country on earth with a massive youth bulge , has an automotive sector on the brink of collapse . Despite immense potential and talent , economic instability and political turmoil hold the country back . Peter Drucker called the automotive industry the " mother of all industries , " but in Pakistan , it is not respected , leading to widespread disruption . <p> Numerous attempts to revitalize the industry through Automotive Industry Development Programs ( AIDPs ) have failed to achieve long-term growth and stability . Pakistani scholars have extensively researched the causes of the industry 's poor performance , but merely listing issues has not addressed the root problems . <p> The government seeks private investors and foreign companies to stimulate growth and stability , while investors seek stable economic policies and a skilled workforce . <p> A vicious cycle of malice and corruption hinders progress , eroding trust in the government and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . As a result , the country 's economy suffers , and people lose hope for affordable , decent cars for their families . <p> The domestic automotive industry , despite massive demand potential , seems helpless . The Automotive Industry Development and Export Policy ( AIDEP ) 2021 -- 2026 was launched to attract investors and boost the sector . Ambitious production targets were set to stimulate growth and create jobs , but results have yet to meet expectations . <p> Even Thailand , Malaysia , and Indonesia are producing batteries and other accessories for hybrid and electric vehicles ( EVs ) and are assembling these cars in collaboration with Japanese and German OEMs . <p> However , in Pakistan , authorities spend too much time planning changes instead of taking concrete actions to implement them . The automotive industry has forward and backward linkages with many other industries , so strengthening it would support the overall industrial ecosystem in the country . This approach would ultimately lead to economic growth and job creation . <p> Currently , Toyota has started limited assembly operations for the Corolla Cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 10 million PKR . Sazgar Engineering Works Limited ( SEWL ) , in collaboration with Great Wall Motors ( GWM ) , has also offered two locally assembled hybrid vehicles , Haval and Jolion , each priced at around 10 million PKR . <p> The big question remains : how many customers will be able to afford such high-priced vehicles in a country ranked 52nd among the poorest countries by the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) ? Although the Pakistani government has given tax incentives to assemblers to encourage the production of electric vehicles , another question arises regarding the affordability of these vehicles for the general public with low to medium income levels . <p> Are these tax incentives enough to make electric and hybrid vehicles accessible to all income levels in Pakistan ? <p> The AIDEP ( 2021 -- 26 ) and National Electric Vehicle Policy ( NEVP ) mostly focus on granting tax incentives to manufacturers and importers rather than addressing the affordability of these vehicles for the general public with low to medium income levels . <p> This approach may limit the potential impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income levels in Pakistan . To date , no company has shown any interest in assembling buses or trucks in Pakistan , and it is likely this will continue for the foreseeable future . <p> Research and development efforts in electric mobility are undertaken in silos , with centers established under public and private academic and non-academic institutions . <p> However , there is still a long way to go for widespread adoption and implementation . The infrastructure for electric vehicles needs significant improvement to support mass adoption . Plans to establish electric charging stations in prominent , easily accessible locations with clear and efficient payment methods have not been undertaken yet . The authorities responsible for such plans are preoccupied with other tasks . <p> Even for two and three-wheelers , no comprehensive mechanism has been envisioned to promote electrification . China , currently the forerunner in electric mobility , has successfully implemented a battery swapping option for two-wheelers and light utility vehicles . <p> The current politico-economic situation has put the entire automotive industrial sector in a standstill . From large to small-scale industries , owners are concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from energy security to automotive policies . This uncertainty has caused a significant decrease in investments and production levels across the board . <p> These difficulties have particularly affected Lahore , an important automotive hub in the country . Gujranwala , another major industrial city , has also felt the impact , as the light engineering cluster in the city has experienced a decline in orders and revenue . <p> The conundrum becomes even more challenging as the population grows rapidly , increasing the demand for automobiles , while the local industry is not ready to capitalize on this situation . <p> Industrialists look to the government , the government looks to investors , investors look for opportunities , and the cycle continues with no clear solution in sight . As a result , the local industry remains stagnant and unable to grow in the current economic climate . <p> My dream haunts me every night , reminding me of the potential that is being wasted . Things will never change unless efforts are made to improve them . As Einstein once said , " You can not solve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You must learn to see the world anew . " Pakistan 's automotive industry problems must be approached with a fresh perspective and innovative solutions . It 's concerning that past efforts have not yielded the desired results , and it 's time to do something different . <p> Institutes like the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics ( PIDE ) , Engineering Development Board ( EDB ) , and Pakistan Association of Automotive Parts and Accessories Manufacturers ( PAAPAM ) are working to revive the industry with new suggestions . <p> The need of the hour is to vigorously pursue an action plan to lift the industry out of its downturn . Complex problems do not always require complex solutions . Simple but consistent solutions might help . Stakeholders need to collaborate effectively to find and implement such solutions . <p> Academia plays a crucial role in providing the necessary research and expertise to find indigenous solutions . The government needs to provide a clear roadmap for selected engineering institutes to undertake research in the automotive sector , especially electric mobility . Sufficient funding and resources should be allocated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems , and solar-based hybrid charging stations . <p> Additionally , the government should formulate policies to attract foreign direct investments without unduly protecting existing market players , who have not delivered as expected for the last four to five decades . The industry should focus on two/three-wheelers and small cars to meet market demand . <p> Business communities and chambers , aware of the significance of global markets and export orientation , should encourage small and medium enterprises ( SMEs ) to set goals and provide the necessary help to achieve sustainable growth in the automotive industry . <p> Dreams do come true if you work hard enough to make them a reality . India , Malaysia , and Thailand are examples of countries that have successfully implemented policies to support their automotive industries ( especially SMEs making auto parts ) and realized their dreams of becoming major players in the global market . Their citizens have better transport choices and job opportunities . <p> A thriving automotive sector promotes economic growth and innovation , creating a positive ripple effect across other industries . When the " mother " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " benefits and thrives . Dreams become more achievable , and relationships are strengthened . I wish and hope that someday , when my son wakes up , he finds the roads as I have seen them in my dream .

This was just the latest instance of the government 's increasing use of digital blackouts as a tool to suppress dissent and control the flow of information . <p> Over the past year , there have been multiple actions that have impacted both fundamental freedoms and the IT sector 's immense economic potential , including social media bans like the one on X , and the setting up of a firewall , or what the government has conveniently termed a Web Management System , which caused internet speeds to plummet by up to 30-40 percent in recent months . <p> Additionally , the introduction of draconian laws that give vague definitions of what constitutes ' harmful ' speech to stifle opposition and the ongoing clampdown on VPNs further demonstrate the authorities ' tightening grip on the digital sphere . <p> All these actions have combined to not only curb core liberties , they are also undermining the very environment that is needed to promote innovation , attract investors in the digital ecosphere , and posit the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards authoritarianism has clearly led to the digital sphere emerging as a battleground for suppressing dissent . Although the country 's history is replete with countless instances of restrictions on critical voices , the above-mentioned actions are threatening to take this pattern to alarming extremes . <p> The authorities either do not realise the extent of the harm they are wreaking on the digital landscape and the immense potential it has in propping up a fragile economy , or they simply do n't care about the consequences of their actions . <p> All the lofty rhetoric regarding boosting of IT exports and establishing a thriving digital ecosystem ends up sounding hollow as it is evident that the powers-that-be would rather shut off the country from the digital revolution the world is experiencing and the vast opportunities for economic growth and development it offers than be faced with speech that they deem harmful . <p> This is not to say that there should be tolerance for speech that incites hatred and violence . However , the government 's approach is akin to throwing out the baby with the bathwater , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , clamping down on VPNs , banning of websites and hounding of those who voice criticism does not only curtail essential debate , it also carries grave economic consequences . <p> The resulting suppression of innovation , the potential collapse of IT businesses , and the disruption of the freelance ecosystem , which millions rely on for their livelihoods , threaten to undermine the foundations of Pakistan 's digital economy . 
@@118256234 <p> Higher education plays a vital role in shaping both individual and societal growth . It equips young people with critical thinking skills , specialised knowledge and personal development opportunities , all of which are crucial in today 's interconnected and rapidly changing world . <p> Universities are the centres of research and development that tackle some of the world 's most pressing challenges , creating innovative solutions across various fields . Research journals ( in particular ) serve as platforms for disseminating these findings , ensuring quality through peer review and advancing scholarly discourse . They are not just publications but vital instruments that promote intellectual progress , collaboration , and innovation . <p> For higher education to thrive , it must be supported by all levels of society , including governments , institutions , and communities . <p> The Higher Education Commission ( HEC ) , Pakistan , has a critical role in shaping the landscape of higher education in the country . It should ideally act as an enabler of growth and innovation , ensuring that the sector operates efficiently , aligns with global standards and fosters accessibility to all . <p> A central function of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are essential for advancing research in the country . This task is managed by the Research &amp; Innovation Division of HEC . <p> Only papers published in HEC-recognised journals are accepted for rewards or recognition . However , despite claims of facilitating national research journals , the process for journal accreditation often reveals a deeply entrenched bureaucracy ( sarkari babus ) , characterised by inefficiency and apathy toward academic progress . <p> Take , for example , the journal evaluation process . Although the official timeline spans several months ( from the start of evaluations in April to the announcement of results in September , followed by an appeal process that concludes in November ) the cycle is fundamentally flawed . Journals accredited through the review and appeal process are given just four months before the next evaluation . This severely limits their ability to prepare for the next cycle , undermining the opportunity for meaningful improvement or fair competition . <p> This creates a frustrating paradox , where the very system meant to support academic growth instead fosters instability and inefficiency . <p> Furthermore , this bureaucratic rigidity discourages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( reluctant to submit to journals that are not recognised by HEC ) inadvertently contribute to a system that stifles the diversity and evolution of academic publishing . This short-sighted approach undermines the potential for emerging research to gain traction and hinders the growth of knowledge in specialised fields . <p> Compounding this issue is the lack of accountability within HEC . Complaints have surfaced regarding the conduct of certain staff involved in the journal evaluation process , with allegations of unprofessional behaviour , incompetence , and even conflicts of interest . In one case , a complaint was filed against an official for soliciting substandard papers from acquaintances and family members . <p> Despite these allegations , the individual in question was retained and promoted , with no public information about any investigation or disciplinary action . Such lapses in accountability create an environment where arbitrary decisions can flourish without proper scrutiny . <p> The NED University Journal of Research provides a striking example of these systemic issues . Published by NED University of Engineering and Technology , Karachi , the journal has been a reputable platform for research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Y ' category journal in 2011 by HEC and later upgraded to ' X ' category in 2013 . <p> However , when HEC introduced its new HJRS database in 2020 , the journal was inexplicably removed from the list of accredited publications . This abrupt decision caused a significant loss of trust among local researchers and authors , undermining the journal 's credibility . <p> Despite being reinstated in 2021 , the journal was once again removed from the HJRS list in 2022 . Ironically , during this period , the global indexing agency Scopus evaluated the journal and chose to include it in its global database in September 2022 . This inconsistency raises serious questions about the transparency and fairness of the HEC 's decision-making process . <p> Particularly troubling is the fact that the qualifications and experience of the reviewers involved in these decisions are not disclosed , leaving room for the possibility of biased or uninformed assessments . One reviewer even criticised the journal 's website for not being ' user-friendly , ' as if the quality of academic research were somehow linked to website navigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of individual journals but also threaten the credibility of Pakistan 's academic ecosystem . The HEC 's inability to provide consistent , transparent and accountable oversight of academic journals diminishes the value of academic publications in the eyes of both national and international scholars . <p> Supporting research journals is crucial for the health of higher education . High-quality journals ensure access to credible research , foster interdisciplinary collaboration and help universities maintain global relevance . Effective policymaking and transparent procedures are essential to creating an academic environment where research and scholarship can thrive . <p> For Pakistan to compete on the global stage , it must reform the HEC 's journal accreditation process to ensure that it is not only fair but also conducive to the development of a dynamic and inclusive academic ecosystem . This requires not just administrative efficiency , but a commitment to fostering genuine academic integrity and progress . <p> Only through meaningful reform can we build an academic system that truly serves the needs of researchers , institutions , and the nation as a whole .

The progress of integrating VRE into our energy mix has been , indeed , disappointing , standing merely at seven percent of the total energy mix as of March 2024 . <p> This low progress is in spite of the fact that Pakistan has immense solar and wind energy potential .

This situation begs a serious question : if the prices of renewable energy have fallen so drastically , why are investors not ready to invest in it in Pakistan ? <p> The answer lies in the country 's regulatory and financial landscape for VRE investors . Most policies for renewable energy are based on the same frameworks as those designed for fossil fuels .
