They are also less likely than older women to get prenatal care , and more likely to experience stigma and discrimination in healthcare facilities if they do seek care . <p> All of the factors can complicate both pregnancy and childbirth . Maternal health complications are among the leading causes of death for adolescent girls worldwide . <p> The good news is that teenage pregnancies have declined in some parts of the world . However , they remain high in South Africa , especially in the country 's rural and low-income areas . <p> We are demographers specialising in public health dynamics in South Africa . We focus especially on maternal mortality , reproductive health , and the socio-economic determinants affecting population health . <p> In a recent study we sought to understand the factors that contribute to teenage pregnancies in South Africa . To do so we interviewed 20 young women . They were either pregnant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teenagers . We also analysed previous studies on the subject of teenage pregnancy . <p> Our findings make it clear that limited access to quality healthcare , socioeconomic challenges and a lack of awareness about pregnancy-related risks are all making teenage girls more vulnerable than older women to dying while pregnant , while giving birth or because of complications after they have given birth . <p> There 's a clear need for policies that improve healthcare access , reproductive health education , and support systems for young women . We hope the insights from our study will provide a foundation for reducing maternal mortality rates . This , in turn , can contribute to meeting broader health goals and addressing disparities in healthcare for young mothers in South Africa . <p> What the research found <p> A total of 20 young women aged between 15 and 24 who attended a health facility in Johannesburg were interviewed . They came from various backgrounds , including urban , suburban and rural areas . Most of them were single and unemployed , and had not studied further after completing their secondary education . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maternal mortality , the availability and accessibility of health services , and the participants ' knowledge about pregnancy . <p> The study also explored how social influences , such as family and community views , influenced their decisions about using contraceptives and considering abortion as an option . <p> Many shared stories about stigma and isolation . They also talked about the difficult choices they had to make because of social pressures and a lack of support . This included support from their partners . One said : " As soon as I told him who the baby 's father was ( which is him ) , he told me I should talk to the baby 's father because he is not . " <p> The young women often relied on their peers rather than their families for guidance , largely due to fear of disappointing or being reprimanded and punished by their parents . This fear is commonly expressed in research about teenage pregnancy . Unfortunately , their peers often have limited knowledge about sexual reproduction and health . <p> One participant explained that she 'd been taking contraceptive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective contraceptive use or awareness that contraceptives can not guarantee unintended pregnancies . <p> There is a strong correlation between educational attainment and reduced teenage pregnancy rates . Educational policies that keep girls in school have been shown to reduce their likelihood of becoming pregnant at a young age . Additionally , adolescents with higher levels of education are more likely to be aware of maternal health services and danger signs during pregnancy than their peers . This lowers their risk of complications . <p> For many of our participants , unplanned pregnancies placed them in the difficult position of choosing between continuing their education , or facing possible social exclusion . <p> Changing the situation <p> The findings shed light on the vulnerabilities of teenage mothers in South Africa . This group needs accessible healthcare that meets their unique needs as adolescents -- for instance , age-appropriate , non-judgmental counselling and guidance on prenatal and postnatal care . <p> They often require additional support in understanding contraceptive options to prevent repeat pregnancies , mental health support to address the psychological stress of early motherhood , and tailored educational resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to complications like anaemia and preterm labour , which require targeted monitoring and intervention . Healthcare workers should be trained specifically to deal with these issues . <p> The research underscores the importance of educational policies that target teenage pregnancy prevention . By keeping young girls in school and providing them with comprehensive sexual education , the risk factors for early pregnancies can be significantly reduced . <p> But education need n't be limited to classrooms . Policies should also focus on increasing awareness of maternal health danger signs among adolescents . Public health campaigns that target teenagers , particularly in high-risk areas , could help young mothers understand the risks associated with pregnancy and encourage them to seek help early . <p> Improving maternal health outcomes for adolescent mothers will not only save lives : it will also improve women 's overall life expectancy . This has been the case in at least two countries : Rwanda and Sri Lanka . <p> In 2000 , Rwanda 's maternal mortality rate was 1,007 deaths per 100,000 live births . In 2020 it stood at 259 deaths per 100,000 live births @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other global health bodies regard a maternal mortality rate of 70 deaths or fewer per 100,000 live births as the target for countries to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 3 , which aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages . <p> However , it is a vast improvement from the 2000 figure . Rwanda has achieved this by , among other things , focusing on accessible maternal healthcare services , training community health workers , and providing financial support for maternal services . <p> Crucially , special programmes are in place to meet young mothers ' unique needs , such as confidential reproductive health counselling , reducing stigma , and encouraging teenage mothers to use healthcare facilities .

Although there has been grassroots interaction between Tanzania and Yamagata for more than 25 years , they started more active exchanges in 2016 when Nagai City was registered as a host town for Tanzania athletes for the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympics . <p> I am excited to see how the friendship between the two cities will continue to grow in the future . <p> Tanzania is one of recipients of donors ' support , and now JICA has been active for 62 years in Tanzania , in which areas has Japan been supporting Tanzania and how do you assess the Japan Internation Agency 's ( JICA ) achievements in bringing positive changes to the people ? <p> Looking back at our history , Japan has supported many symbolic projects , including the development of the Lower Moshi Irrigation Scheme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Malindi Fish Landing and Marketing facilities at the request of the government of Tanzania . <p> Some Tanzanians may have the impression that Japan has focused on infrastructure development projects , but this is not the only area in which we are working . <p> While the Japanese government 's foreign aid strategy is formulated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , most concrete projects are planned and implemented by JICA . <p> The JICA office in Tanzania is one of the largest JICA offices on the African continent and they work very closely with the government of Tanzania and its people . <p> JICA is engaged with a wide range of activities such as agriculture , blue economy , industrial development , health care , local governance , empowerment of women and all kinds of capacity building . <p> Some of these activities include dispatching of Japan Overseas Cooperation Volunteers to teach students , support hospitals and collaborate with local communities .

This unique event , inspired by initiative of Mr Juma Ikangaa , a former Tanzanian Olympian , is organised by JICA Tanzania office along with the National Sport Council of Tanzania , having the support of various stakeholders within and outside Tanzania . <p> I believe this could be a wonderful chance for girls who are keen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was very good news for me to hear that of participants in last year 's ' Ladies First ' took part in the track and field competition at this year 's Paris Olympics . <p> ' Ladies First ' in 2024 will be held on from November 23 to November 24 , this year at Benjamin Mkapa Stadium . I hope that many Tanzanians will enjoy seeing the highest-level competition of Tanzania female athletes there . <p> While major development projects of our government are planned and conducted by JICA , the Embassy has conducted many small-scale projects which directly benefit the grassroots communities such as construction of school buildings , dormitories , and toilets as well as establishment of clinics and dispensaries in the local areas . Since 1989 , the Embassy has implemented nearly 400 projects under the scheme of Grant Assistance for Grassroots Human Security Projects . <p> Last month I participated in the handing-over ceremony of toilets and water tank of Mzumuni Secondary School in Kinondoni District , Dar es Salaam .

The 1970 world Expo was also the first World Expo that Tanzania participated in . <p> I believe this was Tanzania 's first appearance on the glamorous international economic stage shortly after independence . <p> Since then , economic relations between Tanzania and Japan have developed .

From 2017 to 2022 , Tanzania 's exports to Japan increased at an annual rate of 1.59 per cent . <p> In terms of investment , there are several major Japanese companies operating in Tanzania . <p> In the 1960s , shortly after Tanzania gained independence , Konosuke Matsushita , the founder of Panasonic , opened a transistor radio factory to promote manufacturing in Tanzania and later began manufacturing dry batteries . <p> I think that many older people in Tanzania are familiar with transistor radios and dry cell batteries made by " National " , the old name for Panasonic .

As long as there is a request from Tanzania , we would like to continue to send teachers . <p> In the field of higher education , Japan has been accepting international students from Tanzania for a long time . <p> The Japanese Ministry of Education , Culture , Sports , Science and Technology offers scholarships , so called MEXT scholarship , for Tanzanian students to study at Japanese universities . <p> The scholarship is available for both undergraduate and postgraduate studies .

Consumers often lose money without even realising it . <p> They may realise that the products they buy are fake when they accidentally take them to a genuine dealer for repair . <p> Secondly , genuine manufacturers lose profits because the existence of cheap counterfeits prevents them from selling their genuine products . <p> However , what is even more problematic is that the reputation of genuine products is damaged when people mistake low-quality counterfeits for genuine products . <p> In a market where good quality products are not properly valued and sold at a fair price , no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason why Tanzania 's manufacturing industry has not developed is largely due to the culture of putting up with " cheap , bad products " in Tanzania <p> To improve this situation , the Tanzanian government 's first task is not only to establish appropriate standards , but also to ensure that those standards are thoroughly implemented and enforced . <p> Even if standards are established in Tanzania , there are often no systems or structures in place to enforce them . <p> That situation should be changed . At the same time , it is important that all Tanzanian consumers have the will and ability to judge the quality of products . <p> In Japan , there is a proverb that says , ' buying cheap goods is waste of money/You get what you pay for " . <p> I would like people to think that buying a reliable product made by a reliable manufacturer , even if it is a little more expensive , because that is more profitable in the medium to long term than buying a cheap product that breaks easily . <p> Until such thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop the proliferation of counterfeit and other such products , and I think it will also hinder the development of Tanzania 's manufacturing industry . <p> If the government of Tanzania is willing to work on reforming the countermeasures against fake products and raising people 's awareness in this regard , Japan is ready to cooperate in any way possible . <p> As a diplomat , how do you assess the performance of President Samia Suluhu Hassan ' s government . <p> As a diplomat , I would like to refrain making any light-hearted comment about the leader of the country in which I am assigned . <p> However , I personally respect and applaud the strong leadership of H.E .

Already , by the mid-1980s , Dar es Salaam was presenting huge governance challenges so much so that in June 1996 , the Dar es Salaam City Council was disbanded and was replaced by a City Commission . The Commission did a great job of cleaning up the city and improving infrastructure . However , its tenure was temporary . <p> During this interim period , the future of the local governance structure for Dar es Salaam was contemplated . The unitary structure was seen as being inadequate to handle city matters , as it had grown considerably large .

Ilala got the city centre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the high value area of Oysterbay ; and Temeke got the port , the airport and the industrial area . <p> In 2014 , two other municipalities , Kigamboni and Ubungo were created , out of the Temeke and Kinondoni municipalities respectively . <p> A Dar es Salaam City Council ( DCC ) was also established , with separate responsibilities from the municipalities , as an overarching authority to mainly coordinate issues and attend to issues cutting across the municipalities ; and matters of inter-dependency such as inter-district road networks and joint activities such as transport , environment , tourism , employment and the like . Soon , however , clashes developed between the five municipalities and the overarching DCC , which had no physical territory . Clashes also included misunderstandings over sources of revenue . In February 2021 the DCC was abolished and its duties transferred to the Ilala Municipality which was elevated to a ( Dar es Salaam ) City Council , possibly shedding its name of Ilala . <p> This situation seems to be unsatisfactory and the Minister of State in charge of local government said recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All major cities around the world have a ' Metropolitan City ' and we can not have councils operating in isolation .
