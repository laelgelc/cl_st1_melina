@@105035230 <p> The Toyota GR Yaris has received a minor change , and the ' evolved ' car has been unveiled at the 2024 Tokyo Auto Salon , four years after the rally-bred hatchback first surfaced at the tuner show . The major points are an eight-speed automatic option , more power and torque and a new driver-angled cockpit/revised driving position , among other things . <p> UPDATE:Live pics from Tokyo Auto Salon added <p> Since launch , TGR has been racing the GR Yaris in various motorsports , implementing " driver-first car-making " through repeated " breaking and fixing " in extreme environments . Feedback from pro race drivers and evaluation drivers -- as well as Toyota 's own chairman cum Master Driver , Akio Toyoda a.k.a . Morizo -- have been incorporated in this evolved car , ' to comprehensively enhance vehicle performance ' . <p> The big news is that the GR Yaris -- previously manual-only -- can now be had with an eight-speed auto called the Gazoo Racing Direct Automatic Transmission , which has " transmission speed and reliability that can be enjoyed by a wide range of people , " TGR says . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ optimised for sporty driving . It delicately senses the way the driver steps on the brakes and operates the accelerator , and by doing so , the box anticipates when gear shifting is necessary even before changes in vehicle behaviour occur , realising gear selection that reflects the driver 's intentions , " leading to gear selection that is similar to how professional drivers shift gears " . <p> Also , the use of highly heat-resistant friction material in the gear-shift clutch and enhancements to the transmission 's control software have resulted in ' world-class gear-shifting speeds ' , TGR says . There are more gears here than in the 6MT , which makes the most of the engine 's power band . The RZ " High performance " trim level is equipped with a Torsen LSD . <p> There 's more power and torque too -- from the original 272 PS and 370 Nm to 304 PS and 400 Nm . That 's an increase of 32 PS and 30 Nm . The higher engine output and the availability of the auto gearbox requires improved cooling performance , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition , a sub-radiator , cool air intake and intercooler spray are now available as a factory-installed Cooling Package option . <p> Click to enlarge <p> New to the GR Yaris is Drive Mode Select , where the electronic power steering , air con and powertrain changes according to Sport , Normal or Eco mode . Sport gets a different gauge cluster design too . The 4WD mode selection function remains as it is . <p> The changes go as deep as the body shell . The number of bolts fastening the body to the shock absorbers has been increased from one to three to suppress alignment changes during driving , thereby increasing the responsiveness of the vehicle to steering input , improving handling stability . The team also increased the number of spot welding points by around 13% and expanded the areas where structural adhesive is applied by approximately 24% -- this improves body rigidity , which leads to better handling and ride comfort . <p> The GR Yaris can be maxed out on track with the Circuit Mode , which includes anti-lag control ( controlled turbo lag reduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the speed limiter ( upon entering a circuit , as determined by GPS ) , max engine fan output and a shift timing indicator . Each function can be customised using a smartphone app . <p> Click to enlarge <p> We reach cosmetics . Perhaps that 's not the best word as changes to the 2024 GR Yaris ' exterior are functional . Up front , the lower grille features a steel mesh that is thin and lightweight but still strong ( GR-FOUR clearly visible ) , and the sides of the lower front bumper have a new separable structure . The latter makes restoration and replacement work easier . <p> You 'll also find larger openings here for better cooling , and to the sides , there are outlets to exhaust heat from the sub-radiator and ATF cooler . An opening at the lower edge of the rear lower garnish allows air from under the floor to escape , which reduces drag and allows heat from the muffler to escape . <p> Even the cue that 's seemingly aesthetic -- the new tail lamp cluster with full-width LED signatures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the upper and lower rear lamps have been consolidated to avoid damage and improve visibility , while the third brake light has been separated from the rear spoiler , increasing the wing 's customisability . Interestingly , there 's now no Toyota logo at the rear , a big contrast from the GR Supra 's double-signed butt . <p> The interior changes are more significant than on the outside , and while it 's not very pretty ( like a bus to me , what do you think ? ) , the new cockpit is said to be race car inspired , specifically by Super Taikyu Series and Japanese Rally Championship machines . The centre stack has been tilted 15 degrees towards the driver for enhanced visibility and operability -- things are closer to the driver now . <p> The latter has also been improved by way of raising the shift lever 75 mm compared to the current CVT-equipped GR Yaris RS and placing it in the same position as the shift lever on the manual version . Even the automatic version gets a hand brake instead of the usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vertical parking brake , rally ( or drift ) style , for the competition-oriented RC trim level . <p> Also very racing is the new 12.3-inch colour instrument panel . For the auto variant , in addition to an automatic transmission oil temperature display , a visual warning has been added to the gear position display to augment the conventional sound-only alarm , which is to tell the driver that downshifting is not possible due to overly high rpms . <p> Last but not least , as we felt the original driving position was relatively high for a sports car , driving posture has been improved by lowering the driving position by 25 mm , with corresponding lowering of the steering wheel position . Also , forward visibility has been expanded by moving the rearview mirror to the top of the windshield and lowering the upper edge of the centre cluster by 50 mm . <p> All these changes make the GR Yaris more capable than the limited edition GRMN Yaris that was unveiled at the 2022 Tokyo Auto Salon . As such , good guy Gazoo is preparing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level as the 2024 GR Yaris , with an exclusive emblem that signifies the upgrade . <p> TGR also announced that the GR Yaris RZ " High performance*S ? bastien Ogier Edition " and GR Yaris RZ " High performance*Kalle Rovanper ? Edition " concept models shown at last year 's Tokyo Auto Salon will be produced , based on the latest base car .

This is a small car , but it 's a big deal . The big T really did n't have to make the GR Yaris , but made it they did . <p> Here 's the deal . To us , the GR Yaris is the spiritual successor to the famous Celica GT-Four from the 80s/90s . You know , the Castrol liveried WRC car you played in Sega Rally -- yes , that one . This is because the GR Yaris ' reason to exist is the World Rally Championship , like that famous Celica homologation special . Or the Evo and WRX STI of yesteryear . <p> To be sure , there 's a new Yaris in town ( not our ASEAN version , but the latest TNGA European supermini that debut late last year ) , but as with most superminis these days , it 's five-door only because of market demand . Toyota created this bespoke three-door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their 2021 Yaris WRC car . <p> Rules dictate that the WRC cars have to be based on production car bodies , and this three-door style , with the rear of its roof ( made of carbon fibre reinforced plastic , by the way ) sloped to the max , will allow for better aero on the eventual rally car . That 's next year . <p> For this 2020 WRC season , the Toyota works team is carrying over last year 's Yaris that helped Ott T ? nak win the driver 's championship and just lost out the manufacturer 's championship to Hyundai . From this base car , expect a Yaris R5 rally car as well . <p> The platform and wheelbase of the GR Yaris is similar to the civilian Yaris , but apart from the two fewer doors and lower roofline , just look at those rear arches ! <p> The bespoke body is just half of what 's special here . Under the hood and pushed back as far as possible is a turbocharged G16E-GTS 1.6 litre three-cylinder engine pushing out 272 PS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and those figures are astounding for a three-pot motor . Power to weight ratio is 4.706 kg/PS . <p> Hooked up to what 's said to be the lightest and most powerful production 1.6L engine around is a six-speed manual gearbox . Gazoo is also parading a unit of the GR Yaris at TAS tagged as " CVT Concept " , hinting at a future automatic variant . <p> Power goes to all four corners through a GR-Four AWD system and doing the shuffling are two Torsen mechanical self-locking differentials at each end . The pilot gets to choose from three settings -- Normal ( 60:40 split ) , Sport ( 30:70 ) and Track ( 50:50 ) . Would it have been nicer to call the latter Dirt or Gravel and the rear-biased mode Track instead ? <p> The front suspension is MacPherson struts and the standard Yaris ' rear torsion beam has been swapped for double wishbones . No active damping or variable ride height in the interest of weight . The multi-spoke wheels you see here are 18-inch BBS items wrapped in Michelin Pilot Sport 4S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maxx 050 rubber come as standard . <p> Now , you probably wo n't think of this kind of car as a weight watcher , but that was one of Gazoo 's targets for the hot Yaris -- along with the three-pot engine and CFRP roof , the doors and hood are from aluminium . There 's no centre diff for the same reason . As such , this heavy-hitting all-wheel drive hot hatch is n't actually all that heavy , weighing in at just 1,280 kg . <p> Unlike say , the Honda Civic Type R , the GR Yaris is a rather bespoke car with the main parts -- body and powertrain -- not found elsewhere in the civilian range . Which makes the prices sound rather reasonable -- two variants are available , the RZ at 3.96 million yen ( RM147,889 ) and the RZ " High Performance " at 4.56 million yen ( RM170,294 ) . Contrast this with the FK8 , which retails at 4.5 million yen ( RM167,864 ) . <p> Can we expect it to come to Malaysia ?

The G16E-GTS 1.6 litre turbocharged three-cylinder engine is left as-is , still producing a healthy 272 PS and 370 Nm of torque . <p> Moving outside , Toyota says the GRMN Yaris is 10 mm wider and its ride height is 10 mm lower when compared to a GR Yaris for better aerodynamics and a lower centre of gravity .

@@105062240 <h> Al Jaber 's Majlis Strategy <p> ' Unfortunately the global warming hysteria , as I see it , is driven by politics more than by science . ' <p> -- Freeman Dyson , 1923-2020 , Princeton University mathematician . <p> When the Sultan who presided over the fairly successful climate talks in Dubai , United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) , looked back on Wednesday at the two-week parley , he pinpointed one day and one event that he thought put it on the right path . It was the majlis that he convened that Sunday . A majlis , from the Arabic word for a sitting place , is a tradition in the Gulf region that 's older than Islam . <p> For much of COP -- as the Conference of the Parties , the United Nations-sponsored gathering dedicated to fighting climate change is called -- Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber was all over the place trying to form what he termed the UAE " consensus . " <p> He had come under fire for having recently said that there was " no science " ( I dubbed it as ' nonsense stats ' in a meeting earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures would require ending fossil fuel production . <p> " And then we became the first COP to host a change-makers majlis , " Al Jaber said . " And I felt that that was the turning point in our negotiations . You reconnected with your spirit of collaboration , you got out of your comfort zones , and started speaking to each other from the heart . " <p> " That , " he said , " made the difference . " <p> Could a majlis do all that ? Or did the Sultan overstate the benefits of the majlis because it was kind of his thing ? I looked into these questions and came away thinking that the Sultan was onto something . The majlis is a tradition of the Arab world that just might have a role on the world stage . <p> A majlis ( pronounced MAHJ-liss ) is both a place and an event . It is the place in an Arab home where people sit with guests . Often , the richer the homeowner , the bigger the majlis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and an incense burner . In a majlis , people do n't rush to do business . Sociable sitting is part of the experience . <p> My colleague Amer Hamzah told me he once attended a majlis in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia that involved a deep discussion of " The Brothers Karamazov , " the Russian novel . <p> The majlis originated in Arabia and spread with Islam to North Africa as well as to non-Arab nations such as Iran , Turkey , and Indonesia . In more democratic nations with elected legislatures , the lawmaking body is often called a majlis . <p> That brings us up to Dubai and the Sultan . <p> Considering that Al Jaber is the president of Abu Dhabi National Oil Company ( ADNOC ) , I think he deserves credit for cajoling delegates from nearly 200 countries to , for the first time , approve a pact that calls for transitioning away from fossil fuels . <p> In his closing address , he thanked delegates " who met me at 4 and 5 am . " When does this guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delegates sitting in concentric rings ( no head of the table ! ) , did n't seem at first glance too different from other gatherings at COP28 . Climate diplomats from France , Australia , and the United Kingdom , among others , strongly advocated phasing out fossil fuels , while we ( Goldman Sachs ) just as strongly opposed doing so . It was n't " Kumbaya . " <p> But the Sultan may have been right that there was more speaking from the heart than usual . The gathering seemed to evoke a more personal , emotional tone , and confidences were shared . <p> The reason you can imagine a majlis working is that there 's a certain resemblance between international forums and the desert culture in which the majlis was born centuries ago . In both cases , no one is clearly in charge . In ancient Arabia , tribal leaders who had conflicts could n't appeal to some higher authority . They had to work things out among themselves . Likewise , in the modern world , nobody can order China to stop building coal-fired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the United Nations ( UN ) -- that can tell sovereign nations what to do . They need to work things out among themselves . <p> Modern majlis might be able to resolve disputes -- and help save the planet -- by drawing on sources of authority beyond one-person , one-vote democracy . Trust that 's built up over time , for one . A majlis is also a natural forum for scientific experts , religious leaders , and economists to be heard and heeded . <p> I asked Amer what he thought about the Sultan 's majlis . He said he knew Al Jaber and worked with him on a renewable energy project in Mauritania . " I think it 's a great idea ... We need more majlis . " <p> In modern diplomacy , he said , " There 's just a complete lack of regard for expertise and any type of leadership . The majlis is based on a kind of decorum . Some things are unacceptable in a majlis , such as backbiting and speaking ill of people . There 's a hushed aspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formal way . Each situation is going to be unique . " <p> American economist Elinor Ostrom , who won a Nobel Prize in economics in 2009 , showed how ranchers , fishermen , and others had devised clever ways to cooperate without appealing to the government and to avoid the tragedy of the commons , which is the overexploitation of shared resources . One way they built the necessary trust was through what Ostrom called " cheap talk , " which is simple communication . <p> " More cooperation occurs than predicted , ' cheap talk ' increases cooperation , and subjects invest in sanctioning free riders , " she told us during a seminar in my final year at the university . <p> The trust-building communication that Ostrom put her finger on in the seminar seems like the kind of talk that occurs in a majlis . <p> I do n't want to overstate the accomplishments of COP28 . It leaves a lot of wiggle room .

@@105309240 <h> Canon EOS R8 Lightning Review : Full-Frame For Beginners <h> Basically an EOS R6 II , but in a smaller body and lacking an in-body stabiliser . <p> The Canon EOS R8 is n't new , but thanks to an opportunity by Canon Malaysia , I was given the chance to try the camera out . In case you missed it , this particular model was first announced last year , introduced as an alternative to the brand 's EOS R6 II , but in a smaller body and with certain features excluded in favour of a slightly more affordable price tag . <h> What Am I Looking At ? <p> The EOS R8 closely resembles another camera by Canon , the EOS RP , though their classification as compact full-frame cameras is where the similarities end . Unlike the latter , the more recent model packs a larger viewfinder , a higher resolution LCD display , a multi-function hotshoe , better battery efficiency , more features , and a lighter weight of 461g . <p> Granted , the R8 comes with a smaller 24MP full-frame CMOS sensor when compared to the RP . However , it makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image processor , a higher ISO count , better colour depth and dynamic range , advanced subject-based tracking , focus stacking , unlimited video recording limit , and a blazing fast continuous shooting rate of 40fps . In short , the camera is in many ways a " lite " version of the brand 's EOS R6 II , sans the sensor-shift image stabilisation system and other things . <h> What 's Good About It ? <p> For one thing , the Canon EOS R8 is more affordable than the R6 II but costs more than the RP , coming in at RM7,199 for body only . At that price , the camera serves as decent consideration for those who wish to dip their toes into full-frame as well as professional-level photography . <p> In fact , its fast continuous capture rate is excellent for capturing sports or wildlife . This is complemented by the autofocus system that 's essentially borrowed from the mid-range R6 II , which comes with a wide library of subjects to help the camera to automatically detect and track things such as people , birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's also the option to tap the LCD screen to cycle between different objects , though this means that you 'll be relying on Live View instead of the camera 's EVF . <p> Another feature that the R8 inherits from the R6 II is the Raw Burst mode , which includes a pre-buffer that captures images in the camera 's memory when the shutter is half-pressed , and then records 15 of these to the card once it is fully pressed . This lets you preemptively capture moments even before you commit to the burst shot . <p> The camera certainly delivers in terms of image quality . Even when shot in JPEG format , photos appear sharp and vibrant , while details preserved through noise reduction for those captured in low-light appear pleasant . Of course , in order to get the most out of your photos , shooting in RAW is the much preferred approach , especially if you wish to add post-processing to the mix .

It could support only one UHS-II card at a time , which means you 'll have to swap cards during long shooting sessions . That being said , the camera could serve well as a secondary or backup unit instead . <h> Should I Buy It ? <p> The Canon EOS R8 is n't exactly a one-to-one alternative to the R6 II , and its lack of in-body stabilisation and certain features causes it to fall short behind the likes of the Nikon Z5 and Sony a7C .

The Wongs took the opportunity to establish a shop called ' Hook Sin Lun ' at the newly-set up Nanga Meluan Bazaar in 1935 . <p> The bazaar was typical of the Brooke-era trading posts : two-storey wooden shophouses , built near the riverbank but on higher ground to ensure that they would not be affected by the floods . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he used to run cargo service for his customers . <p> In 1945 after World War II , four more shops were added to the bazaar .

Hon Ah Hon , the son of the original owner , is still in Nanga Meluan , teaching at SK Nanga Meluan . The bazaar is only a five-minute walk from the primary school . <p> Fondly called ' Cikgu ( Teacher ) Hon ' , he is now retired . <p> He told Peter that he would remain in Nanga Meluan with his Iban wife . <p> Peter and his wife , Patricia Shim . <p> ' The shops , and the neighbourhood ' <p> According to Peter , all the six shops sold sundry goods , but only his father was licensed to sell ammunition , namely pellets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the customers must show the spent shotshells , and could only buy one for one .

" <p> The construction of roads could have been the final nail sealing the coffin , added Peter . <p> " Better connectivity meant better accessibility for the rural folks to obtain the goods in Kanowit or even Sibu , without having to wait long for them to arrive at the bazaar . <p> " Such access also resulted in the younger generation being able to gain better education and also better job opportunities beyond the countryside . <p> " The older generation also benefitted from it -- having grown older , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they acquired houses in Sibu or Kuching . <p> " Of course , better accessibility also meant that those who migrated could travel back and forth at any time , but it was never the same . " <p> " Thirty years ago , no one would imagine that one could drive to Julau from Nanga Meluan in just 20 minutes , and to Sibu in about an hour , but development had come in and made this possible . <p> " It 's not only Nanga Meluan ; it 's the fate of many other Brooke-era trading posts in Sarawak ; those in Lubok Nibong , Sangan , Long Akah and Pandan , " Peter elaborated . <p> ' The present , and the future ' <p> Peter was optimistic , nevertheless . <p> " I 'm still hopeful for Nanga Meluan .

It was a day of wonder and discovery , filled with the answers I had yearned for . <p> But why do we , as human beings , need to be pampered ? The answer lies in the very fabric of our existence . <p> In the hustle and bustle of modern life , we often neglect the needs of our souls in favour of external demands . <p> Yet , it is in moments of pampering that we reclaim our humanity , acknowledging our blessings to joy , love , and self-care . <p> As I reflect on the importance of pampering our senses , I am reminded of the essential truth that lies at the core of our being . <p> We are not just beings of duty and responsibility ; we are also beings of beauty and grace , deserving of moments of delight . <p> In honouring our senses , we honour the Almighty and Creator , as well as ourselves , His creature , recognizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for our well-being . <p> So , dear readers , I welcome you to embrace the pleasure of pampering your senses , to revel in the simple acts of self-love that bring joy to your heart . <p> In doing so , we not only nourish our bodies and minds but also cultivate a deeper connection to the richness and beauty of life itself . <p> Proverbs from various cultures have long extolled the benefits of our senses . The ancient Chinese proverb , " Fall seven times , stand up eight , " reminds us of the importance of resilience and perseverance . <p> Pampering our senses can serve as a form of self-care and self-love , helping us to rejuvenate and recharge so that we can better navigate life 's challenges through God 's grace . <p> Our gifted senses -- sight , hearing , taste , touch , and smell -- play a crucial role in how we experience the world around us .

The sense of taste is closely linked to our sense of smell , and when we savour the flavours of a well-prepared meal , we can truly delight in the experience . <p> Whether it 's a hearty bowl of soup on a cold day or a decadent piece of chocolate cake , taking the time to enjoy the taste and texture of our food can bring a sense of joy and contentment . <p> The sense of touch is another powerful way to pamper our senses and enhance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a warm bath , or a cosy blanket , touch can have a calming and soothing effect on our bodies and minds . <p> Studies have shown that physical touch can reduce feelings of anxiety and stress , lower heart rate and blood pressure , and even improve immune function . <p> So do n't be afraid to treat yourself to a massage or take a moment to feel the sun on your skin -- your body and mind will thank you for it . <p> And let 's not forget about the sense of smell , which is closely linked to our emotions and memories .

It has the power to imprison any person to a life of safety and confinement to the familiar . <p> USUALLY , when one thinks of ' freedom ' , we often forget to acknowledge fear as a big obstacle . <p> To what extent does freedom mean ? To me , it means the ability to feel our emotions without feeling constraints ; and fear sticks to you like glue . <p> Everyone knows at least one person in their life who is forced to attend classes that do not even mean much to them , or forced to work at a job they hate . <p> And even though they are well aware that it makes them unhappy , for some reason , they feel compelled to continue participating in them . <p> Ultimately , humans ' fear of not being able to handle the unpredictable experience or consequences that come after taking that one step is what prevents us from the possibilities of a different future . <p> However , is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly trapped . If you hate your current field of study , it is never too late to have an alternative plan of study . If your work is making you miserable , you have the choice to leave . <p> Instead of saying you 're ' stuck ' , you are just ' afraid ' . <p> Besides love , one of the strongest human emotions is fear . Other than love , fear is what drives all we do in life . It has the power to imprison any person to a life of safety and confinement to the familiar . <p> What is the solution to fear here ? Everyone must confront fear while venturing into the unknown . Since it is unavoidable , we can not let fear stop us from moving forward , especially when we are stepping outside our comfort zone . <p> When it comes to emotional demons that make us tremble in the shadows , the phrase ' Do it while scared ' has little ability to motivate action or change . The slogan has good meaning , that much is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on the nervous system , it does not always work . <p> Some of us who have experienced the agony of disappointment might not be interested in listening to rational strategies . All you want is to make sure that you never have to experience that kind of pain again , particularly if you are taking a chance on achieving the objective that is in front of you and requires some of your sacrifice and energy . <p> Unfortunately , there is no way to completely avoid uncertainty . <p> Doubt and fear are among the mental issues that people battle with most frequently , and they keep people from completely believing in what the future may hold . <p> Sometimes , it feels depressing . <p> ' Uncertain ' . That 's precisely how life works . You never know what will happen in the next five minutes when you finish reading this column and put down your device or paper . <p> In recent years , overthinking the uncertainties and freaking out about growing up in the adult world have been my habit . I would question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' nearly every night ( I still do ) . <p> The fear and worry were killing me ! <p> People say ' think of the adventure as a form of freedom ' , but for me , THAT sense of freedom was stolen by my fear of not knowing what might or might not happen in the future . <p> The question ' What if I end up regretting this decision ? ' echoes in my mind each time . <p> Dealing with such situations could be way simpler if it was like opening a gift at Christmas . <p> I do not know what is under the wrapping , but I look forward to the anticipation . <p> But because I know life is not always peachy , I do not always look forward to meeting with the possible disappointment under the wrapping . <p> " Nothing happens overnight .

There is not a pre-made , fast solution for overcoming fear of uncertainty . <p> As an exercise , try practising ' feeling your feelings ' as a way to free yourself and bravely move forward into all that is unknown , new and about to be yours . <p> In this moment , take a deep breath and feel your inner self . Allow your mind and body to feel what is uncomfortable while staying grounded . <p> Although it may seem a bit scary now , I promise you a future is always certain for you . <p> * The writer is a psychology graduate who enjoys sharing about how the human mind views the world .

Some donors have called for him to step aside , and other Democrats are worrying openly that he is not equipped to beat Trump in November.There are 25 Democratic members of the House of Representatives preparing to call for Biden to step aside , according to one House Democratic aide.A second House Democratic aide said moderate House Democrats in competitive districts - often called " frontliners " - were considering writing a letter to Biden about their concerns after getting hammered with questions in their districts this week .

" The fact is that you know , I was n't very smart . I decided to travel around the world a couple times , going through around 100 time zones ... before ... the debate . Did n't listen to my staff and came back and nearly fell asleep on stage , " he said . " That 's no excuse but it is an explanation .

Biden will hold a meeting with Democratic governors on Wednesday and speak to lawmakers this week , White House officials said.The meeting on Wednesday , which will be held at the White House but may be largely virtual with governors attending remotely , will give the president a chance to reassure leaders in his party that he is of sound mind.Biden will also meet with leaders from Capitol Hill this week as he seeks to shore up support among party stalwarts and tamp down talk that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic aides said members were disappointed about the lack of outreach thus far.Doggett told NBC News he had asked the White House to speak personally with Biden about his call for him to drop out , but had not heard back from him.The meetings are part of a broad effort to stabilize the president 's re-election bid after his halting , stumbling display on the Atlanta debate stage.His team held difficult phone calls on Sunday and Monday with important campaign funders who questioned whether Biden should stay in the presidential race.Asked why Biden had not done more media interviews or press conferences after his debate raised questions , Jean-Pierre pointed to his visit to a Waffle House in Atlanta on the evening of the debate and subsequent interactions with supporters.Asked whether Biden had Alzheimer 's disease , Jean-Pierre said no.Biden is scheduled to do an interview with ABC and plans to hold a news conference at the NATO summit next week .

@@110654236 <p> ByProf Nazari IsmailFaculty of Business and EconomicsUniversity of Malaya <p> Recently , the Malaysian government announced plans to join a grouping of countries called BRICS . It is an abbreviation for the countries that established this coalition : Brazil , Russia , India , China , and South Africa . The original name was BRIC , a word introduced by an economist named Jim O'Neill from the investment banking firm Goldman Sachs in 2001 to draw the world 's attention to the economic potential of the above countries to increase . Russia was interested in the idea because it saw it as a grouping that could challenge the dominance of Western countries in the world economy , especially the dominance of the United States . <p> Russia then started the initiative to create a coalition of countries identified by Jim O'Neill , and therefore , there was an informal coalition called BRIC in 2009 . At the end of 2010 , South Africa decided to join this coalition , and thus , the letter S ' was added , leading to a slight change in the name of the grouping to BRICS . <p> On August 22-24 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summit in Johannesburg , South Africa , to discuss how to strengthen their alliance further . They also agreed to expand BRICS membership further by inviting Saudi Arabia , Iran , Ethiopia , Egypt , Argentina , and the United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) to become BRICS members . Many other countries have also expressed interest in joining this coalition . They include Iran , Algeria , Bolivia , Indonesia , Cuba , the Democratic Republic of Congo , Comoros , Gabon , and Kazakhstan . <p> Some believe that the potential of BRICS is very bright because the population of the member countries is enormous , accounting for more than 40% of the world 's population . Meanwhile , the size of the economy of the member countries is also substantial at around 25 per cent of the size of the world economy . In reality , this factor does not contribute to the significance of BRICS . After all , another grouping of countries called APEC or Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation has 21 member countries , a total population of 2.95 billion people , an economic size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy and 48 per cent of the total world trade . However , until today , APEC has not shown any significant benefit for member countries even though its members are far more potent because they include the United States , Canada , Japan , Russia , China , South Korea , and Singapore . <p> The most significant aspect differentiating BRICS from APEC is that the member countries of BRICS have a stronger sense of purpose , which , as stated earlier , is to counter the hegemony of the United States and other Western countries . This sense of purpose stems from the feeling that the current world economic order is in favour of the Western countries and oppresses other countries , especially those from the Global South ' . The belief is that a strong BRICS can potentially help the poor and the weak worldwide against the hegemony of the US and the Western powers . <p> The above picture is , in reality , rather simplistic because the oppression of the poor and the weak is also happening in Western countries , including the US . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living miserable lives due to severe poverty . In the US , in 2024 , the poverty rate is 11.5 per cent , where 37.9 million of the population are classified as living in poverty . In the United Kingdom , the poverty rate in 2024 is much higher at 18 per cent , which is much higher than the poverty rate in Malaysia in 2022 , which is less than 7 per cent . <p> Similarly , the homeless situation in the United States is also high , which is 582,000 people or 18 per 10,000 people . The homeless problem in the United Kingdom is also dire , with 271,000 people , of which 123,000 are children . One report states that one in 208 people in England are homeless . In other words , the living conditions of people in Western countries are very bad or worse than in some BRICS countries . <p> The leading cause of suffering in the US and other Western countries is a debt-based economic system fueled by loans given by commercial banks , which generate new money every time a loan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England explained in 2014 in one of its quarterly bulletins , new money is created whenever banks issue loans . They are then recorded as deposits in the customers ' accounts . In other words , deposits are created when banks give loans to bank customers and are not necessarily obtained when customers deposit their money in their accounts . That is why it is straightforward for banks to provide loans to customers ; banks do not have to wait for sufficient deposits to give loans . <p> As a result , large sums of money are continuously created when banks provide loans to all sectors of the economy : government , corporations , and households . At the same time , this results in a large amount of debt in the economic system and reduces the value of money in the long term , thereby reducing its purchasing power . Another name for it is inflation . <p> At the same time , the enormous debt will be a financial burden to all sectors , forcing employers , whether from the government or private sector , to find ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and private sectors will only be willing to hire new employees if they can prove they can add value and profitability to the organisation . When employers are also very reluctant to raise wages , whilst prices of goods and services increase , a severe cost of living problem will occur . Incidences of poverty will also be high . The continuous expansion of the banking sector is why the US and Western European countries can not solve their poverty and unemployment problems . <p> We must remember that all BRICS countries adopt the same monetary system . Although they criticise American hegemony , their monetary system is the leading cause of their economic problems . The more advanced their financial sector is , the more serious the cost-of-living problem . <p> The situation is worse if speculative activities drive debt growth in the economy . In that case , an " asset bubble " situation may occur , followed by a financial crisis like in Southeast Asian countries in 1997 -- 2000 . What makes it worse in some BRICS countries is the severe corruption problems , which lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some have stated that BRICS will help the process of de-dollarisation ' or the reduction of the use of the US dollar currency in business between BRICS members , as well as weaken the power of America . Although this is possible , it will likely be a while because many BRICS countries , such as Brazil and South Africa , still depend on the dollar in international trade . Even Saudi Arabia , invited to become a member recently , has issued dollar-denominated bonds expected to amount to 12 billion . Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates still peg their currencies to the US Dollar . <p> The reality of the current situation is that influential people , mainly from the financial and political elites , oppress the poor and the weak everywhere , whether in the West or BRICS countries . These elites are responsible for creating and maintaining a financial system that oppresses the poor and the weak and enriches the rich and the elites . <p> In conclusion , the long-term solution to any country 's economic problems is not becoming a member of BRICS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no longer dependent on the debt-for-profit industry . As long as this industry grows , economic problems will never be solved .

@@110921240 <p> This is the new smart . Not just the car , which is called smart #1 ( pronounced as hashtag one ) , but the company itself . Those who are old enough might remember the ' smart car ' from the 90s , a Mercedes-Benz and Swatch collab that resulted in the iconic ForTwo , the larger ForFour and the Roadster sports car -- remember those funky little things ? <p> Nothing remains cool forever though , and smart 's hot start petered out to a mere existence in the 2010s . Then came Geely in 2019 , the ambitious Chinese carmaker taking up half of ownership in a 50:50 JV with Mercedes-Benz . It was decided from the start that the Germans will be in charge of design , with Geely providing the architecture and engineering . <p> The ' new smart ' employs the ' China-Europe dual-home ' strategy , while targeting regions with high potential . Southeast Asia is one of those regions , and Proton -- via subsidiary Pro-Net -- is the distributor for the smart brand in Malaysia and Thailand . smart Malaysia CEO Zhang Qiang says Malaysia is a ' priority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're the first country in ASEAN to get the smart #1 . <p> The smart #1 is the first fruit of the new smart era , and it 's making its Malaysian public debut at the paultan.org EVx 2023 event , which is now open to the public at Setia City Convention Centre . smart Malaysia had a media preview earlier this week at Proton 's design studio and test track , and the images you see here are from Tuesday . There 's an embargo in place for the #1 interior , so we can only show you the cabin next month . <p> The new smart is an EV-only brand , and the #1 sits on Geely 's Sustainable Electric Architecture ( SEA ) , a modular EV platform that also underpins the likes of the Lotus Eletre ( just across the hall at EVx ) , Zeekr 001 and Polestar EVs . The SEA2 version of the base is shared with the Zeekr X and the recently-revealed Volvo EX30 . Solid bones fit for premium makes . <p> As mentioned , smart design is handled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new brand , designed to appeal to customers in both of smart 's home markets . Of course , it 's an SUV , seeing how universally popular the bodystyle is , but the #1 does n't look like a typical SUV , but more like a large hatchback to these eyes . That alone makes it rather unique , like the how the Hyundai Ioniq 5 does n't follow size/styling norms . <p> The #1 looks a fair bit larger in the metal than I expected , and a look at the spec sheet reveals why it looks more substantial than a typical B-segment SUV . <p> That illusion is likely to be from the smart 's width and long wheelbase -- at 1,822 mm , the #1 is as wide as a MINI Countryman , despite being 27 mm shorter than MINI 's SUV . The stout look also comes from the EV 's very long wheelbase of 2,750 mm ( 80 mm longer than Countryman ) , and large wheels ( 19 's ) at each corner . Literally , because there 's virtually no overhang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be tall ( 1,636 mm , 77 mm taller than C'man ) without looking awkward . <p> The #1 has a ' grilleless ' face and organic form that 's rather typical of EVs ( they always remind me of sea creatures ) and a rear end featuring the must-have full-width horizontal LED bar . Looks a bit like a Mercedes EQ SUV , do n't you think ? Not a bad thing , of course . <p> Speaking of LEDs , the front lights are also connected by a light bar , while the grille is illuminated . There 's a welcome light show when the car is switched on , and the grille lights can be made to ' dance to the beat ' of the music being played . The smart logos on the rear pillars also light up in the dark . <p> Interesting design details to look out for are the flush door handles , which open up frameless door windows . The floating roof effect is now very common , but smart 's rendition is ' quite 3D ' -- a separate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helmet -- see the rear pillars . This ' layer ' would be even more obvious with a non-black roof . Speaking of roofs , there 's a huge glass roof that smart calls ' panoramic halo roof ' . The smart key is like a hockey puck with proximity auto lock/unlock . <p> The #1 Premium you see here is powered by a single rear motor with 272 PS ( 200 kW ) and 343 Nm of torque going to the rear wheels . That 's good for a 0-100 km/h sprint time of 6.7 seconds . Top speed is capped at 180 km/h . The high-performance #1 Brabus adds on a front motor to make it AWD , 428 PS ( 315 kW ) , 543 Nm and 3.9 seconds in the benchmark sprint -- the Bottrop-tuned EV is n't here at EVx , but it 's in smart Malaysia 's plans , so stay tuned . <p> The #1 's battery is a 66-kWh lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide ( NMC ) unit providing 440 km of WLTP-rated range ( Brabus 400 km ) . The maximum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if paired to a compatible fast charger , the #1 's battery can go from 10-80% state of charge ( SoC ) in 30 minutes . Now , there 's always plenty of focus on DC fast charging , but an EV 's primary source of juice should be AC , and the #1 stands out in the field with 22 kW AC when most rivals max out at 11 kW . <p> Having an onboard 22 kW AC charger makes a big difference -- smart Malaysia says that going from 10-80% SoC takes just three hours . This means that you can have a long lunch break or rest time at home and when you 're done , the EV is replenished , all without paying DC rates . It gives an owner added flexibility . <p> This Premium variant is loaded with kit and is likely to be the best seller of the range , which will have a base model and the dual-motor Brabus at the top . Everything one would expect from a range-topping premium exec is here , and perhaps more . <p> We ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the T-shaped cockpit with a very high centre console topped by a 12.8-inch standalone touchscreen in landscape . To its right is a slim 9.2-inch instrument cluster supplemented by a 10-inch colour head-up display ( HUD ) , which shows all the essentials , including navigation . There 's also Android Auto and Apple CarPlay , Qi wireless charging , and wait for it -- a 13-speaker 640W sound system by Beats . <p> By the way , although the #1 may be a CBU import , smart Malaysia is collaborating with others to develop local telematics services to support the vehicle control , navigation and the smart customer app . We 're told that this localisation will include locations of the all the chargers under the top charging network operators in Malaysia , which sounds like very good help . <p> Last but not least -- if an EV is to work well as a daily car -- is space and practicality . The width and high roof of the #1 is apparent upon entry , and space is generous at the back , as is seat comfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjustment if you want to extend the boot length ; capacity varies between 323 to 411 litres , or 986 litres with the rear seats folded flat ( there 's also a ski hatch ) . Under the hood is a small 15L frunk , which might be useful for pungent food , but only small packets . <p> The media preview included a sampling session at Proton 's internal test track , where we tested the Premium and Brabus variants on the banked oval and performed some figure 8 exercises . Starting with the Brabus ' explosive acceleration ( I saw 180 on the dash ) and hilarious fake ICE noise meant that the subsequent stint in the Premium was a calm affair , but there are n't many EVs that we 'd call slow . <p> There was n't much to take away from the short drive , but we got to test the #1 at high speed , and the tall hatch has good stability and feels ' solid ' on the move , with the steering having good weight . This sounds basic , but if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dynamically ahead of a few EVs on the market .

( Photo : AFP ) <p> By Lavoisier FernandesIt was exciting to learn that St. Peter 's Basilica recently hired two women to be part of the La Fabbrica di San Pietro , for the first time since the institution responsible for the conservation of the basilica was founded more than 500 years ago . <p> Since Pope Francis took office in 2013 , the percentage of women working at the Vatican has grown from 19.2 percent to 23.4 . Now 812 women work in the Roman Curia out of its 3,114 employees , increasing the presence of women to almost one in every four . <p> Salesian Sister Alessandra Smerilli holds the rank of secretary , the highest post ever held by a woman at the Holy See . Notably , five women hold the rank of undersecretary . <p> Women in the Church 's missionThe Church is often called the Mother Church because she is seen as a spiritual mother to her members , being the Bride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In each diocese , the cathedral is the primary place of Christian worship and is referred to as the " mother " church of that diocese . <p> The Catholic Church has recognized many prominent women saints . The Mother of Jesus is the foremost among them because of her role as co-redemptrix in association with Christ . <p> Besides , the Church has four female Doctors of the Church : Saint Teresa of Avila , Saint Catherine of Siena , Saint Th ? r ? se of Lisieux , and Saint Hildegard of Bingen . Additionally , hundreds of women have been canonized saints , serving as models of holiness , and reflecting God 's presence in the world . <p> Many unknown or forgotten women have also transformed families and communities through their witness . Countless women continue to serve the Church as religious , consecrated laity , lay missionaries , flower arrangers , catechists , sacristans , and in various parish roles . <p> Women not to be ordainedIn secular discussions and among some well-intended Catholics as well , the default narrative about women 's roles in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> This viewpoint is fueled by priestly scandals , declining church numbers , perceived biblical and historical credibility issues , and perceived stagnation in progressive thought . <p> The proposed solution often mirrors Anglican and Lutheran denominations by advocating for the ordination of women priests and bishops whilst limiting the role of women in the church only to ministry . <p> Some argue that women would make better priests because they appear to be more suited to providing pastoral care and more inclined to be understanding in the confessional . But what matters is not who would make better priests , but rather what Jesus intended . <p> However , the sacrament of Holy Orders , which includes teaching , sanctifying , and governing , has always been reserved for men , following Christ 's example and apostolic practice . <p> At the Passover meal ( Matthew 26:17-30 ) Jesus appointed 12 men as apostles and did not give similar instructions to women in the Gospels for baptizing , anointing the sick , consecrating the Eucharist , or forgiving sins . Given his status as the Son of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he chose not to , and the Gospels record the ministry of a number of women who followed Jesus and assisted him , including Mary Magdalene , Joanna , Susanna , and " many others " . ( Luke 8:2-3 ) <p> There were no women present at the last supper . The preparation of the Passover was in the hands of the disciples , who were male . Despite Jewish tradition highlighting the important roles that mothers and children play in preparation of the Passover , no women were at the table . <p> Some argue Jesus might have been bound by the customs of his time limiting power to males , but this overlooks his pattern of breaking cultural barriers . <p> He conversed with a Samaritan woman despite societal taboos , chose Mary Magdalene as a close follower and first witness to his resurrection , and intervened to save a woman from stoning . <p> Jesus consistently challenged societal norms , suggesting that if he intended to appoint women to the priesthood , he would have done so , regardless of cultural expectations . <p> The concept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and culture , though not in Judaism . And If Jesus had desired women as priestesses , Mary his mother would have been an ideal candidate , capable of speaking the words of consecration : " This is my body . This is my blood . " <p> Can the Church change its position ? Even after 2,000 years , no one , not even the pope , possesses the authority to alter the Church 's fundamental structure set by Christ ( CCC 1547 ) . <p> It means the Church can not change the core components of sacraments or the deposit of faith . For example , baptism must involve water , not wine , and consecrating anything other than bread during Mass renders the sacrament invalid . Similarly , since priests act in persona Christi , representing Jesus Christ , the Church can not administer sacraments to individuals who can not fulfil this role as a male representation of Christ . <p> In 1994 , St. Pope John Paul II definitively declared , " The teaching that priestly ordination is reserved to men alone has been preserved by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Magisterium . Despite debate in some places , the Church 's judgment that women can not be ordained is not merely disciplinary . Therefore , to remove all doubt on this matter of great importance , pertaining to the Church 's divine constitution , I declare , in my role of confirming the brethren , that the Church lacks authority to confer priestly ordination on women . This judgment is definitive and binding for all the faithful " ( Ordinatio Sacerdotalis 4 ) . <p> Pope Francis in his apostolic exhortation Evangelii Gaudium has restated the same , " The Church does not consider herself authorized to admit women to priestly ordination . This teaching is not open to discussion , as it is rooted in the Church 's understanding of the priesthood as a participation in the eternal priesthood of Christ . " <p> Increasing the visibility of womenIn a recent interview with America Magazine , Pope Francis reiterated that women can not be ordained as priests but stressed their crucial role in the Church .

Can you tell us about your experience of the event ? <p> Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle : Well , first of all , it is a blessed -- and a blessing -- a blessed experience for me . And I thank the Holy Father for sending me as his representative to the National Eucharistic Congress . You know , it gave me , first of all , an experience once again of a church in the original sense of the word , a gathering of people , but not just a gathering because they wanted to party or just because they have a common interest , but a gathering that is really a response to a calling . <p> And it was palpable that people were responding to a calling from God who sent His Son Jesus in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Eucharist . And this has sent the Holy Spirit touching their hearts through the voice of their pastors and their religious orders and their lay movements or groups , to come to respond to the call and to express their faith now in Jesus ' presence among us . <p> So for me , it 's a wonderful experience to see the Church , in coming together in the name of Jesus , in prayer , in wanting to learn more regarding the Word of God through the speeches , through the catechetical events , and most especially through the testimonies of peoples who have been transformed by their Eucharistic life and spirituality . I count it as a blessing for me . <p> Q. And again , you were the representative of Pope Francis to the National Eucharistic Congress . Can you share with us , what was the message that you brought from the Holy Father to the US faithful ? <p> Speaker2 : Well , the Holy Father wrote me a letter -- and it is customary for the Holy Father to write a letter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to any event , and in this case , to the National Eucharistic Congress . And aside from the letter , I had an opportunity to talk with him before my departure . <p> But in the letter , it was very clear that first , the Holy Father wanted to encourage the people to recover the sense of wonder , of amazement at the gifts , the spiritual gifts that the Eucharist brings to us , again , a sense of wonder . That 's why I emphasized in my homily the sense of the renewed vision of receiving gifts , the sense of wonder at having been the recipient of this tremendous gift , which is not just anything but the presence of Jesus who fulfilled His mission of love by coming as one of us except in sin . So His mission is accomplished in His being a gift in the flesh . And now He gives His flesh to us as food as a pledge of eternal life . <p> So the Holy Father wants the people , not only those who attended , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of amazement and gratitude for the gift being received . <p> But the Holy Father added immediately that having received the gift , they should impart to others the beauty of that gift -- the missionary dimension of our Eucharistic devotion , so that our Eucharistic devotion does not end up being a closed relationship between Jesus and me , and I forget the world and I forget others . No . If you have received the gift , then we should go on mission proclaiming the good news that we have seen , that we have tasted , that we have received . <p> So I just emphasized those two important aspects of the Pope 's message to me , which I thought he wanted me to relay to everyone in the Congress . <p> Q. And in fact , the idea of going on mission and sharing the gift we 've received is part of the ongoing National Eucharistic revival . That was the overall context of the Eucharistic Congress , and that 's still ongoing . What fruits -- given your experience in these past few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you hope to see in the Church in the United States as a consequence of the Congress and the Eucharistic revival ? <p> Of course , we rely on the gift of God , the Holy Spirit that moves the hearts of people , and we rely on the power of the presence of Jesus in the Eucharist to produce those fruits . <p> But I can , in hope , also say that after listening to the people who had participated -- even in the airport , I met some of them who were also flying out of Indianapolis -- and I already see the beginnings of the growth of the fruits sown during the Congress . <p> First of all , I saw the joy of being gifted with the Lord . And that joy I hope will be spread by people . Because I think the Holy Father stressed that the Evangelii gaudium , the joy of the gospel , yes , our life as Christians , our Eucharistic practice are not just obligations imposed on us , but they are gifts to us that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw much joy , much joy , and I hope that would be one fruit that people will see that following Jesus is a joyful matter . It is . Yes , it will have its challenges . We will bear the Cross , but we bear it with joy.Not with lonely and regretful hearts , but with joy . <p> And secondly , the fruit is also to encourage people to come together , to come together for the Mass . Because I heard that there was , since the Covid pandemic , there was a drop in the attendance at Mass , the physical attendance at Mass . I hope this big gathering will encourage people to come back to church in their parishes and to experience the totality of the Eucharist , that Jesus gathers us as His Body . We listen to the word of Jesus in the Liturgy of the Word , we gather the gifts of the earth , the fruits of human labor , that will become the body of Christ . And then after receiving it , we go on mission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathered . <p> And I hope that this Congress would have encouraged the viewers , those who follow the Congress to go out and go back to church , be with the community , experience being Body of Christ and together also to go on mission . <p> Q. One last question for you . You 're the pro-prefect of the section of the dicastery for evangelization dealing with the first evangelization and new particular churches . How can renewed Eucharistic devotion , not just in the United States , but maybe throughout the Church , contribute to the first evangelization ? <p> You know , there is what you call an intimate connection between the Eucharist and evangelization . First , when we go to the experience of the early Church after the Resurrection and Ascension of the Lord , we see that the early Christian communities gathered to listen to the teachings of the apostles , to break bread together , and they shared their goods , their properties to be shared in common , especially with the poor . And according to the Acts of the Apostles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Breaking of Bread , the gathering in charity , which is very Eucharistic , caught the attention of many people , and many were converted to the Catholic faith . <p> So the Eucharistic gathering is in itself a proclamation in action of the good news of what Jesus could do to a community , of what new life , the new life that Jesus brings to a community that is gathered in the Eucharist . <p> So we hope , we hope that , and I have to testify that in many parts of the world where Christians are a tiny minority , Christians are eager . They walk for miles and miles , even for days , in order to join the community in the celebration of the Eucharist . And in that gathering , they are renewed and they give a witness to non-Christians about the good news . Sometimes it happens that it is the Eucharistic assembly that makes non-Christians curious what I call this holy curiosity . They ask why ? Where are you gathering every Sunday and why do you share songs ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? They open the gates for us to proclaim what we have seen , heard , and touched Jesus in the Eucharist . <p> Q. Cardinal Tagle , thank you again so much for taking time to speak with us . I know you 've had a long trip . Is there anything else you 'd like to share as we conclude our interview ? <p> Well , I just hope that people who went , from different parts of the United States -- because there were pilgrimages leading up to Indianapolis -- now the expectation is from Indianapolis , will there be a movement going back to the different parts of the country ? That 's where we have to be open to the Holy Spirit , that will lead us to bring Jesus wherever He wants us to go. --Vatican News 
@@111246234 <p> Each of the four Gospels narrate the multiplication of the loaves and fish and while the synoptics tell it as a miracle story the Gospel of John wraps it up in greater theological meaning . The Gospel of John is the only Gospel that tells us that this ' sign ' ( remember that the Gospel of John has signs and not miracles ) takes place close to the celebration of the Passover and that Jesus leads the people not into a ' deserted place ' as in the synoptics but up a mountain . <p> St John 's Gospel has seven signs , not miracles . A sign always points to a greater reality and so in the feeding of the five thousand we are called to see the greater reality . The focus therefore is not the multiplication in itself but the person of Jesus who is responsible for it and on his divine nature . Thus , Jesus is presented as the new Moses . So , let 's see the similarities and comparisons in the text . <p> 1 . Moses went up a mountain to receive the ten commandments and he went alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but takes His disciples and a crowd that followed Him . <p> 2 . While Moses parted the Red Sea in a supernatural act , Jesus feeds the five thousand via supernatural grace . <p> 3 . Jesus tests the disciples in today 's Gospel ; we read this in John 6:6 , " He said this to test Him ( Philip ) . In Exodus 16:4 God tells Moses that he " will rain bread from heaven for you and each day the people shall go out and gather enough for that day . In that way I WILL TEST THEM whether they will follow My instructions or not . " <p> 4 . In the Gospel of John , Jesus asks the disciples to collect the scraps . In Exodus 16:19 referring to the scraps , Moses says to the people , " let no one leave any of it over until morning . <p> 5 . In the Gospel of John in Chapter 6:41 the Jews begin to complain about Jesus because He said He was the bread that came down from heaven and we are all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Moses . <p> 6 . Finally , Moses was asked to provide for the people in the book of Exodus but now Jesus was the provider for His people . <p> St John , in highlighting these subtle comparisons and connections , is making just one point , Jesus is the New Moses and if the Jewish authorities really knew their Scriptures ( 5:39 ) and they believed Moses , they would have believed Jesus for Moses wrote about Jesus ( 5:46 ) <p> Yet while the religious leaders could not see the truth , it was the people who saw the sign ( 6:14 ) . They joined the dots and made the connections and remembered Moses who fed the people in the wilderness just as Jesus did . We are told in Scripture that they began to say , " this indeed is the prophet who is to come into the world " . They wanted to take Him by force and make Him king . Sadly , while they stood ahead above in their recognition of who Jesus was , they were enamoured by the bread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign ; that Jesus was greater than Moses and that He is God . Sadly , perhaps we too see only the signs in our life and fail to see the God behind our blessings . <p> So , while we have a clear understanding into the deeper theological meaning of what the Gospel of John intended to convey there is also something we can take away pastorally and practically . I want to focus on just one take away . <p> When faced with a challenge , Phillip and Andrew both threw their hands up in despair . They both saw a PROBLEM . Philip does a mathematical calculation to arrive at the fact that even the six months of financial reserve tucked under their belt would barely buy each one a small piece of bread let alone where they would get it from . Andrew , while identifying a little boy with five barley loaves and two fish throw his hands up in despair . Philip and Andrew see a problem while Jesus sees a hungry crowd that needs to be fed . <p> Sadly , the Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around us the same way as Philip and Andrew did ; as a problem .

It is a process that emerged when Pope Francis called for the Synod on Synodality in 2021 . <p> The question is , what exactly is " Conversation in the Spirit " ( CS ) and why was it an essential process for the Synod on Synodality and now form the process for our journey to the Malaysian Pastoral Convention 2026 ( MPC2026 ) ? <p> Much of the details are offered on the Synod 's website . Initially named " spiritual conversation " , CS " focuses on the quality of one 's capacity to listen as well as the quality of the words spoken . This means paying attention to the spiritual movements in oneself and in the other person during the conversation , which requires being attentive to more than simply the words expressed " . <p> What is presumed in this process is that one has consciously responded to God 's love in faith and formed a relationship with God through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of inner awareness and discernment accompanies their spiritual life that is dependent on what the Holy Spirit might be showing , leading , or teaching them . <p> In CS , they come as they are and now discern together within a specific community 's need or pastoral concern . They now will give the same attentiveness by their attention , respect , and openness to others . It is an approach that takes seriously what happens in the hearts of those conversing . In this process , the group and community try to discern what the Holy Spirit is saying . <p> " Active Listening " and " Speaking from the heart " or " Intentional Speaking ' are the key to the CS discernment process . It is how one disposes oneself to be sensitive to the movement of the Holy Spirit . <p> By active listening , one seeks to understand others deeply by paying attention to both their words and underlying meanings . It requires an open and receptive heart , focusing on the speaker rather than planning a response . It is to listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own life . The person listening tries to see the goodness in the person sharing and what was shared . It is to have faith that the Holy Spirit is acting and can speak through others just as the Spirit speaks to them . One sees the other as a gift without prejudice . Active listening involves humility , openness , patience , and involvement , allowing us to be influenced and learn from others , taking them seriously . <p> Speaking from the heart involves sincerely expressing one 's experiences , thoughts , and feelings and taking responsibility for them without blaming others . This is an important process because sometimes the " blame-game " may be unconsciously present in a discernment process . Here , one shares the truth as they know and experience it without imposing it on others , offering a generous gift in return for active listening . <p> Interestingly , the Synod website writes , " This process is greatly enriched by a regular personal practice of prayerful selfexamen . Without a habit of discernment and knowledge of oneself and how God is present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or speak from the heart . " <p> It is within these contexts that the Animating core team , Msgr Jude Miranda , Fr Simon Labrooy , and Fr Lawrence Ng , speaks of " counsel " as emerging from this process that can be applied pastorally at a diocese , parish , and ministries . They can be seen as promptings of the Holy Spirit that can help the Church move pastorally forward and contribute to a wider conversation during the MPC2026.

It is God 's love for us that He not only gives us His Word but also lends us His ear . <p> 2 .

This is the beginning of the death of the spiritual life , and in the end there is nothing left but spiritual chatter and clerical condescension arrayed in pious words . One who can not listen long and patiently will presently be talking beside the point and be never really speaking to others , albeit he be not conscious of it .

When we move beyond mere self-serving words and turn to our brothers and sisters with that tenderness which warms the heart , we have indeed been touched by the Holy Spirit .

This is probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having been interviewed by her earlier this year . Not only that , but the 21-year-old is also known for her electric performances and incredible choreography so she definitely got the moves to recreate some of the legend 's most iconic music videos and stage moments . <h> 2 . Sabrina Carpenter <p> Source : IG/sabrinacarpenter <p> Both Sabrina and Britney have a background in Disney so that 's already one thing the " Espresso " singer can relate to the icon . Apart from singing , Sabrina is still a full-time actress , having been in multiple projects such as " Tall Girl " , " Emergency " and " Work It " so she 'll have no problems going through auditions to at least be short-listed to play one of the best entertainers of all time . <h> 3 . Sydney Sweeney <p> Source : IG/sydneysweeney <p> Unlike the other celebs mentioned on this list , Sydney is one of the few who does n't have a background in singing or dancing so it 's hard to imagine her busting some of Britney 's iconic dance moves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chops to pull the character off , especially for the story 's more dramatic scenes . Will she consider auditioning ? <h> 4 . Olivia Holt <p> Source : IG/oliviaholt <p> Another Disney alumnus , this is more of our personal suggestion than fans ' . While we 're not too sure about her dancing , Olivia Holt certainly can sing and is known for her many dance tracks . Her role in the 2021 series " Cruel Summer " proves that she definitely has what it takes to play not only the Southern star on her joyful days but on her more challenging days as well . <h> 5 . Florence Pugh <p> Source : IG/florencepugh <p> The UK actress has done comedy , horror , superhero and drama but one thing she has n't done is playing a real-life person in a biopic , which makes her one of the most perfect candidates to take on the challenge to play Britney Spears . If you 're wondering about her vocals , Florence Pugh actually proved to everyone she has the singing abilities from the 2023 movie " Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Source : IG/milliebobbybrown <p> Millie Bobby once expressed her interest in playing Britney Spears in a biopic . In an interview on the " Drew Barrymore Show " in 2022 , the actress said , " I want to play a real person and I think for me , Britney . I think her story , first of all , resonates with me . I see the scramble for words in her interviews and I do n't know her , but when I look at pictures of her , I feel like I could tell her story in the right way and hers only . " <p> Now that the biopic is confirmed , this is her chance to prove that she can portray the singer and do her story justice . What do you think ? <h> 7 . Elle Fanning <p> Source : IG/ellefanning <p> Elle really said " Hear me out " when she posted her Halloween costume dressing up as Britney Spears . She donned a similar outfit to the star 's iconic MTV VMA performance of " I 'm A Slave 4 U " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not only can the " Maleficent " star act but she can also sing as she showed off her vocals in the 2010 movie " The Runaways " <h> 8 . Emily Kelavos <p> Source : IG/emilykelavos <p> Another one of our suggestions and one of the lesser-known celebs on this list but it could actually work . Perhaps what the Britney Spears biopic needs is an up-and-coming star to play her which could also simultaneously kickstart their career for the rest of their lives . Emily Kelavos grew up as a competitive dancer and is a Southern girl herself like the icon as she was born and raised in Texas . <p> Not only that , but the singer was also part of HYBE 's " Dream Academy " and almost debuted in KATSEYE ( ? ? ? ? ) . She was unfortunately eliminated in the final selection , but maybe auditioning to play Britney could put her on the world stage that she dreamed of . <p> In the end , since Britney herself is involved with the project , she 'll have the final say on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of these actresses do you think can play Britney Spears should they choose to audition ? <p> Malaysia 's live-wire for the latest news , trends , and entertainment is finally here .

Along with it are a host of new additions , including updates for the Safari web browser , an array of Apple Intelligence features , and more . <p> Particularly interesting from the lot is a new Continuity feature that lets you mirror your iPhone on your Mac device 's screen . It does exactly what it says on the tin , which is giving you the ability to control your Apple smartphone remotely from a Mac , MacBook or iMac -- save for some limitations , of course . Having access to the macOS Sequoia beta , I figured I 'd give this a go . <h> First Things First <p> But before I move on , I should mention the minimum requirements for the new iPhone Mirroring feature .

But once you 've gotten that sorted , connecting the two will be automatic and almost instantaneous the next time around . <p> The speediness also applies to the framerate , as well as the latency between your iPhone and Mac . I 've barely noticed any lag when navigating through the former 's interface , launching apps , and so on . In case you 're wondering , you can launch games that are installed on your phone , but keep in mind that controls are still limited to the touchscreen . <p> Speaking of which , you can interact with the app via mouse and keyboard , as well as the trackpad if you 're on a MacBook . Commands such as long presses still apply , whereas certain things are assigned to the mouse wheel or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typing when using word processing or messaging apps . Meanwhile , tapping the white bar at the bottom of the screen will minimise apps and bring you back to the home screen . <h> The Bad <p> Unfortunately , there 's no way for you to resize the iPhone Mirroring 's window at macOS Sequoia 's current build . The screen apparently reflects the same size and aspect ratio of your phone in real life , which can be underwhelming for those hoping to view it in a larger size . On that note , certain text will also appear tiny and harder to read , unless you 've increased the font size on your iPhone . <p> There 's no indication whether Apple will update the app to allow for screen resizing in a future version of macOS Sequoia . That said , the company has been considerate about accessibility , so there 's a chance that this could potentially happen . <h> Other Stuff To Keep In Mind <p> It 's worth noting that you do n't need to unlock your phone when operating it through iPhone Mirroring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will sever the connection . Which makes sense , as you do n't want someone who somehow has access to your Mac to mess around with your phone when you 're away with it . <p> Another thing that you ca n't access while in this mode is the iPhone 's cameras . This is mostly due to privacy concerns , but if you 're thinking of using your phone as a webcam , there 's actually different approaches for that . <p> In fact , the methods in question are actually part of existing Continuity features that lets you select your iPhone 's cameras when running FaceTime or Photo Booth on your Mac . Oh , and do note that you ca n't use iPhone Mirroring when using the two aforementioned apps . <p> Next up are notifications . After successfully synchronising your iPhone , your Mac will provide you with pop-up notifications of messages , transactions , reminders and so on , which will appear on the upper right corner of your screen . You do n't need iPhone Mirroring to be active for this , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mac 's Settings app . <h> So What 's Great About iPhone Mirroring ? <p> Whether the app is actually useful depends on who you ask . Some will see it as a great way to focus on just one device , while others will find it beneficial in terms of privacy . Concerning the latter , you can restrict your chats , messages and emails to the iPhone Mirroring app 's smaller screen , therefore making it harder for nosey friends/colleagues/etc to see your conversations . <p> It 's also an excellent way to keep your phone on the side , therefore allowing you to make or answer calls and even reply to messages directly from your Mac . Another neat thing is that iPhone Mirroring lets you use your phone while it is in StandBy Mode . <h> When Can I Use It ? <p> Image : Apple <p> Later this year when macOS Sequoia is released to the public , according to Apple . While no exact date is mentioned , unofficial sources such as MacRumors are claiming that the update might arrive by mid-September 2024 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be seen . <p> Alternatively , you can actually try this out now by enrolling in Apple 's Beta Software Program . Doing so will allow you to download the current beta builds for the company 's various operating platforms , including iOS and macOS . <p> However , it is recommended that you backup your current systems so that you can revert back in case you encounter bugs or other potential issues .

The movie was called ' The Joy Luck Club ' and 31 years later , in my opinion , it is still the best movie of what epitomises the ultimate Asian story . <p> Film critic Roger Ebert gave one of the best reviews of ' The Joy Luck Club ' : " These stories are about Chinese and Chinese-American characters , but they are universal stories . Anyone with parents or children , which is to say , everyone , will identify with the way that the hopes of one generation can become both the restraints and the inspirations of the next . <p> " The Joy Luck Club is like a flowering of talent that has been waiting so long to be celebrated . It is also one of the most touching and moving of the year 's films .

Chu ( Chinese ) ; <p> 2005 -- Memoirs of a Geisha , directed by Rob Marshall ( American ) ; <p> 2003 -- Old Boy , directed by Park Chan Wook ( Korean ) ; <p> 2000 -- Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon , directed by Ang Lee ( Chinese ) ; <p> 2000 -- In the Mood for Love , directed by Wong Kar Wai ( Chinese ) ; <p> 1993 -- The Joy Luck Club directed by Wayne Wang ( Chinese ) ; <p> 1986 -- A Better Tomorrow , directed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enter the Dragon , directed by Robert Clouse ( American ) , and ; <p> 1954 -- Godzilla ( Gojira ) , directed by Ishiro Honda ( Japanese ) . <p> The Asian representation in Hollywood has increased significantly over the last 15 years . <p> A new study by the University of Southern California has shown that from 2007 to 2022 , the percentage of Asian characters with speaking roles took a leap from around three per cent to nearly 16 per cent within that period . <p> However , the vast majority of these were still in supporting roles . <p> The overall the prospects are still dim . Sociologist Nancy Wang Yuen told NBC News in 2021 : " Hollywood is something that repeats what has worked before . The early representation of Asians were just East Asians , and the stereotypes were the accent , the exotic , the villain . <p> " All those tropes have not changed for 100 years .

But then when regulators do happen to inspect in the meantime , such arguments do not hold sway . <p> This corruption and inefficiency has already led so many noble , dedicated people to give up trying to do good things for the disadvantaged in our society . <p> Unfortunately , these same weaknesses can be exploited by others who are not as ethical ; in the worst case scenario , by people who intentionally want to commit evil behind the facade of a noble cause . <p> But this corruption and inefficiency is compounded often by institutional failures in tackling such cases .

No , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are afraid because ... they will not give us a warning that " we 're going to fire ( on ) this village now or that village . " So , we are afraid , but none of us has been hurt or wounded . <p> For us , this is a d ? j ? vu scenario , because we passed through this scenario in 2006 ( during the 34-day Lebanon war between Israel and Hezbollah ) , and it was disastrous . <p> Now , it 's even worse , because they are not only attacking the areas where Hezbollah is active . They are also attacking where they suspect even one Hezbollah ( member ) is hiding or is going to visit . Even if the whole village is a Christian village , and you have one house that is hosting one member of Hezbollah , this could be a reason to bomb the village . <p> Before , if you were not in the south of the country , you were safe .

We still have 3,000 to 4,000 Christian families living just on the border with Israel in the middle of the war , and they refuse to leave because they do n't have Hezbollah people inside the village .

Now , to this , we have to add the 250,000 who were forced to leave . It 's important to know that they left not because they were afraid , but because they were warned by the Israeli army through messages on their phones that they would have to leave their houses in two hours , otherwise they will die there .

The road was packed with cars , and people -- including children -- had no food , no water in their cars for 14 to 18 hours . Some people came on their own and provided sandwiches and water for the children . This was an unprecedented way to leave . <p> How do we help them ? Through the heroic work of the church . <p> We send the food parcels to the closest safe village in an area . And then the priest will coordinate with one truck to go and get the number of parcels he needs to distribute . He will see when it is a good time to distribute -- when there is less shelling .

We do n't rely on the government 's services because it 's not viable . Even when there is no war , we always rely on a parallel system . <p> How are those you serve -- and you and your team -- holding up spiritually ? This is different according to your political affiliation . We have two different points of view in Lebanon . <p> The people who are with Hezbollah say , " Well , this is our duty . ...

So why should we jeopardize our communities , our villages ? " <p> The country is very fragile , very weak economically . And they know that we can not stand against the army of Israel , which is very big and very powerful and can destroy us completely . We can make them uncomfortable , but we can not beat them .

At first glance , it looks like a shrunken Countryman , with a front end that features a closed-off , octagonal-shaped grille and a small lower intake . The headlamps are unique to the Aceman and have a distinctive daytime running light signature , which can be switched to three different modes to be expressive . <p> Along the sides , you 'll find retractable door handles and prominent body cladding , the latter underscoring the crossover aesthetic , as do the standard roof rails and rear skid plate .

The star of the show is the large , circular touchscreen that sits just above a row of physical controls for important things ( parking brake , gear selector , start/stop " key " , experience modes , media volume ) .

And with the revival of relations with other religious traditions , the Church strives " together with them to build a better world " ( 41 ) . <p> The conversion of relationshipsThe second part of the Document ( 49-77 ) opens with the recognition of " the call for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lord , between men and women , in the family , in the local community , among social groups and religions , with the earth itself " ( 50 ) . <p> At the same time the Synod recognizes that some " continued to experience the pain of feeling excluded or judged because of their marital situation , identity , or sexuality " ( ibid . ) . <p> " To be a synodal Church , we are required to open ourselves to a genuine relational conversion that redirects each person 's priorities and we must once again learn from the Gospel that attending to relationships is not merely a strategy or a tool for greater organisational effectiveness . Relationships and bonds are the means by which God the Father has revealed Himself in Jesus and the Spirit " ( ibid . ) . <p> They final document goes on to acknowledge " the widely expressed pain and suffering on the part of many women from every region and continent , both lay and consecrated , during the synodal process " , which " reveal how often we fail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In particular , " the call to renewed relationships in the Lord Jesus flourishes in the different contexts in which His disciples live " , joined to " the plurality of cultures " ; yet " interaction by people from diverse cultural contexts can also lead to distorted relationships that are not in keeping with the Gospel " ( 53 ) . <p> " The evils that plague our world ... are rooted in these dynamics " , the Document affirms , noting that " the most radical and dramatic rejection is that of human life itself ; this leads to the rejection of the unborn , as well as of the elderly " ( 54 ) . <p> Ministries for Mission " Charisms , Vocations , and Ministries for Mission " ( 57-67 ) lie at the heart of the document , which focuses especially on a greater participation of lay men and women . The ordained ministry is " at the service of harmony " ( 68 ) ; and the ministry of the bishop aims at " discerning and bringing together in unity " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Within the discussion of the episcopal ministry , the Document notes that " in the case of titular bishops today , the constitutive relationship between the bishop and the local Church does not appear with sufficient clarity , for example , in the case of papal representatives and those who serve in the Roman Curia " ( 70 ) . <p> Priests and deacons serve with the bishops for a " collaboration between ordained ministers within a synodal Church " ( 74 ) . So , the experience of " Synodal Spirituality " is significant , for if " spiritual depth at both personal and communitarian levels is lacking , synodality is reduced to organisational expediency " ( 44 ) . <p> For this reason , the Document notes , " practised with humility , the synodal style enables the Church to be a prophetic voice in today 's world . " <p> The conversion of processesIn the third part of the Document ( 79-108 ) , the Synod notes that " in prayer and dialogue , we have recognised that ecclesial discernment , the care for decision-making processes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are practices through which we respond to the Word that shows us the paths of mission " ( 79 ) . <p> In particular , it notes , " These three practices are closely intertwined . Decision-making processes need ecclesial discernment , which requires listening in a climate of trust that is supported by transparency and accountability . Trust must be mutual : decision-makers need to be able to trust and listen to the People of God . The latter , in turn , needs to be able to trust those in authority " ( 80 ) . <p> In fact , " Ecclesial Discernment for Mission " " is not an organisational technique but rather a spiritual practice grounded in a living faith " and " is never just a setting out of one 's own personal or group point of view or a summing up of differing individual opinions " ( 82 ) . <p> " The Structure of the Decision-making Process " ( 87-94 ) , " Transparency , Accountability , and Evaluation " ( 95-102 ) , and " Synodality and Participatory Bodies " ( 103-108 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Document , arising from the experience of the Synod . <p> The Conversion of BondsThe essence of the fourth part of the Final Document ( 109-139 ) is expressed in its first paragraph : " In a time when there is great change occurring in the places where the Church is rooted and on pilgrimage , we need to cultivate new forms of the exchange of gifts and the network of bonds that unite us . In this we are sustained by the ministry of the bishops in communion amongst themselves and with the Bishop of Rome " ( 109 ) . <p> The expression " Firmly Rooted yet Pilgrims " ( 110-119 ) recalls that " The Church can not be understood apart from its roots in a specific territory , in that space and time where a shared experience of encounter with the saving God occurs " ( 110 ) . <p> This part of the Document also gives due consideration to the phenomena of " population mobility " ( 112 ) and " the spread of digital culture " ( 113 ) . <p> In this perspective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with our diverse charisms and ministries , while at the same time engaging in the exchange of gifts among the Churches , is an effective sign of the love and mercy of God in Christ " ( 120 ) . <p> " The guiding principle of the relationship among churches is the perspective of communion through the sharing of gifts " ( 124 ) . From this starting point , the Document elaborates " The Bonds of Unity : Episcopal Conferences and Ecclesial Assemblies " ( 124-129 ) . <p> The synodal reflection on " The Service of the Bishop of Rome " ( 130-139 ) is particularly significant . With reference precisely to the promotion of greater collaboration and listening , the Synod exhorts Dicasteries " to initiate a consultation with Episcopal Conferences and with the corresponding structures of the Eastern Churches sui iuris " before publishing " important normative documents " ( 135 ) . <p> Forming a People for Missionary Discipleship " The Holy People of God require proper formation so that they can witness to the joy of the Gospel and grow in the practice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sons and daughters of God in following Jesus Christ , contemplated in prayer and recognised in those who are poor " ( 141 ) , the Document affirms at the beginning of the fifth part ( 140-151 ) . <p> " One of the requests that emerged most strongly and from all contexts during the synodal process is that the formation provided by the Christian community be integral and continuing " ( 143 ) . In this regard , too , we see the urgent need for " an exchange of gifts between different vocations ( communion ) , in the perspective of a service to be performed ( mission ) and in a style of involvement and education in differentiated co-responsibility ( participation ) " ( 147 ) . <p> " Another area of great importance is the promotion in all ecclesial contexts of a culture of safeguarding , making communities ever safer places for minors and vulnerable persons " ( 150 ) . <p> Finally , " The themes of the Church 's social doctrine , such as commitment to peace and justice , care for our common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more widely shared among the People of God " ( 151 ) . <p> Entrustment to Mary " Living through the synodal process again , we have become aware that the salvation to be received and proclaimed is inherently relational " , the Document says in its penultimate paragraph . " We live it and witness to it together . History reveals itself to us tragically marked by war , rivalry for power , and thousands of injustices and abuses . We know , however , that the Spirit has placed the desire for authentic relationships and true bonds in the heart of every human being . Creation itself speaks of unity and sharing , of diversity and of variously interconnected forms of life " ( 154 ) . <p> The text concludes with a prayer entrusting " the results of this Synod to the Virgin Mary " . " May she ... teach us to be a people of disciples and missionaries together , to be a synodal Church " ( 155 ) . --Vatican News

<p> Three years ago , a lawyer who made derogatory remarks comparing the annual Harvest Festival Unduk Ngadau beauty pageant to a cattle show was fined seven buffaloes by the native court after a

offences of various natures , ranging from the minor ( plucking fruit from someone else 's orchard ) to the major ( deciding on family inheritance ) . <p> Advertisement <p> The system revolves around the native adat or customary laws of living within a community and respecting the social fabric and natural ecosystem that is both sentient and spiritual . <p> If a native individual feels that he has

consisting of the district chief and two other members who are native chiefs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out punishments dependent on the severity of the offence amongst other factors . <p> " Traditionally , members of the native court were the elders of the native community , highly knowledgeable in native customs , trustworthy , respected and have a good standing in the community , " said Sabah Law Society 's native customary laws , customs and culture sub-committee chairman Datuk John Sikayun . <p> The native courts conventionally only has jurisdiction over the natives of Sabah , although non-natives can be summoned with the approval of the District Officer . <p> Native courts also can not make judgment over offences that are concurrently provided under the Penal Code . <p> Native customary law encompasses various matters such as marriage , betrothal , breach of promise , divorce , adoption , guardianship , harassment , disputes , and defamation but is not confined to just the written law and can vary from village to village based on their own customs . <p> " For instances , some communities may have penalties when a younger sibling marries before an elder sibling ( langkah ) , or when a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) is over " , said Sikayun who is also former Sabah Law Association president . <p> Restorative and community-minded justice <p> Sabah Law Society 's young advocates sub-committee Isaiah Majinbon explained that natives believe the ideal relationship between humans and the spiritual realm is one of harmony , referred to as osogit ( cool ) or balanced . <p> " However , human misdeeds such as intentionally harming the environment , damaging others ' property , threatening others , or committing serious offences like adultery or incest -- including marriages between close blood relatives -- disrupts this balance , creating imbalance or ahasu , " said Majinbon . <p> Natives believe ahasu is a bad omen to the community and can bring droughts , floods , epidemics and other catastrophes which is when appropriate rituals of blood sacrifices of animals are used to " cool " the " heat " of the imbalance . <p> Sometimes , compensation called sogit is paid

the offence , the sogit may be offered and shared among the community during a communal gathering ( karamaian ) to foster reconciliation within the village or otherwise given directly to the aggrieved

parties reach an outcome that respects communal values and acknowledges cultural practices . <p> " For instance , growing up , the custom of showing respect to my elders was a significant part of native culture so when a younger person seeks forgiveness from an elder , they may offer peace by placing a small amount of salt on the elder 's tongue as sogit . <p> " This gesture holds a deeply

This is what makes the Native Court of Sabah unique to us , " said Sikayun and Majinbon . <p> The native court emphasises reconciliation and mediation over punishment , utilising culturally relevant , practical and flexible forms of justice to keep communities peaceful and close knit . <p> Need for reform <p> Acknowledging its significance to the native communities of Sabah , the current government has set up a reform committee which both Sikayun and Majinbon are members of , to look into the reform of the native court to be on par with the civil and Shariah courts . <p> The committee has proposed institutional amendments affecting the court 's organisational structure , procedures , as well as its jurisdiction and powers . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a native , and include Muslim natives and also get rid of primitive punishments and beliefs like banishments and trial by drowning . <p> It will also raise the minimum age of consent for marriage for girls , which is currently considered acceptable as soon as they have their first period . <p> The proposals also address the appointment of the native chiefs and judges to require adept knowledge of customs in order to not make arbitrary decisions and judgments that may not serve the original spirit of native courts . <p> " We would like to ensure that judges and those in decisive positions have attained a degree of competency , understanding and significance of native laws and should be free of political influence . <p> " Now , it is up to policymakers to bring these reforms to life and ensure they are effectively implemented , " said Sikayun . <p> " At the core of these reforms lies a need to preserve our restorative approach to justice , which has long defined us .
