Do we think it 's her fault for sticking her head above the parapet , or maybe just bad luck ? <p> It is n't bad luck , and sticking her head up is part of her job . We expect our politicians to tell us what they think . <p> I get some horrible abuse thrown my way from time to time , but it 's nothing compared to what women MPs have to put up with . Especially , it seems , if they are brown . Women journalists get it too , most commonly if they dare to write about sexual abuse . <p> Is this because , as men know well , testicles are a good place to store your mental capacities ? <p> Some social media warriors seem to believe brown women are particularly " weak " in this regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they say , and definitely not evidence that the pressure they are required to live with is unbearable . <p> Another reason women do n't complain about abuse so much : they may doubt anything will be done about it . <p> And beyond all that , to complain is to let the abusers think they 've won . Because if the abuse drives women out of politics , or if the trauma becomes too much and they behave badly , well , the bastards are right : they have won . <p> All this has a social context . Most of the time , men take it for granted our personal freedom is not under threat . We sail through our days , not even thinking about it . For many women , the awareness of physical and emotional risks may rarely go away . <p> When people speak about a culture war , this is one of the deepest and most horrifying parts of it . Women are hated . Not by all men , obviously . Not by most men . Of course not . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : insidious , forceful , dangerous . And tolerated . <p> The hatred is n't casual or lacking purpose . It 's intended to undermine women who stray into the world of men . It feeds on the way we condition ourselves : women , to be silent ; men , to believe it ca n't really be happening , or is n't that serious , because it is n't happening to us . <p> Barbie , the movie , puts it much better than I can . <p> Ryan Gosling as Ken in Barbie . Photo / Warner Bros <p> By the way , women on the left in politics are not the only targets . Judith Collins and others have spoken about the gendered vileness they have to put up with too , especially from some people who think of themselves as progressive . <p> Actually , it 's not even as simple as men = good , women = bad .

That 's as true for her as it is for everyone . <p> But as Shaun Robinson from the Mental Health Foundation has pointed out , empathy and accountability are not opposites . In fact , they work pretty well together . <p> Our justice system is underpinned by the idea . The court of public opinion , not quite so much . <p> For some people , asking for empathy with accountability undermines the primal desire to punish . It confuses the narrative that the way to deal with crime is to lock up the bad guys and throw away the key . <p> You 'd think everyone would want a world with less fear of physical and mental abuse .

In an email last year he told one man who was harassing the council " almost daily " to " go f**k yourself " . <p> On this occasion , the man had been demanding to know where council officials lived . A very nasty threat lurks in that demand . <p> Salt said he understood the man was a self-declared " sovereign citizen " , or " SovCit " .

" There is a realistic possibility , " they said , " that someone inspired by SovCit rhetoric will commit a spontaneous act of extremist violence in New Zealand . " <p> When politicians receive threats of violence , they do n't know if they 're from people having a laugh , or people planning to kill them , or people who might get " spontaneously " violent . Shaw , remember , was bashed at a bus stop in 2019 . <p> But whether those threats are sinister or stupid , the cumulative effect is to normalise fear . <p> We do n't all share the responsibility for this .

Many of the people who make violent jokes about women do too . <p> When we let it pass , we let them believe they are right . <p> None of this means we should n't have political debates or that those debates should n't include criticism of politicians .

But his initial business plan changed after reading about endangered kiwi and the threat from predators . <p> Businessman Gary Lane created a 5km-long predator-proof fence around the Wairakei Golf Course . <p> He bought his partners out in 2008 and set about creating a wildlife sanctuary , spending millions on a 5km-long , 2m-high predator fence around the 150ha property , with a hood to stop rats , stoats and possums from climbing over the top . The pests inside were eradicated and 30,000 trees were planted . Now the Wairakei Golf Course &amp; Sanctuary echoes to loud birdsong , tame fallow deer graze and pheasants roam the property . Wairakei also hosts a kiwi hatchery run by Save the Kiwi , producing about 100 eggs a year .

About two-thirds of those who play at Wairakei each year are visitors , not members . <p> Lane is proud of what has been achieved but thinks the expense of predator-proofing large areas of land puts others off . When Cyclone Gabrielle roared through the region in February last year , huge trees crashed down and destroyed sections of the fence . Although the broken parts were fixed within 48 hours , predators got in which meant trapping had to start again . The cyclone destroyed between 1500 and 2000 trees in the sanctuary , a clean-up Lane describes as " expensive " . <p> But the cost is worth it , he says . <p> " You can actually hear and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell their dinner inside and they ca n't get at it .

" <p> Gary Lane has played golf all over the world but says Wairakei Golf &amp; Sanctuary is his favourite . <p> He 's a member of the exclusive Sunningdale Golf &amp; Country Club in London and has played on courses all around the world .

At the end of the day buildings are for people and the better you can create the environment within a building or in local countryside everybody wins out of that .

" When you own a golf course you really are just the custodian and watch out if you think otherwise because there are a lot of people who will offer up comment .

" <p> In addition , he feels strongly that golf courses should be built so that golfers can play them , not just an elite few . <p> " It sounds pretty obvious but the trend in the United States for high-end golf courses is that very few get to play them and I think often that is not the best use of the land .

One of the charms of Millbrook today is that it 's not gated - unless American presidents are staying there . Locals and visitors can walk in the grounds , have a meal or a drink , and they can play a casual round of golf without being a member . <p> The idea was a " turn-key " development , with Eiichi Ishii as a founding investor , that would include an 18-hole golf course , club house , restaurants and accommodation . The grounds , with its approach avenue flanked by towering trees planted in 1867 , and charming old mill buildings , were already picturesque . <p> The Ishii family took over ownership of Millbrook in the 1990s , famously hosting US President Bill Clinton in 1999 , and continued to develop privately-owned homes and build a second 18-hole golf course .

His first taste of the golf resort world was in the early 1980s , earning his golfing apprenticeship working with Arnold Palmer on an ambitious project at Walter Peak Station , on the shores of Lake Wakatipu . Billed as a world-class luxury resort , it was to have an 18-hole golf course , a hotel , a village , and 1000 apartments and chalets . <p> Accessible only by boat -- the TSS Earnslaw and other tourist vessels still visit daily - the project never got off the ground . <p> Golf courses are n't easy to manage , Darby says . Without support , ongoing investment and water , they will founder .

Future plans include reducing the 18-hole course to a nine-hole and building 3000 apartments and terraced houses on the 255ha site . <h> New golf courses in the planning <p> But for every failed or struggling course , a new one is being built as New Zealand increasingly becomes a golfing mecca for visitors in an industry now worth more than $400 million annually . <p> Here are some in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developing a new 18-hole championship golf course at Glendhu Bay overlooking Lake Wanaka , due to open in 2025 .

@@105368232 <p> The New Year always brings the promise of a new beginning . But it also confronts us with last year 's headaches . The problems we may have been only too happy to consign to the backof our minds as we enjoyed a summer break with family and friends . <p> For the National-led Government , the list of challenges inherited in 2023 is long . But few ministers will return to the Beehive with as daunting a task as Finance Minister Nicola Willis . <p> Core government spending in the current year is projected to be 74 per cent higher than when Labour took office in 2017 ( $140 billion , compared with $81b in 2017/2018 ) . Adjusting for inflation brings the real percentage increase back to 39 per cent . But even still , most voters would be unable to identify improvements in core public service outcomes - think health , education , or criminal justice -- that might justify this increase . <p> The task for the new Finance Minister is to reintroduce fiscal discipline to public sector spending , and the public service itself should be a primary target . <p> But first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finance Minister 's challenge . <p> Treasury 's Half Year Economic Fiscal Update ( HYEFU ) , released just before Christmas , forecasted an overall government fiscal deficit for the five years to June 2028 of $15b . <p> In contrast , the incoming Labour-led Government in late 2017 was greeted with a Treasury forecast with cumulative fiscal surpluses in the five years to June 2022 of $26 billion . <p> Of course , a little over two years later , Covid intervened , and pandemic-related spending consigned Treasury 's 2020 fiscal forecast to the dustbin . But Covid is not to blame for the daunting deficits the Treasury now projects . <p> Where other OECD countries managed to reign in post-pandemic government spending , New Zealand under former Finance Minister Grant Robertson showed no such restraint . So much so that in the International Monetary Fund 's October 2023 Fiscal Monitor , New Zealand 's forecast primary government deficit featured as the third worst among advanced economies . <p> Willis 's mini-budget , delivered in tandem with Treasury 's HYEFU on December 20 , identified savings of $7.5b over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National 's tax cuts promises , much more radical solutions will be required to restore stability to the Government 's finances . This column has previously identified two areas where big savings can be made : Where to wield the knife for spending cuts . <p> With New Zealand First as a member of the coalition Government , the first of them - retirement spending - is likely to be politically impossible . <p> But there should be no such political prohibition on achieving savings in the second area : the size of the public service itself . <p> When the Ardern Government came to office in 2017 , the core public service comprised 47,252 full-time equivalent officials . Roll forward to 2023 , that total had increased to a massive 63,117 FTEs , an increase of 15,865 or 34 per cent . <p> At the average level of public service income reported by the Public Service Commissioner of $97,200 , this increased headcount translates to an increased public sector payroll cost of over $1.5b a year . <p> The increase in headcount and payroll cost might receive some level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical front-line staff like teachers , nurses or police . But none of these key public sector occupations are included in the numbers . <p> Rather , the 63,000 FTEs largely represent the public sector 's bureaucracy or administration . It is here where the big increases in headcount have occurred . <p> For example , the number of public service " managers " has increased from 5333 in 2017 , to 8059 in 2023 ( up 51 per cent ) ; " policy analysts " from 2633 to 3949 ( up 50 per cent ) ; and ' information professionals ' from 5437 to 9426 ( up 73 per cent ) . <p> Of course , many officials do have public-facing roles . These include " inspectors and regulatory officers " and " social , health and education workers " . But , while these are two of the largest occupations within the public service , they have decreased as a proportion of the overall public service headcount . The big increases have been in management and administrative roles . <p> Drilling down to individual departments is also telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MBIE ) as an example . From 3366 FTEs in 2017 , it grew to 5832 in 2022 and to 6282 in June 2023 -- an increase over six years of 87 per cent . Over that time , its management grew by 41 per cent . It now also employs more than twice the number of clerical and administrative workers . <p> It is the same story across practically every other government department . Employment at the Ministry of Transport is up 100 per cent , at the Ministry of Education up 64 per cent ( from 2632 in 2017 to a whopping 4311 ) and at the Ministry for the Environment up 189 per cent . <p> When announcing her mini-budget , Willis rightly identified an " urgent need " for cultural change in the public sector to cut spending . <p> She reiterated National 's pre-election promise to get government departments to cut spending by 6.5 per cent . And she went further by saying she had asked government agencies whose staff had grown by more than 50 per cent since 2017 to cut spending by 7.5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Population growth since 2017 might justify some increase in the size of some parts of the core public service . But if the Finance Minister really wants to bring about a culture change within the public service , her starting point should be to return public sector headcount to 2017 levels . <p> As well as saving the taxpayer $1.5b a year in payroll costs , that would send a clear message to the public service about the need for public sector efficiency , productivity and fiscal restraint . <p> Yet , even at 2017 levels the size of the core public service may be too large . <p> In the first year of former Labour Prime Minister Helen Clark 's tenure as Prime Minister , public sector FTEs stood at just 29,070 , less than half its current level . Since then , New Zealand 's population has grown 37 per cent from 3.8 million to 5.2 million people . Applying that escalator to the public service would result in total FTEs of only slightly under 40,000 -- more than 15 per cent less than the 47,252 level in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over two decades ago . Indeed , on some measures -- most notably educational outcomes as measured by the international league tables -- New Zealand in the year 2000 outperformed New Zealand today . One wonders how the 599 officials in the Ministry of Education at that time managed to outperform the ministry 's 4311 staff today . <p> For a Finance Minister committed to fiscal reform , there is little need to look beyond the Wellington bureaucracy to work out where to start .

@@106516237 <h> Trump and Biden 's foreign leader choices this week reveal how they would govern <p> Eric Garcia <p> 8 March 2024 at 2:45 pm*4-min read <p> BUDAPEST , HUNGARY - FEBRUARY 23 : Hungary 's Prime Minister Viktor Orban ( R ) and Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson ( L ) hold a press conference following their meeting in February 23 , 2024 in Budapest , Hungary . The meeting comes as Hungary 's ruling party has indicated it 's prepared to ratify Sweden 's accession to NATO . After Turkey dropped its objection , Hungary remained the only NATO member to oppose Sweden 's bid , which was launched in the wake of Russia 's large-scale invasion of Ukraine . ( Photo by Janos Kummer/Getty Images ) ( Getty Images ) <p> It 's basically an aphorism at this point that American voters almost never make a decision about their choice for president based on foreign policy . The only exception comes when Americans are in harm 's way , as Lyndon Johnson , Jimmy Carter , Ronald Reagan , George W Bush and Barack Obama can all attest . <p> At the same time , presidential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value at home . Harry Truman 's desegregation of the US military reflected Democrats ' larger shift away from being the party of Southern racists to becoming the party of civil rights . Reagan 's ardent opposition to communism abroad reflected his desire to slash government spending at home . <p> That makes President Joe Biden and former president Donald Trump 's choices of foreign heads of state to meet this week particularly interesting . They reflect much about what values they want to promote at home . <p> During his State of the Union Address to Congress on Thursday , Biden invited Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson , in order to celebrate the Scandinavian nation 's acceptance into NATO . Biden 's decision to welcome the head of state for a country that has historically remained neutral in numerous world conflicts reflected his efforts to actively promote democracy at home and abroad . <p> Indeed , during his address , Biden tied the efforts to defend democracy abroad with his efforts to defeat the authoritarian creep of Trumpism at home . He pointedly mentioned how Trump had killed legislation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " predecessor " had incited a riot to overturn the 2020 election results . <p> " History is watching -- just like history watched three years ago on January 6 when insurrectionists stormed this very Capitol and placed a dagger to the throat of American democracy , " Biden said . <p> Biden has good reason to tie the two together , given Trump 's fond words for Putin and the fact that Russia intervened in 2016 to help Trump become president . Most notably , in a 2018 press conference with Putin in Helsinki , Trump said , " President Putin says it 's not Russia . I do n't see any reason why it would be . " <p> Conversely , Trump 's decisions about which foreign leaders visit him indicate what kind of president he will be . In recent months , he has gone from spewing anti-immigrant rhetoric to spouting outright white nationalist talking points about migrants bringing disease and " poisoning the blood " of the United States . He has also promised to carry out the " largest deportation in the history of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican voters . <p> Trump has routinely praised the Hungarian far-right leader and Orb ? n has become a darling of many in the conservative movement for his hard-right policies on everything from immigration to his opposition to LGBTQ+ rights . The Conservative Political Action Conference even recently hosted an event in Hungary . Orb ? n has also said about Hungary that " We do not want to become a mixed race . " <p> Not surprisingly , Orb ? n also has severely curtailed democracy , rewriting the nation 's constitution and school textbooks . He has implemented laws that specifically benefit his Fidesz Party . According to Freedom House , a nonprofit that monitors democracies across the globe , Hungary 's status as a democracy has severely diminished since Orb ? n took power . <p> Orb ? n is also a critic of supporting Ukraine . Last year , he told Tucker Carlson , a hero of extreme forces within the GOP , that a Trump presidency would be " the only way out " of Russia 's war with Ukraine and the idea that Kyiv @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This is not unfamiliar rhetoric . Many Republicans -- such as Senator JD Vance of Ohio and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin -- have made similar comments . <p> All of this gives an idea of the type of government Trump would provide were he allowed to return to office . He 's previously said he would only be a dictator on his first day in office and " for the liars and cheaters and fraudsters and censors and imposters who have commandeered our government , it will be their judgment day . " <p> Who Biden and Trump choose to acquaint themselves with offers a glaring relief about what they value . While most voters may not understand the depth of these choices , they reveal as much about their domestic policy proposals as their foreign policy ones .

A Step-by-Step Lesson To Form An LLC In Arizona <p> Starting a business can be a rewarding journey , but it also involves navigating various legal requirements and considerations . For entrepreneurs in Arizona , one popular option for structuring their business is to form a Limited Liability Company ( LLC ) . An LLC provides liability protection for its members while offering flexibility in management and taxation . However , to establish an LLC in Arizona , it 's essential to understand the specific requirements and steps involved in the process . In this comprehensive guide , we 'll explore the LLC requirements in Arizona and provide a step-by-step lesson to help you form your LLC successfully . <h> Understanding the Basics of an LLC <p> Before delving into the specific requirements for forming an LLC in Arizona , it 's crucial to have a basic understanding of what an LLC is and how it operates .

This step can be beneficial if you 're not ready to form your LLC immediately but want to ensure that your chosen name is available when you 're ready to proceed . <p> Step 3 : Prepare and File Articles of Organization <p> The next step is to prepare and file Articles of Organization with the Arizona Corporation Commission .

The statutory agent must have a physical address in Arizona and be available during regular business hours to receive legal notices and official correspondence . <h> Step 5 : Create an Operating Agreement <p> While not required by Arizona law , it 's highly recommended for LLCs to create an operating agreement . This document outlines the ownership and management structure of the LLC , as well as the rights and responsibilities of its members .

Additionally , you may need to obtain any necessary business licenses or permits required for your specific industry or location . <h> Step 7 : Publish a Notice ( Not Required ) <p> Unlike some states , Arizona does not have a publication requirement for LLCs . This means that newly formed LLCs in Arizona are not required to publish a notice of their formation in a local newspaper . <h> Conclusion <p> Forming an LLC in Arizona offers numerous benefits for entrepreneurs , including liability protection , flexibility in management , and favorable tax treatment . By following the step-by-step guide outlined above , you can navigate the process of forming your LLC with confidence and ease . Remember to consult with legal and financial professionals to ensure compliance with all state and federal requirements and to set your business up for success . <p> In conclusion , understanding the LLC requirements in Arizona and following a step-by-step approach to form your LLC will help you establish a strong legal foundation for your business venture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embark on your entrepreneurial journey with confidence and clarity . <h> Did you know Scoop has an Ethical Paywall ? <p> If you 're using Scoop for work , your organisation needs to pay a small license fee with Scoop Pro .

@@107053236 <h> There Are No Bystanders When Evolution Is Demanding A Revolution In Consciousness <p> " The Omega point " is a term used by Pierre Teilhard de Chardin to describe the goal towards which the universe purportedly evolves . He believed cosmic and terrestrial evolution was in a process converging in man toward a final unity . Teleology notwithstanding , where man is concerned , Teilhard got it backasswards . <p> The question to which neither Western nor Eastern philosophy has been able to provide sufficient insight is this : Given that nature unfolds in a dynamic and holistic order , and humans evolved along with all other creatures on earth , how and why did man become such a factor of fragmentation and disorder on this planet ? <p> Nearly all explanations for ' the riddle of man ' suffer from addiction to the idea of progress , including Teilhard de Chardin 's " Omega Point . " Besides supporting an anthropocentric view that retains man at the center of the universe , de Chardin made the mistake of assuming evolution is constantly advancing . <p> In point of fact , man represents a tremendous anomaly . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also for countless other species on this planet , since in the absurdly named ' Anthropocene Age ' Homo sapiens has started " the Sixth Extinction . " ( All five previous mass extinctions of fauna and flora were caused by natural events , like asteroids and massive volcanism . ) <p> Given the capability of a single , supposedly self-aware species to bring about such a planetary event , the evolution of man poses huge , unaddressed questions for philosophers . <p> Advertisement - scroll to continue reading <h> Are you getting our free newsletter ? <p> Of course , if one assumes that the universe is simply a mechanism plus chance , and that consciousness is merely the neural mechanism of thought , then there is no problem , except how to deaden your heart against what we humans are doing to the earth and each other . <p> But when the mind is attentively quiet , the brain has direct contact with actuality , the indivisible and unknowable order , intelligence and sacredness that permeates nature and the universe . <p> Denied by atheists and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also derided by religionists and monotheists on the other . <p> Nevertheless , the nameless is accessible to every human being that ends the observer and time through intense , unguided attention . <p> Passive watchfulness , especially in the mirror of nature , initiates a movement of negation and ushers in a profound stillness of mind . One lets go of the known and enters a state of being rather than becoming . <p> The contradiction of man is that we are a sentient creature generating more and more fragmentation and disorder on a supremely beautiful planet in a cosmos of infinite , dynamic order . De Chardin did not come close to resolving that conundrum . <p> Evolution appears to have an intrinsic drive toward evolving beings of higher consciousness , but it hits a big bump in the road with the evolution of ' higher thought . ' That 's because symbolic thought is both a necessary precondition for complete awareness , and the greatest impediment to it . <p> That is , on one hand the brain on a given planet ( the **27;277;TOOLONG brain on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complexity before a state of insight is possible . <p> But on the other hand , the neural threshold that enables the full awakening of insight does n't just produce increasing degrees of scientific knowledge and technological innovation , but also increasing degrees of fragmentation , conflict and darkness . <p> Symbolic thought is inherently a separative mechanism , spilling over as division and fragmentation into the psychological , social and ecological dimensions . Therefore without sufficient self-questioning , attention and insight , thought ineluctably fragments the planet all to hell on which the adaptive leap evolved . That resolves one aspect of the riddle , but raises other questions . <p> If there 's an intrinsic drive in evolution toward higher consciousness , why is the state of insight so difficult to awaken , even for those with a strong contemplative propensity ? <p> Clearly , a conscious transmutation is required in a sentient species to end the impediment of thought and allow a true order of consciousness to emerge . But is that possible , except in the very few ? <p> I do n't know . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of symbolic thought is both a prerequisite and an obstacle to true consciousness , one feels the compassion of the cosmos for humankind , which is groping our way in self-made darkness toward it . <p> Far from putting man at the center , this ' theory of human nature ' provides both a religiously compatible and scientifically testable hypothesis . <p> Within decades , perhaps years , we 'll know whether the universe is ' fine tuned ' to evolve potentially intelligent life . We may also discover that whether everywhere life evolves to the point of sentience , beings possessing the potential for cosmic consciousness pass through a crisis of consciousness similar to what is presently coming to a head on earth . <p> There 's a mathematical elegance to the insight that higher thought is both a prerequisite and an obstacle to full consciousness . The existential contradiction begins to resolve ( and dissolve ) within one by the very perception and insight into it . <p> So will there be a turning point , when the transmutation of humankind ends the rampant division , conflict and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symbolic thought ? <p> I do n't know . But man ascending to de Chardin 's " Omega point " is not only illusory ; it 's the opposite . Creatures like man do not ' evolve , ' but deepen and widen their evolutionary contradiction until the crisis of consciousness is resolved , one way or another . <p> Man is generating more and more fragmentation on earth , and the planet and humanity ca n't absorb much more . We either radically change , or perish . If the latter , the cosmic Mind will shed a tear , and move on . The experiment is being carried out on many planets . <p> Since extinction , from our point of view , is n't an option , and since understanding the riddle of man is part of resolving the crisis of thought , the question becomes , can humankind make the turn before destroying the earth and our spiritual potential ? <p> There is a tragic irony in Teilhard de Chardin saying : " The Age of Nations is past . The task before us now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " when nationalism is as virulent now as it was when de Chardin died at the middle of the 20th century . <p> Besides , humans can not " build the Earth . " Seeing when to build , and when to be still is much more important than knowing what to build and where to build it . <p> Without implying teleology ( much less " intelligent design " ) , there is a tremendous mystery at the core of evolution , something that goes far beyond man-made meanings and history . <p> The universe is pressing these questions . Even so , philosophical insights into the cosmic contradiction of man , however accurate , can not substitute for the arduous work of bringing about the requisite transmutation within oneself . That 's the responsibility of each person , without recourse to any authority , be it religious or scientific . <p> That said , this is the first adequate explanation for the contradiction of man , and it helps to allay the rampant misanthropy so many people around the world now feel . In part , that stems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a random and meaningless species overrunning the Earth . <p> When thought is completely quiet , the brain is like a very sensitive antenna , receiving and reflecting awareness far beyond imagining . <p> If we do n't destroy our capacity for awareness , but develop it as much as we can in our short span on this mortal coil , we can awaken intimations or more of the cosmic mind within our own silent brain . More than anything else that will help humankind take our rightful place on earth and in the universe . <p> Whether we squat at the end of man 's spiritual development , or stand at the true beginning of the human being , is up to each one of us .

" Some fruit ; some capital . <p> Advertisement - scroll to continue reading <h> Are you getting our free newsletter ? <p> The company 's indelible staining of Latin America 's politics was ingloriously affirmed with its role in overthrowing the democratically elected Guatemalan leader Jacobo ? rbenz , whose expropriating measures to award property to landless citizens proved too much . The resulting Washington-backed coup , encouraged by such figures as United Fruit 's main shareholder Samuel Zemurray , resulted in a military dictatorship leading to 200,000 deaths . <p> In 1954 , with the coup in full swing , ? rbenz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of anti-communism " had been cited to overthrow his government . " The truth is very different . The truth is to be found in the financial interests of the fruit company and other US monopolies which have invested great amounts of money in Latin America and fear that the example of Guatemala would be followed by other Latin American countries " . <p> There is good reason then to take a rather withering view of the banana trade . It has become the feature fruit of monstrous monopolies , a brutal currency of exchange , the means by which exploitation has been cultivated for huge corporate gain . In some cases , its pricing has been kept low as the costs in production , be they in terms of land and people . They are the unwanted ghosts in the unaccounted equation . <p> Following the fruit to lands of its cultivation is to take a journey to inequality . The island of Mindanao in the Philippines produces 84% of the country 's bananas and hosts 25% of the country 's population . On that same island live over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was only the advent of the cooperative FARMCOOP and the passing of the Land Reform Law that enabled landless , indigent farmers to claim some degree of autonomy from the crushing conditions of the international banana market . <p> After the viciousness of imperialism , exploitation and profit , the banana now faces something of a different challenge . Climate , it has become trite to say , is playing up . The banana moguls , sellers and cultivators are getting anxious . Supply lines and prices are being affected . " Producers like Guatemala , El Salvador , and Costa Rica , will see a negative impact of rising temperatures over the next few decades , " predicts a confident Dan Bebber , a student of crop pathogens and sustainable agriculture . <p> Climate disruptions have also been something of an encouragement to threatening diseases to the crop , notably the TR4 fungus . The World Banana Forum , which benignly sounds like the Sorghum Appreciation Society with polite tea breaks and conference papers , offered a stolid seriousness . The BBC was there to gather some material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lu , a senior economist at the UN 's Food and Agriculture Organisation ( FAO ) : the impact of climate change was such as to pose an " enormous threat " to banana production . <p> CBS News was also at hand to be told by Sabine Altendorf , yet another economist at the UNFAO with an interest in supply chains of agricultural products , that any such infection would essentially doom the crop . " Once a plantation has been infected , it can not be eradicated . There is no pesticide or fungicide that is effective . " <p> Lu offers a diplomatic splash on the whole matter . He speaks of certification , keeping the bananas " greener " ( no irony intended ) and extols the value of such regulations as " they help producers seize the opportunity of making their production systems more sustainable . " Inevitably , he offers the following : " But of course , they also come with costs for producers because they require more control and monitoring systems on the part of the producers and the traders . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Ultimately , such certification remains overwhelmingly voluntary , by which the producers pay a fee for the process , thereby receiving price premiums and market access for upholding certain market standards . <p> The environmental ledger for humanity , and much of the globe , engenders worry . Climate change is dooming us in various ways . States and communities will be submerged . Droughts will empty tracts of land of agrarian occupation . Agricultural patterns will alter . It is making the cultivation of crops in certain areas of the world unfeasible and untenable .

@@107053239 <p> In a move that could exacerbate land dispossession and discrimination against Indigenous Peoples , the passage by the Royal Government of Cambodia of the Environment and Natural Resources Code ( Royal Kram No . NS/RKM/0623/007 ) poses a significant threat to social , cultural , and economic rights of Indigenous communities . The Code also directly contravenes the rights of Indigenous communities , sparking concerns of intensified land grabbing and violence . <p> The enactment of Cambodia 's Environment and Natural Resources Code represents a critical juncture in the country 's legal landscape . It grants a latitude of power to private interests to exploit natural resources in the name of " sustainable economic development " , at the expense of Indigenous land rights . This Code threatens the very existence and autonomy of Indigenous communities by blurring out indigeneity and their inherent rights to develop indigenous domains , cementing a system of discrimination and land dispossession . <h> Legalized land dispossession ? <p> In a National Consensus Consultative Workshop held on 19 December 2023 , representatives from Indigenous communities hailed from 12 provinces ( Kratie , Ratanakiri , Mondulkiri , Stung Treng , Preah Vihear , Kampong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Banteay Meanchey , Sihanoukville and Battambang ) have jointly denounced the threat the Environment and Natural Resources Code has posed to their collective rights as Indigenous Peoples . Through a joint statement of Indigenous community representatives , the 189-strong delegates stressed the lack of Free , Prior and Informed Consent ( FPIC ) in the designation of management zones that encroach indigenous lands and territories , fearing the restriction and prohibition of entry to their territories and deprivation of land ownership , thereby affecting various aspects of their lives that are greatly connected to the land . Further , they have feared that " as long as Indigenous Peoples continue to assert customary ownership in their current areas , they will suffer legal fines , transitional fines , litigation or authoritative forces , imprisonment , convictions , coercion , intimidation " and various forms of violence and repression . <p> Advertisement - scroll to continue reading <h> Are you getting our free newsletter ? <p> Indigenous leaders have since called for the inclusion of FPIC process ensuring the right to self-determination and governance of Indigenous communities , and to repeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 364 which gives overbreadth authority to the Ministry of Environment on land titling , and instead to expedite the process of registering indigenous lands and the recognition of cultural and heritage sites . <p> " The potential ramification of Cambodia 's Environment and Natural Resources Code is dire , and failure to repeal such policy could exacerbate land grabbing and violence , which are already prevalent issues faced by Indigenous Peoples in Cambodia " cautioned Beverly Longid of the International Indigenous Peoples Movement for Self-Determination and Liberation ( IPMSDL ) , highlighting how the management of environment and natural resources in the name of " sustainable economic development " is weaponized against Indigenous peoples , enforced in most cases through violence and repressive forms . <p> The Environment and Natural Resources Code will further expand the existing overlapping of areas between economic and land concessions , and protected areas , with the former encroaching indigenous territories . <h> A global trend and challenge <p> " The weaponization of laws to disregard Indigenous peoples ' rights to land and self-determination is a global trend " said Jiten Yumnam , co-Convenor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries . In the Philippines , the imminent threat of Charter Change would worsen landlessness . The legalization of Marco Temporal as a state policy in Brazil would invalidate Indigenous Peoples claims to their lands and would open up the Amazon , one of the few remaining frontiers of the Earth , to capitalist extraction and exploitation . Legislating laws to accelerate so-called development is happening across continents , and it is almost always used against Indigenous communities " he added . <p> Upholding Indigenous land rights is essential for environmental sustainability and natural resource conservation , objectives ostensibly targeted by the new Environment and Natural Resources Code . " We are not against development . But development for whom ? What kind of development ? " said Yumnam . <p> " It is a vested interest of the Indigenous peoples to protect the environment , to hone practices from across generations that utilize natural resources in a restrained and sustainable manner . Therefore , not until States recognize the huge potential of tapping Indigenous practices , recognize their right to self-determination , and their security of tenure in owning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the environment truly protected .

@@107053240 <p> FIANZ , the national Muslim umbrella organisation , confirms that the first delivery of humanitarian food aid from NZ organized by us has reached Gaza , said Br Ibrar Sheikh , President of FIANZ . It has been a major logistics exercise for us to ensure we can provide cooked food during this fasting month of Ramadhan , said Abdur Razzaq , Chairperson FIANZ RCOI and Advocacy .

@@107179231 <h> The Chasm Between TB And HIV Continues <p> " The two worst global health problems have combined forces well . But the institutions addressing them have miserably failed to put their act together , " wrote Dr Tim France , a noted global health thought leader , in an op-ed article titled " The chasm between TB and HIV " which was widely published in several newspapers of high TB burden countries in Asia Pacific and Africa in 2006 . <p> Even after 18 years since then , his words remain deeply relevant . Eamonn Murphy , Director , UNAIDS Asia Pacific and UNAIDS Eastern Europe and Central Asia , opened his keynote address in the End TB Dialogues Summit held recently , underlining the importance of bringing TB and HIV services together and strikingly called upon the dire need to ' break the silos ' -- a clarion call which Dr France had also unequivocally given through his op-ed of almost two decades back ! <p> " Many of the TB and HIV programmes are operating in isolation and almost in conflict with each other and it is not helping the patients co-infected with TB and HIV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HIV and TB service access in Asia Pacific " said Eamonn . <p> Asia Pacific is home to 21% of those who are co-infected with TB and HIV . " One-third of HIV treatment service providers do not provide TB treatment and three-fourth of TB service providers do not provide HIV treatment . This gap has got bigger overtime , and we need to work collectively to bring this down and make the programmes connect and work together " said Eamonn . <p> Advertisement - scroll to continue reading <h> Are you getting our free newsletter ? <p> " I have been to hospitals where in the compound you have a TB clinic in one part , and an HIV clinic in the other part - and the staff never talk . Only a quarter of countries in the Asia Pacific region include TB preventative treatment in their national HIV policies and guidelines , " added Eamonn . Over 1.9 million people living with HIV had received TB preventive treatment in 2022 globally . <p> " The ' one patient two clinics ' bottlenecks of TB HIV care - must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programming that is a fully integrated model of care where all services for both TB and HIV are provided in a single facility and by the same service providers . We need to bring the ' silos ' together , " said Eamonn . <h> Even one TB or HIV death is a death too many <p> " As per the latest WHO Global TB Report 2023 , around 48,000 people were co-infected with HIV and TB , and 11,000 of them died of TB in India . When TB is preventable and curable then even one TB death is a death too many . No one needs to die of HIV or TB , " said Professor ( Dr ) Dilip Mathai , President of AIDS Society of India ( ASI ) , and former Head of Medicine Department , Christian Medical College Vellore . He gave an unequivocal call to find all TB , treat all TB , and prevent all TB among people living with HIV . <p> Bridge the gap between " what we know " and " what we do " <p> Science has gifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dies either of HIV or TB , and no one gets infected with either of them - provided - we bridge the gap between ' what we do ' and ' what we know works . ' <p> We have highly accurate diagnostic tests ( molecular tests ) to diagnose TB , latest treatments which are less toxic , shorter , and more effective , and evidence-based ways to prevent TB and stop the spread . We have proven ways to ' reach the unreached ' with people-centred and community-driven " lab on the wheels " and provide a range of TB and HIV healthcare services on people 's doorsteps ( or as closer to the communities as possible ) . <p> Despite knowing how to break the chain of TB transmission and reduce human suffering , over 10.6 million people suffered through the disease and 1.3 million died in 2022 globally ( as per the WHO Global TB Report 2023 ) . More than half of those diagnosed with TB in 2022 , got a TB test that underperforms ( microscopy ) and not a molecular test upfront . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good HIV tests , lifesaving antiretroviral therapy and science to show that if a person is virally suppressed then undetectable equals untransmittable ( U equals U which means there is zero risk of transmission of HIV virus from the person to anyone else ) . " We can end AIDS now as science has shown us the evidence on how to stop the spread of HIV infection and keep people living with HIV healthy . To end AIDS , we need to ensure that no one is excluded , " said Dr Ishwar Gilada , President Emeritus at the 15th National Conference of the AIDS Society of India ( ASICON 2024 ) and Governing Council member of International AIDS Society ( IAS ) . <h> Deadly nexus When a virus and a bacteria work together <p> " When a virus ( HIV ) and a bacteria ( TB ) can work so well together - why can not we ? " had said Michel Sidibe in 2009 . Michel Sidibe was UNAIDS Executive Director back then and speaking to CNS ( Citizen News Service ) at the Stop TB Partnership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Brazil . <p> Despite knowing how to protect people with HIV from TB , 167000 people who were living with HIV died of TB in 2022 globally . HIV continues to be the 2nd biggest risk factor for TB worldwide ( undernutrition is the largest risk factor globally ) . Almost a million new TB cases were attributed to HIV as a risk factor ( out of 10.6 million people ) in 2022 worldwide . <p> " TB remains the leading cause of death for people living with HIV globally . In 2021 , almost one-third of AIDS-related deaths were due to TB . Yet we dare to imagine a world where we find all TB , treat all TB , and prevent all TB among people living with HIV and others in the community , " said Eamonn Murphy of UNAIDS . <h> Eamonn Murphy calls for integration and inclusion <p> UNAIDS regional leader Eamonn Murphy said that TB and HIV collaborative activities have shone a spotlight on the value of ' breaking out of the silos ' to tackle both diseases in a coordinated manner . Globally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with HIV . <p> " Our best successes have been in countries and communities where they have brought these silos together . 13 million TB deaths were averted among HIV positive people between 2000 and 2021 . We have seen a 67% drop in TB-related deaths among people living with HIV since 2010 globally . We are within reach of the 80% decline target for TB-related deaths among people living with HIV by 2025 , " he said . <p> " Perhaps our target was not as ambitious as it could have been , but we still have a long way to go to make sure we can achieve that and there are many other targets and competing demands in the current environment that are challenging us " he shared . <h> Progress against TB and HIV has plateaued <p> Progress has plateaued particularly since COVID-19 service interruptions . " Only 46% of the estimated 73,000 people living with HIV who developed TB in 2021 were able to access antiretroviral therapy . This is the same level as of 2020 , " shared Eamonn . Overall , TB cases in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2015 and 2022 among people with HIV . <p> More importantly , Eamonn pointed towards the difference between countries in responding to TB and HIV dual epidemics . " Over 75% of people diagnosed with TB accessed HIV testing and knew their status in 2022 but there is dramatically unequal progress between countries in Asia Pacific region . " Only 58% of people with TB-HIV co-infection knew their status in 2022 and less than half of them ( 42% ) were on antiretroviral therapy . In India , over three-fourth of people with TB and HIV co-infection were on antiretroviral therapy whereas in the Philippines only one in five of them were receiving the therapy . " The data tells us perennial story that people continue to be left behind . " <p> " We need a well-coordinated and persistent approach to both TB and HIV , for the delivery of comprehensive quality services , " said Eamonn . " We need a response that is strongly connected to the Universal Health Coverage ( UHC ) agenda and the 2030 sustainable development agenda . We can not talk about achieving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standalone programmes and approaches . " <h> Engage the people we serve <p> " Biomedical HIV and TB prevention and treatment strategies have saved millions of lives , but they are insufficient to meet our goals to end TB or AIDS . We know from more than four decades of building and refining the AIDS response that we have to involve the users of the health services in their design , planning and implementation -- at every level and stage . That is why communities at risk must be at the centre of everything we do , " said Eamonn Murphy of UNAIDS . <p> We only have 80 months left to deliver on all SDGs which includes the targets of ending AIDS and TB worldwide ( by 2030 ) .

@@107179232 <h> New Zealand 's oldest provincial cinema in Raetihi will re-open in April for movies <p> March 27 , 2024 -- Gary Griffin-Chappel , Chairperson of the Theatre Royal ( Waimarino ) Charitable Trust announced today that after some repair work and repaint of part of the theatre , the theatre will again be able to host movies . To celebrate this a re-opening ceremony and documentary film premiere of ' Paddlewheels on the Wanganui ' , will be held on the 27th of April 2024 commencing at 7pm . <p> Mr Griffin-Chappel went on to say that " The Royal Theatre , also termed Theatre Royal Raetihi , was built in 1915 as a movie theatre , by a renowned local sawmill owner John Punch . Being designed by Whanganui Architect Thomas Battle , it is reported to be the oldest independently built cinema in New Zealand and the oldest provincial Cinema in New Zealand still in existence . <p> The theatre had a long period as a cinema , being run by the Thompson family for many years up until , we believe , the late 1980 's when it was closed .

With the nearest cinemas an hour away north or south and having spoken with local people we feel there is a need to bring the cinema back to life . " <p> With this in mind Mr. Griffin-Chappel searched for information on operating a cinema and was lucky to find Mr. Graeme Moffatt , who had just completed the task of restoring Dannevirke 's Regent Cinema to an operational status after being closed for ten years , and asked if he would be willing to provide some guidance and support on their journey to return the golden years of the movies to the region . <p> Mr. Moffatt who is also a documentary filmmaker , has already screened a documentary onto the back wall of the theatre in 2015 , using his own projector and sound system as there were no equipment available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theatre in early August 2023 and after discussing what was required he confirmed that he is more than happy to assist in getting the theatre back to operating as a cinema once again . <p> Graeme began looking around for some secondhand equipment for a sound system and projector , and after finding a suitable projector , this was purchased along with a surround sound system . <p> A local farmer donated some seasoned logs off his farm and these were milled at the local sawmill , to provide sufficient timber to construct a seven by three metre frame to support a stretched fabric screen , which has now successfully been completed . <p> The theatre is now ready to screen movies and the first will be the Premiere of Mr. Moffatt 's latest documentary titled ' Paddlewheels on the Wanganui ' , which is based on a book of the same name published in 1967 . <p> The story relates to the exploits of a Hatrick riverboat engineer , who worked in a variety of river boats on the Whanganui River between 1912 and 1919 , and as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the closest cinema to the area where the boats operated , it was chosen as the ideal location for the premiere . <p> This event will take place on Saturday 27th April 2024 commencing at 7.00pm , and will coincide with a re-opening celebration for invited guests for the screening of movies , and will comprise of the screening of a number of films , including the iconic ' This is New Zealand ' , prior to the premiere screening . <h> Did you know Scoop has an Ethical Paywall ? <p> If you 're using Scoop for work , your organisation needs to pay a small license fee with Scoop Pro .

Transparency International New Zealand says that it is so watered down from an initial reasonable Ministry draft , to now totally lack substance , even though it is voluntary and non-binding . <p> Initially the Ministry of Justice developed a draft lobbying code of conduct based on those of similar democracies . As you would expect with professional codes the original draft genuinely addressed ' conduct ' - the moderation of behaviour and practice . But after consultation with government relations consultants for their feedback we now see the version out for consultation . <p> The difference between the initial draft based on international best practices and the current version is striking .

That 's thanks to additional boost and more precise control over the ignition spark timing ( gleaned from the Nissan GT-R apparently ) . <p> When you 're tracking it , a better oil cooler should keep it from expiring prematurely . <p> The Internet does n't like that the Nismo Z is only available with an auto trans but that 's modern sports cars for you . <p> It has been Nismo 'd however , delivering faster shifting ( via revised clutch packs ) and a racier shifter profile when you switch things up into the Nismo-specific Sport+ drive mode . <p> Nismo has made ' significant handling enhancements ' revising ' every element ' of the car 's suspension in the pursuit of ' precision and grip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiffer spring rates , new dampers and stiffer front and rear suspension bushes .

Unfortunately not light enough though as the Nismo puts more pressure on the scales ; at a claimed 1640kg , it 's nearly 80kg heavier than the Z. <p> Helping those suspension mods work more effectively , additional suspension bracing and chassis reinforcement make it stiffer ( by 2.5 per cent ... ) and the steering rack is more rigidly mounted . <h> The Nismo effect <p> Plonking ourselves into the Nismo 's Recaros , we prod the red go button and the rumble of the V6 awakening is a nice antidote to an EV 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet easy-to-use shifter and we 're away . Except something is beeping at us .

And when the Dunlops roll over coarse chip , they sure do rumble . <p> This was to be expected ; the lumps we can deal with , but the tyres are quite vocal and right rowdy at open road velocities . <p> Prodding the go pedal , the twin turbos quickly bulk out the V6 's torque curve , and it feels fairly brisk as we enter the motorway . The sports display on the instrument screen shows a big tacho in the centre flanked by temperature gauges and the all important G meter . <p> There 's no fuel use indicator though ; guess you do n't need to be bothering about that in the Nismo . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to silence the lane departure alert , though quickly decide this would be better done when stopped . <p> Being an older platform , there are n't too many beepers and bongers to worry about . But bits like blind spot monitors help in a low slung sportster . <h> Into Sport+ mode <p> Finding ourselves on more interesting , Nismo made roads , we up the ante , giving the V6 a burst . This is n't the most melodious six , it 's a bit gruff but still audible ( just ) over the rubber roar . <p> The six finds its mojo around three , and is really into it above 4000rpm , pulling well to just past six , where max power is tapped . It 'll head further north to 7000rpm , but it 's not all that necessary ( maybe on track ) . <p> On the road you can work that mid range and be happy as it 's particularly strong in the three to five zone . It 's faster too , clocking in at 4.5sec , making it about half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few more tenths in it had we remembered about the launch control and found a road with better grip . <p> When driving the regular Z , we took to the paddles as the auto was just too slow . Here things have improved , slightly . In the snappier Sport+ mode , it will work the engine over , making sure it never dips below 4000rpm . <p> It 's good when you 're on a hill road packed with tight corners where it 'll nail most of the shift points . But it can otherwise be a tad too enthusiastic , a track setting as they say . <p> In Sport mode , it 's still a tad lethargic at dropping a cog , and so back to the paddles , which initiate the gear changes quickly enough , though the downshifts could be snappier . <h> Corners better <p> When punting the regular Z along , it understeers sooner than it ought to and requires the odd adjustment at the wheel to keep it tracking round the bends . The Nismo is more resolute with better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still light on resistance and sensation , the Nismo turns with more vigour , its frontend locked on . While there is more torque trying to corrupt the traction , the big Dunlops do a good job of sticking it . <p> The long travel throttle helps manage the gas and you can introduce it quite thoroughly . The diff and rubber must be doing the job as you can induce some power on understeer if you 're a bit keen . <p> There 's much more lateral grip than you expect . It rotates quite quickly , and while it feels like it might let go if you force it , it hangs on stubbornly . Your trust in it builds , and it 's then quite rewarding . <p> It 's a little nerve inducing at times , but the stability control is also waiting patiently to help out .

@@107938231 <h> 2024 Cupra Leon V e-Hybrid Sportstourer review <h> Words : Kyle Cassidy Photos : Isaac Western <h> Cupra has added another PHEV to its range in the form of the Leon V e-hybrid . But is it bad timing for this plug-in ? <p> Cupra 's Leon ranks have been bolstered with a plug-in hybrid , available here in Sportstourer guise alone . This adds another petrol-electric option to the Cupra range , alongside the Cupra Formentor V e-Hybrid . <p> But with the axing of rebates and with road user charges to pay from April 1 ( no joke ) , these PHEVs now require more careful consideration . Is it the right fit for your needs , and is the premium worthwhile ? <p> Like many electric models to launch lately , the Cupra Leon plug-in is on special . It 's listed at $77,900 but currently it is offered at $69,990 . <p> That makes it slightly more palatable . However , the go-fast Leon VZ is also $69,990 , and is no longer slogged with a fee . This speedy wagon offers 228kW of turbo-fired power , AWD and a generous helping of dynamic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of torque ( the same in fact as the VZ ) thanks to its 110kW/250Nm 1.4-litre turbopetrol combining with a 85kW/335Nm electric motor . <p> Together they generate a total output of 180kW and 400Nm . The stat that will draw some in is the 1.2L/100km fuel consumption figure , though that comes with a caveat . You 'll only come close if you recharge regularly . <p> For instance , over the first 100km of travel in this Leon , we managed 1.0L/100km thanks to starting with a full battery and recharging it overnight . From that point on we neglected our charging , and the fuel use rose steadily ; after 290km it was at 5.2L/100km . <p> The long term average for this car over 1072km was sitting at 6.6L/100km . <p> The battery is said to deliver up to 58km of driving in e-mode ( where it is propelled by the electric motor alone ) whereas we recorded 45km to a charge twice . A refill via the supplied portable charger takes six hours , the battery soaking up 11.1kWh . <p> So it 's roughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but then the modest motor is tasked with lugging around the car , along with an engine and a tank of gas . <p> A similar-sized EV could expect to get about 16-17kWh/100km . But that is the hybrid compromise . <p> Now that plug-ins are having to pay both RUCs and tax at the pump , you 'll be wanting to use the plug as often as possible and the petrol pump sparingly . <p> At least with Cupra 's driveaway deal , your first tank of fuel is included , the price is the price , and your on roads are sorted too . <h> Okay but how does it drive ? <p> Got enough charge ? It 'll default to e-mode , where the 85kW motor is sufficient , given it has 330Nm and is operating with the help of the transmission . <p> It 's enough for urban commuting and works up to open road speeds as well . <p> There are a couple of hybrid-specific modes within the touchscreen menu where you can activate hybrid drive , should you prefer it , and there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later in your journey . <p> There 's also a pre-conditioning function ; set your departure time and the car will be heated or cooled to the desired level while using the mains power when plugged in . <p> While you can set the level of motor regen to high or low , it does the job well in its auto mode , coasting on a dead throttle and slowing when approaching traffic ahead . So we left it to control proceedings . <p> Once the battery is too low on watts to support the e-mode , you 're in hybrid setting . Here you get both the engine and motor working together , the regen allowing the latter to continue to help out . <p> It pulls well from stopped , and with its low down electric torque , this can haul second gear from a rolling start much better than the regular mild hybrid Leon . It 's smooth too , gear changes slick , and is particularly strong around the 2000rpm mark . <p> Therefore , there 's no need for an excess of revs to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tacho/power gauge indicates the motor is helping boost your progress to deliver the 180kW/400Nm max . <p> Countering that , it 'll take every opportunity to switch the engine off to lower the fuel consumption . <h> A practical plug-in <p> While there 's not quite the same overall boot capacity as the other Leon wagons , there 's still a handy 470L of space . And it 'll tow 750kg ( 1500kg braked ) . <p> There 's family-friendly passenger space in the rear , with adequate , if not amazing legroom . <p> The sporty seats up front deliver a decent driving position , with good adjustment and comfort . While charging is sorted with a charge pad and various USB ports , storage is a little tight and none of the pockets is lined , not even the glove box . <p> The infotainment screen looks vibrant with all the usual features present . However , while its response time is adequate , the layered menus require both familiarity and multiple touches to get things done . <p> The ambient lightning in the cabin is tasteful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems to alert you to impending doom . These assistants are n't too fanatical however . <p> The quick and light steering helps in traffic , and while there 's only a rear view camera , given this is n't a 2m wide SUV , it 's easy enough to park . Which means the self parking gizmo will likely go unused . <h> A real Cupra but ? <p> Dynamically this is sound , with good steering traits and a positive turn-in . While it obediently tracks around the bends , the one stat against the hybrid is weight . <p> It 's a claimed 1704kg , making it some 300kg heavier than the V. This takes the gloss off its performance , the extra mass telling and it 's just not as nimble as the mild hybrid . <p> There are the usual plug-in hybrid characteristics too ; the brake pedal action is inconsistent and , until you 're in the sporty modes , the powertrain response can be delayed as the engine switches in and out . <p> This has Cupra 's dynamic chassis control , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but are still able to breathe over the bumps . <p> Back in Comfort mode , the ride is more agreeable , though the big wheels transmit the larger bumps . <h> The $69,990 question <p> This V e-hybrid is a decent drive , and it might be a good bridge for those not ready to give up on combustion just yet , but want to reduce their transport-related emissions . <p> It 's easy to recharge for those who travel less than 50km during their daily business , while having the ability to roam further and more freely than an EV . <p> But even at its reduced price , it 's still hard to justify the premium over the talented $50,990 mild hybrid version . By comparison , that car returned 8.0L/100km when we had it on test . <p> Perhaps you could use the $20k saving to buy an e-bike for those short trips and plant some trees to help offset the additional carbon ? <p> NZ Autocar is New Zealand 's leading automotive magazine .

I left it in the parlour , It was your party and they were your friends , I see you got a nice new car and a brand new pair of pants . <p> So what 's it going to be New Zealand ? The Money or the Bag ? Do you want those sumptuous social services or would you rather just take the cash ? <p> Expectations are running hot . Tomorrow 's the day when all the pain and cuts will be worth it . All the pandering to Seymour and Winston pays off . The day when Nicola Willis will finally announce her long promised tax relief , saving the squeezed middle from becoming bottom feeders . Hurrah ! <h> What they said . <p> Before we begin this short news clip from the start of the week will help set the scene : <p> As we know National won the election by promising tax cuts . It was n't the only reason people voted for a change in government , but it 's fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> - Sponsor Promotion - <p> Helping kiwi families with a tax cut as the increased cost of living had diminished the purchasing power of their wages . National said we 'd get up to $250 a fortnight . Pretty hard to resist when you 're struggling to make ends meet and the price of everything keeps going up and up . <p> Tax cuts were not only their key policy but also a firm promise . A personal commitment from Nicola Willis that she 'd deliver them -- or resign . Although it 's fair to say that the Finance Minister , and the PM , have demonstrated rather less bravado since being elected . <p> They 've still been making positive noises about tax cuts , but they 've been mumbling while doing so , looking the other way when people ask if they 'll be getting as much as they were promised . <p> Nicola 's one page tax plan fell apart even before the government was formed . The anticipated revenue from selling off property to people overseas was kiboshed by Winston , although it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in the budget with a higher price threshold . Except perhaps to NZ First voters . <p> In better news Nicola discovered so called " Fiscal Cliffs " , which she hoped to use as a get-out-of-tax-cuts-free card . <p> " Do n't stop blaming Labour , you wo n't have to give any tax cuts , you 'll get to keep your job " <p> Unfortunately all the information about what was funded long term , and short term , was right there in black and white . Claiming a lack of awareness as an excuse just made Nicola sound like she had n't done her homework . <p> Lately people have been warning Nicola that despite all her spending cuts she 'd still have to borrow from future generations to pay for her tax cuts . As you might well imagine the perceived wisdom amongst economists is that borrowing for tax cuts is a really stupid idea . <p> Every day there seem to be more reasons and voices calling for her to think again , to listen to reason . The good folks at Big Hairy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ updates , and why she might dread receiving them : <p> The problem is the more that reality is taken into consideration the more that tax cuts look not only implausible but down right irresponsible . We ca n't afford them . <p> Now they 've begun talking about even more job cuts in the public sector . Christopher Luxon did n't seem to have much of a clue how many yesterday , so either he 's not particularly well informed , not overly interested , or maybe there 'll be some surprises in the budget after all . Like a weta in your gumboot . <p> It 's simple mathematics -- if your numbers do n't add up just a wack a few more civil servants . Although at some point people will probably start noticing a reduction in services .

" <p> Luxon smugly answered his questions saying , " as your former Finance Minister used to say , ' Two more sleeps to go . ' " Which is fair enough . Grant Robertson did used to say that , and quite gleefully as I recall . <p> But this is not the same . Christopher was n't being asked to divulge some secret plan to get things back on track . By which I mean the polls . He was being asked to confirm whether he 's going to deliver the specific promises he made at the election . I 'm guessing it would n't be a secret if the answer had been " yes " . <p> Luxon did n't say much beyond that , a bit more evasion , treating the things that many of us are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Suffice to say you were n't overly optimistic . <h> What do you hope for/fear from the budget ? <p> Keith said he 'd like to see a " reversal of the landlord handout , instead fitting every state house with solar panels and batteries for free ! I do miss the old Tui Billboards . " <p> Forget about the tax cuts that will be announced tomorrow , the government should have simply said , " we ca n't afford a three billion dollar tax cut for landlords right now .

I 'm dreading more items being transferred to councils at ratepayers expense . " <p> You can see that happening already . National want things off the books . Be it shelving Three Waters , leaving the infrastructure costs to ratepayers , or wanting to move Kainga Ora 's debt into some other entity . <p> Helen said she wanted to see " an increase to benefits and no tax on the first $20K , which would be helpful to low income earners .

Te Pati Maori , they 're completely free to protest as long as it 's legal . " <p> Image : Darren Watson . <p> Christopher would prefer you not to make a fuss on Nicola 's big day . He suggests doing something in the weekend , you know when business districts and politicians wo n't be disrupted . You would n't want to disappoint him , would you ? <p> Oh , and please resist the urge to tell me National have a mandate to do all this . That this is just democracy at work .

@@108617238 <p> As the full , sweeping effects of the latest Budget start to be realised , it 's crucial to remember that it sits on the cornerstone of our founding rights and constitutional document , te Tiriti o Waitangi . At the moment , Maori are responding to a rhetoric that does n't seem to recognise our existence . And the Budget appears to reflect that . <p> Before te Tiriti o Waitangi , there was no annual Budget . <p> Iwi , hapu and whanau up and down the country were engaged in highly productive trade - with each other and the foreign travellers increasingly arriving on their doorstep . The relative wealth of Maori at this time is well documented . <p> It was with this wealth , and the reinforcing of their tino rangatiratanga through the Declaration of Independence in 1835 , He Whakaputanga , that Maori then engaged with the British Crown in the signing of te Tiriti o Waitangi . <p> Yet things changed for the worse after 1840 . As Queen Elizabeth II euphemistically described it in 1990 , " Today we are strong enough and honest enough to learn the lesson of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treaty has been imperfectly observed . " <p> In the more direct words of Papa Moana Jackson : " To honour the Treaty we must first settle colonisation . " <p> The wealth that Maori had was systematically stolen from us . The whenua that we lived on was taken by the Crown , what we traded became the Crown 's , and what we spoke became the Crown 's language . <p> Recent surveys show that the public has more understanding about te Tiriti and the impacts of colonisation on Maori than the heated political rhetoric might lead us to believe . And while there are differing views on te Tiriti , in a survey commissioned by Te Kahui Tika Tangata Human Rights Commission in 2023 , we found that most people in Aotearoa want us all to move forward by listening more and ensuring that decisions about te Tiriti are made on a truly equal footing between Maori and the Crown . <p> It 's this context that we need to bear in mind as we look at the government 's Budget . Does the way the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a nation ? Does it increase our ability to listen to each other ? Does it fulfil the Crown 's te Tiriti obligation to actively protect Maori from harm and protect the rights of Maori as indigenous peoples ? And does it get us closer to truly honouring te Tiriti o Waitangi ? <p> The short answer to these questions is " no " . Budget 2024 has almost no extra funding for Maori development . In fact , as Te Ao Maori News has reported : " A working couple earning the median Maori income ( $50,238 for the year ended June 2023 ) with no kids and no superannuation will get $70.13 per fortnight , and $1,823.50 per year returned in tax cuts . But a couple earning the median Pakeha ( NZ European ) income ( $60,790 for the year ended June 2023 ) with the same parameters will get $101.50 per fortnight , roughly 1.4 times the tax cuts for the median working Maori couple . " <p> How can we strive for equality when our starting point is so dramatically different ? <p> As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of almost $50 million over three years of funding for Te Matatini . But the cynic in me also thinks , there is funding for the performance of our culture but not the lived experience of it . As it happens , Te Matatini injected at least $22 million into the Auckland economy in 2023 . <p> The strike action carried out by thousands of people across the motu on Thursday aimed to be a show of economic force - to demonstrate to our government that despite our unequal footing , Maori are workers , taxpayers and constituents whose significant contributions to society matter . I urge our decision-makers to recognise that the success of Maori will lead to the success of all people who call Aotearoa home . The Tiriti relationship is a founding fabric of Aotearoa and remains yet to be honoured . <p> Regardless , the right of Maori to exercise tino rangatiratanga remains as unmovable as the moko kauae on my face . That right sits in our whakapapa and is recognised in te Tiriti o Waitangi . It is not determined by any government budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 
@@108617240 <p> It 's not so much the axe being swung in this budget as the pendulum . The centre-right is back in charge and is getting on with its core business - shrinking the size of government . <p> National has - as promised - knelt before its one true god : tax cuts . By changing tax thresholds , National has reduced personal income tax for the first time since 2010 . A whopping $14.7 billion is going into tax cuts over four years , almost exactly the $14.6b Finance Minister Nicola Willis said it would cost during the Election 2023 campaign . <p> The main change of tack , which we 've known about since the coalition agreements were signed , is the scrapping of a proposed foreign buyers ' tax , which would have helped to pay for the cuts . It was always a mythology anyway . Instead , cuts have been made - " savings " and " reprioritisations " if you prefer the government 's language - to deliver on National 's promise . And it will borrow more . <p> Willis promised an operating allowance of $3.2b , lower than Labour 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is the lowest in real terms since 2017 . She noted that in 2023 , Labour 's operating allowance had reached $4.8b . For this government , size matters . The smaller the better . <p> What little new money there is goes to health ( more security , maintaining hospitals ) , education ( more buildings ) and law and order ( more police , more pay ) , although most of that will do little more than maintain the status quo . <p> There are no surprises and little sleight of hand here . The good news for democracy is that New Zealanders will wake up the morning after Budget day to knowledge they will get almost exactly what they expected when they woke up the morning after election day , which is the agenda that the majority of New Zealanders voted for . <p> The political question , now that National 's laser-like focus on tax has been delivered , is will voters like what they 've got - and what they 've given up to get it ? And what 's not on the list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the promise that delights . <p> The harsh reality for the government is that voters have already psychologically banked their tax cut , well before they bank the actual cash . There will be little excitement - or poll movement - for a National government delivering tax cuts . It 's like summer sun or winter rain - just to be expected . <p> What 's likely to be more front of mind for many is that the government 's way of easing the cost of living pressure comes at the expense of other ways of easing the cost of living pressure . Gone are the subsidised bus fares , increases to benefits by indexing payments to wages rather than inflation , plans to increase the smoking age and ban smoking for future generations , free prescriptions , first year fees-free for students ( moving to final year free ) , the clean car discount and so on . Now , you can toss in cuts to the Human Rights Commission , NZ Symphony Orchestra , and the Warmer Kiwi Homes scheme . They 're all being trimmed to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? How about plans to help GPs whose funding formulas mean many are barely hanging on ? More state houses ? Given that last year 's Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Update ( PREFU ) said any economic growth will largely be based on immigration growth and we already have an infrastructure deficit estimated at more than $200b , how about a serious commitment to infrastructure spending ? The two big items in this year 's infrastructure budget are more roads and a new prison . Is that enough to prepare us for a rapidly changing climate , ageing population and record numbers of new New Zealanders ? <p> Place that alongside the changes to smoking and benefit policies and the government has made it very easy for opposition parties to argue it is the most vulnerable who are paying for these tax cuts . When the government has also chosen to stick with its near $3b boost to landlords with the return of interest deductibility on rental properties , National has delivered a fiscal plan that is exactly what it promised , but also exactly what opposition parties will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads sadly over the next year and say : " We warned you . The poor subsidising the rich , how predictably National . " <p> What 's more , National has - in what will be the most discomfiting move for its MPs and party members - committed to a $12b increase in borrowing over the next four years . Willis insists she is not borrowing to pay for tax cuts , because that is at odds with her promise to return the government to fiscal discipline . But the truth is that the government could not afford the tax cuts delivered on Budget day without both cuts and borrowing . <p> So the bottom line for Budget 2024 is that National ( to ACT 's delight ) has shrunk the government 's bottom line . But here 's the real news from Budget 2024 , and it 's all about Budget 2025 and 2026 . After this year , the moderating influences of an election campaign fade into the rearview mirror . Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has called this Budget a " careful Budget " . But after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful . The shrinking government will continue to shrink over the rest of the term , down to what RNZ 's business editor Gyles Beckford has called its " barest of bare bones " . <p> The government 's spending allowance for the next two years is a mere $2.4b a year - half what Labour spent in 2023 . And roughly half of that is committed to health . The room for new spending , new programmes and ideas , as well as dealing with emergencies , is almost non-existent . This government is promising the status quo , but no more . What you see is what you are going to keep getting . <p> And if you 're tempted to shrug and say Willis will spend more when the pressure comes on , remember how determinedly she has kept her promises this year . And hear her when she said of those $2.4b allowances , " we intend to stick to them " . Government cuts , she says , will be " business as usual " . <p> Willis is betting on a growing private sector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That just like the 2010s , house prices and immigration will be enough to satisfy voters as the government does less .

" <p> Ware said special challenges of the Mangamuka project included keeping workers safe while heavy machinery was moving up and down a narrow corridor , high rainfall , steep terrain , and the way the ground kept moving . <p> Postma said other complicating factors included the area 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - 2800mm instead of the annual average of 1700mm . <p> Factors that helped the project included " the great people that are up here " . <p> Postma said he was often asked why a road tunnel was not drilled through the ranges instead . <p> He said the area 's geology made it unsuitable for tunnelling , and the cost would be measured not in millions but in billions of dollars . <p> Lead contractor CLL communications manager Kylie Harris said the closure of Mangamuka Gorge had a profound effect on families such as hers . <p> She lives in Kaitaia but used to travel often to Tautoro , south of Kaikohe , where her father was from and where many whanau events such as tangi and wananga were held . <p> The detour via State Highway 10 had increased the travel time from one hour to just under two hours , so she was unable to make the trip , or connect with relatives on the south side of the gorge , as often as she used to . <p> The reopening of the highway would mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she said . <p> It would , however , also be bittersweet , because she had made lifelong friends among the workers in the isolated gorge . <p> Harris said being involved in a project of such significance had given her , and her co-workers , a sense of pride . <p> According to a Waka Kotahi briefing document , of the 15 slips deemed as critical , three had so far been repaired with another three nearing completion . <p> At those locations the road had been rebuilt by driving piles of just over 1m in diameter up to 32m into the ground . <p> The piles were then capped with a concrete beam and anchored using steel cables driven up to 35m into the hillside . <p> The same design was used to repair the two worst slips after the earlier deluge in 2020 . Those repairs withstood the 2022 and 2023 storms . <p> The most complex slip , called A11 , is about 20m deep and extends some 200m up the hillside . <p> An estimated 30,000 cubic metres of soil has to be removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slip . <p> As of Friday , 21,000 cubic metres had been shifted using giant dump trucks previously used on the Brynderwyn project . <p> Other aspects of the project include improving drainage , for example by replacing existing culverts with new ones two to three times the size , so the road would be better able to handle future downpours . <p> The new culverts would be fitted with steps and rocks to allow fish to travel upstream , and eDNA testing had been carried out to determine which species were present in the area 's streams . <p> Electronic bat monitoring equipment was used to check for bat roosts before trees are felled , and sniffer dogs were deployed to check for kiwi . <p> So far no kiwi had been found , but plenty of pupurangi ( kauri snails ) , tusked weta and skinks had been relocated away from work sites . <p> Much of the rock that forms the Maungataniwha Range , including Mangamuka Gorge , is a type known to geologists as Northland allochthon - or , more vividly , as " Northland problematic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> More from Newshub <p> Despite Mental Health Minister Matt Doocey having previously acknowledged growing workforce vacancies and skyrocketing rates of mental distress across New Zealand , " his words had not been backed by action in the Coalition government 's first budget " , he said . <p> " Every day , people experiencing serious mental health or addiction issues are falling through the cracks . <p> " From an economic perspective , it 's short-sighted .

@@108716234 <h> If your kid just told you they 're trans , here 's what you should know <p> Maryhope Howland gave birth to a baby she thought was a boy . But at 6 years old , the child asked her questions such as " Mom , am I a boy ? How do you know I 'm a boy ? " <p> " Once I clued in , I said , ' The doctors make a best guess based on your body ... but only you can know , and we love you no matter what , ' " said Howland , now co-lead for the Families United for Trans Rights , an organization of transgender kids and their loved ones . <p> Her child 's questioning did n't stop there . It marked the beginning of a yearslong evolution not just for her daughter , who came out as nonbinary at age 8 and transgender at 10 . It was also a journey for Howland and her husband as they navigated what it means to be trans , ways of affirming their daughter 's gender identity , their responsibilities as parents , and the grief associated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going to be , " Howland said . <p> " One of the hardest things for us to do as parents is pause when that vision gets interrupted and really listen to what our kiddos are saying to us , " said Nova Bright-Williams , a trans woman who is head of internal training at the Trevor Project , a suicide prevention and crisis organization for LGBTQ+ youth . <p> Listening to a child 's experience can be difficult for many parents , regardless of their political or religious beliefs . <p> But there 's good reason to try . " Research is constantly showing that LGBTQ young people report lower rates of attempting suicide when they have access to affirming spaces , communities ( and ) adults , " Bright-Williams said . <p> CNN spoke with a doctor , gender rights activists and parents of trans children about what to say when a child comes out as transgender , how to address certain challenges and what receiving gender-affirming care is like . Here 's what they want you to know . <h> The coming out conversation <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ female at birth and had been showing aversion to the trappings of girlhood . When Cornwell asked Evan at age 4 if he were upset he was born a girl , Evan 's answer shocked her : " Yes , Mommy . I told God when I was a star in the sky that I was a boy , but God made me a girl , and now I just have to live with it . " <p> " It seemed that my child knew something very deep and true about himself , and that he had an awareness of how his identity was also wrapped up in his relationship with God , " Cornwell , a pastor at Dumbarton United Methodist Church in Washington , DC , and author of " Daring Adventures : Helping Gender-Diverse Kids and Their Families Thrive , " said via email . " We started to go to therapy as a family and just after Evan turned 6 , he decided that he wanted to use male pronouns and a new name , at first just at home . " <p> Cornwell initially felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is common for many parents , experts said . But these discussions can also create a moment of joyful bonding for families , said Dr. Kade Goepferd , medical director of gender health at pediatric health system Children 's Minnesota . <p> It 's also common for a child 's revelations about gender identity to provide a sense of clarity and relief for parents who have been witnessing behavioral and mood issues for which they could n't pinpoint a cause , Goepferd added . <p> Other parents have always noticed their child has never quite fit into gendered expectations and feel the conversation is a confirmation . That was the case for Cornwell , whose son had preferred typical boys ' clothes , hairstyles and activities since preschool . He had also started to ask when he would develop breasts and said that whenever he did , he was going to cut them off . <p> Some parents want to support their child but worry if their gender identity is the result of a phase , or if they 'll change their mind later . But the consensus of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind one day -- which is rare -- that 's OK . It would be their decision resulting from the exploration of their gender identity , rather than someone trying to control it for them . <p> " There 's really no harm in ever affirming or loving our kids when they share with us who they are , " Goepferd said . " The harm really can only come if we refuse to listen or acknowledge the truth that they 're sharing with us and how vulnerable they 're being . " <p> Rejecting them could not only cause hurt and anger but also could ruin chances of a long-term relationship . Therefore , when your child tells you they 're trans , your first response should be to thank them for sharing and learning about their experience , Bright-Williams said . Say you want to get to know more about this part of who they are . Ask how long they 've known this about themselves , who else they 've shared their identity with and how you can support them . <p> Jocelyn Rhynard 's son , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frosting a cake he 'd baked with the phrase " I am NB . " " I was like , ' That 's awesome . Congratulations , ' " she said . <p> Rhyland 's son later realized he is trans masculine nonbinary and uses he/him pronouns , and he 's OK with Rhyland calling him her son . ( Trans masculine nonbinary means someone 's gender identity is nonbinary , yet they present in a typically masculine fashion with their name , style and more . ) <p> If you feel fear , concern , bias or grief , process that away from your child , said experts and parents , who also emphasized the importance of learning about transness by doing your own research . Do n't rely solely on your child to guide you . <h> Forms of gender affirmation <p> Not every transgender person feels the need for any or all forms of changing their gender expression or their body , experts said . When older children come out , they typically already have chosen a new name , pronouns and more . <p> But if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need , you can have conversations over time about what stylistic choices , hobbies and toys help them feel most like themselves , Bright-Williams said . Many children are n't in a rush to make these changes , experts and parents said -- some experiment at home for a while before debuting a new style or name at school , for example . <p> Once kids reach adolescence , some experience distress over their body nearing or going through pubertal changes -- which can be relieved by puberty blockers that temporarily put a pause on these developments . <p> One thing that helped Howland feel more comfortable with her daughter starting puberty blockers at age 12 was realizing that withholding them would not be a neutral decision , since puberty is permanent -- which could have negative consequences for a child who does n't identify with that body . <h> Dealing with friends and family <p> The response from Howland 's family and friends was one of support , she said . But Rhynard , a descendant of " some of the very first Mormons , " did n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our extended family , some more than others , " Rhynard said . " Some of the family members have been accommodating , and they have tried their best to use different pronouns , but they still get it wrong a couple years later . " <p> Rhynard and her husband have had to have some really difficult conversations in which " we 've said , ' Our child comes first , and we would love for you to be a part of our lives , but you ca n't call them by their dead name . It is too painful for them , ' " she added . <p> Their parenting philosophy is based on humility , learning and growing , but they realized they ca n't make everyone learn and grow with them . While some family relationships have become strained , Rhynard knows her responsibility is to her children . <p> " If we centered them in the conversation about our child , we would no longer be centering our child , the most vulnerable person in our family and the person that we 're lucky enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggling with complicated family relationships , Goepferd recommends finding support from another parent of a transgender child , a trustworthy friend or an understanding church leader . Organizations such as the Human Rights Campaign and PFLAG have resources for how to talk about your child 's identity with loved ones and their school . <p> " We , as a society , put a lot of pressure on appearance and how other people perceive us , " Bright-Williams said . But parents have the burden of shouldering that pressure so their kids do n't have to . <p> Parents have to make these sorts of decisions all the time , she added . <p> " Maybe your child is biracial and some people in your family have a problem with that , " she said . " Would you want them to experience that type of bias or hate , or would you protect or shelter them from that ? It is up to you to create a safe and affirming space for your child . " <h> ' A political lightning rod ' <p> These parents have said their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led to strengthened , more trustful relationships with them . Howland , Rhynard and Cornwell all said they have also changed -- they 're more accepting , open-minded and confident in protecting their families . <p> " She 's great , " Howland said of her daughter , but " we keep waiting for the world to rear its ugly head on her . She is aware that trans people are a political lightning rod . Sometimes she says things that break my heart , like ' There are people who hate me , ' or ' There are people who wish I did n't exist . ' " <p> Howland and her husband know they ca n't shield their daughter from every news story or potential bully . " Desperately afraid about my child not having federal civil rights protections in this country , " Howland said she even has a spreadsheet of what countries they could move to if they had to one day . <p> To make her daughter aware and prepared , she has exposed her to the issues in as positive of a context as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a recent fundraiser for Sarah McBride , a Delaware-based trans woman who is the nation 's first known transgender person to serve as a state senator and who is now running for Congress . <p> " I say to her that it 's my job to carry that right now , not hers , " Howland said . " And that she 's safe and that we will always do everything we can to protect her . "

Photo credit : Marcos del Mazo/LightRocket/Getty Images <p> An unusual horned comet notable for a series of outbursts , nicknamed the " devil comet , " will make its closest approach of Earth on Sunday around 3am ET ( 7pm Sunday NZT ) . <p> While the comet has n't been visible to those in the Northern Hemisphere since the first week of May , sky-gazers in the Southern Hemisphere have a better chance of glimpsing the fuzzy object through binoculars or a telescope . <p> Exactly why the dynamic comet takes on a shape that has drawn comparisons to the Millennium Falcon spacecraft from the " Star Wars " films when explosively active is still an enigma to scientists . But the celestial object only completes one orbit around the sun about every 71 years , similar to Halley 's comet , which make the odds of observing it for close study a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity . <p> Given that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , collective observations by astronomers could provide key insights into its true nature and behaviour . <p> Officially known as Comet 12P/Pons-Brooks , the celestial object made its closest pass of the sun on April 21 , coming within 74.4 million miles ( 119.7 million kilometres ) of our star . <p> The comet will make its closest pass of Earth on Sunday , but it will be more than 143 million miles ( 230 million kilometres ) away from our planet and wo n't pose a risk . For reference , the sun is 93 million miles ( 149 million kilometres ) away from Earth . <p> The Virtual Telescope Project captured a view of the comet over Manciano , in Italy 's Tuscany region , under the darkest sky of the peninsula . Photo credit : Gianluca Masi/Virtual Telescope Project <p> The comet peaked in brightness in late April and has been steadily fading for three to four weeks , said Dr. Dave Schleicher , astronomer at Lowell Observatory in Arizona . <p> " For folks down below the equator , the coming weeks and months might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1950s , " said astronomer Dr. Teddy Kareta , a postdoctoral associate at Lowell . <p> Two prolific discoverers , Jean-Louis Pons and William Robert Brooks , independently observed the devil comet - Pons in 1812 and Brooks in 1883 . But the comet has likely made many trips around the sun over thousands of years , long before astronomers thought of comets as anything other than " something weird in the atmosphere , " Schleicher said . <h> More from Newshub <p> Astronomers estimate the massive comet to be between 6.2 to 12.4 miles ( 10 to 20 kilometres ) in diameter , Kareta said . <p> The rare visitor has a green appearance typical of most comets because they contain diatomic carbon molecules that absorb sunlight and emit a color that appears green from our perspective , Schleicher said . <h> A series of cosmic outbursts <p> Pons-Brooks recently captured the attention of astronomers after exhibiting intriguing behaviour that caused the comet to have a horned appearance and soar through our solar system . <p> The comet has experienced a number of outbursts during the past eight months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such releases are not uncommon in comets and a crescent or Pac-Man shape has been observed in other ones , it 's difficult to tell what is normal for Pons-Brooks . <p> " I would say it 's somewhat unusual in the number of outbursts it 's been having , " Schleicher said . " On the other hand , it 's not like you have good records from the past to really let you know what is typical . And I suspect given the fairly large number of outbursts that have happened over the last eight months , that this is very clearly a usual occurrence for Pons-Brooks . " <p> Comets are chunks of dust , rock and ice , essentially frozen remnants from the formation of the solar system . They also contain frozen elements such as carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide . <p> Comets heat up and brighten as they approach the sun , and some of the frozen gases stored in comets do n't need to warm up much before they begin to turn into vapor , Schleicher said . <p> The expanding bright blob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred a day before the Lowell Discovery Telescope in Arizona captured this October 2023 image . Photo credit : Theodore Kareta/Lowell Observatory <p> " We think the ultimate driver , of course , is heating from the sun , " he said . " The comet is coming in ; it 's been sitting out in a deep freeze for years . The heat is going to be working its way from the surface down to wherever that carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide ice is located . " <p> Astronomers suspect Pons-Brooks outbursts have occurred over the course of repeated events as heat vaporizes material inside the comet , which causes pressure to build up and break through the surface . While an explosion of gas would n't be visible in telescopes , the dust it kicks up would create the kind of events observed from Pons-Brooks , Schleicher said . <p> Scientists have traced the jets of material observed releasing from the comet during its outburst to two source regions on its surface . Astronomers are puzzled as to why " the whole surface is n't going off like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ice has crusted over the majority of the surface , or the ice has been vaporized away , leaving only dirt behind , but astronomers are " not quite sure which of those mechanisms runs the show " , he said . <p> The comet 's outbursts seem to have ceased , however , and it has n't shown any outburst activity since February , Kareta said . <h> What we can learn from comets <p> Astronomers have been observing Pons-Brooks in the hopes of uncovering more details about its rotation rate , or the rate at which comets spin as they move through space . Pons-Brooks has a rotation period of 57 hours , which is longer than expected , and astronomers want to know if the jets of material releasing from the comet are speeding it up or slowing it down . <p> An overlapping series of events likely has contributed to Pons-Brooks ' distinctive look , but it could also be due to our perspective of the comet , Kareta said . <p> " These are three-dimensional objects , " Kareta said . " When we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in a limited range of colors all flattened down in two dimensions . This will make things that might make perfect sense to you , if you 're able to go up and walk around and see it in a couple of different perspectives , look much more complicated than they really are .

@@108991237 <p> Watson 's case is back before the Court of Appeal in Wellington this week , where he 's seeking to overturn his convictions for the murders in the Marlborough Sounds on New Year 's Day in 1998 . <p> Ben Smart , 21 , and Hope , 17 , have n't been seen since getting out of a water taxi on to a yacht moored in Endeavour Inlet . There 's been no trace of the pair since the early hours of New Year 's Day , 1998 . Their bodies and possessions have never been found . <p> Watson was convicted of double murder in September 1999 and sentenced to life imprisonment , with a minimum period of 17 years in jail . He has now spent 26 years behind bars , protesting his innocence . <p> The blanket was first examined in 1998 and no hairs were found . In March of that year , after samples of Hope 's hairs were sent to the ESR laboratory , the blanket strands were tested again . This time two strands of blond hair were found . <p> The latest appeal is the result of a royal prerogative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2020 . The grounds for the appeal are two-fold : <p> The reliability of DNA evidence , specifically hairs that were thought to belong to Hope and were recovered from Watson 's boat , Blade . <p> Mistakes by the police in using a photo montage as a means of identifying Watson . The montage contained a new photo that showed Watson caught halfway through a blink . This gave the appearance of hooded eyes , a characteristic of the mystery man 's description . <p> Today the court heard from the writers of a report commissioned by Watson 's team which assessed the identification of Watson by a water taxi driver , Guy Wallace , who died in 2021 . The report concluded Wallace 's identification testimony had little or no probative value . <p> But Crown lawyer Stuart Baker raised questions about the report , saying it was selective in its evidence and made findings of fact without all the notes of evidence , including the 3000 pages of trial transcript . <p> Ben Smart and Olivia Hope . Photo / Supplied <p> Baker started today 's proceedings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and expert in witness memory research . Wells and his colleague Dr Adele Quigley-McBride prepared the report . <p> Wells appeared at the hearing by video link , with much of his evidence centring on the reliability of witness accounts from that night . <p> Baker suggested to Wells that he had made factual findings without sufficient notes of evidence . <p> Wells told the court he had read all the evidence provided to him , focusing on the statements and identification of the witnesses who were on the water taxi that night with Smart and Hope when they dropped them at the boat with the man . <p> Much of the time was spent on Wallace 's evidence . He originally gave the police a composite of the man on the water taxi that night . <p> The composite picture showed a man with long , straggly hair . <p> That differed from the photograph of Watson which Wallace was shown in January , which was black and white and taken in 1990 - eight years before the murders . Wallace rejected the photo , telling the police , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Wells said . <p> Then in April , three months later , he was shown a montage and after " wavering " between two photos , he picked Watson from the montage . <p> " We think that montage was biased ... Wallace had seen the image multiple times , he was shown the image by the media , " Wells said . <p> The doctor said he thought Wallace 's memory of the man was best captured by the composite picture he gave the police and it changed over time . " But memory does n't get better with time , so we believe memory contamination is the best explanation . <p> " He confidently rejected a single photo of Watson while his memory was fresh , " he said . <p> " All he was doing when making that identification that he did n't actually recognise him from that night . That he 's trusting that law enforcement and investigators are leading him down the right path and then he began questioning that but then he ends up coming around at the time of the trial . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been selective about the evidence , including that of water taxi passenger Hayden Morrissey , who did n't pick Watson from a montage he was shown . <p> Wells said Morrissey had described the man in the water taxi with him as having long , scraggly hair . He also suggested he was a more reliable witness because , unlike Wallace , he had n't been shown a photograph of Watson . <p> But Baker suggested a reason Morrissey did n't pick Watson out from the montage was that he saw the man only from behind and therefore was unable to pick him from a photo . Yet Wells had failed to include this in his report . <p> Hope 's sister Amelia 's description of Watson was also challenged by Wells , who said she did n't mention Watson 's short hair and receding hairline until after Watson 's image was plastered all over the media . <p> " Once you see the person plastered across TV or are shown a picture by law enforcement if you are adding to your description , it 's post-event information - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other sources , " he said . <p> But Wells did agree people can describe the same person in different ways . <p> " We do n't say that we believe Watson to be innocent , we 're just saying that eyewitness evidence does not have positive propensity value on that point , " he said . <p> This afternoon Quigley-McBride defended the use of Morrissey 's evidence , saying it was a different process to identify someone from a line-up than to describe them to someone . <p> She denied the report was misleading because it omitted that Morrissey had only seen the man from behind . And she said both Wallace and Morrissey had given similar descriptions of the man on the boat that night , which differed from photos of Watson . <p> Baker suggested the report 's findings about Wallace 's identification of Watson was merely speculation . <p> " Only if you think science is speculation , " she responded . <p> Watson is not attending the Court of Appeal hearing but is represented by his lawyers , Nick Chisnall , KC , and Kerry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Baker . <p> Watson 's case before Justices Christine French , Patricia Courtney and Susan Thomas is set down for a week . <p> Catherine Hutton is an Open Justice reporter , based in Wellington .

At the time of the massacre , I was visiting the middle governorate and heard Israeli bombing everywhere . F-16 fighter jets , Apache helicopters , artillery and warships were all involved in the random bombing of civilian gatherings .

The friendly governments of this colonial state , primarily the US administration , adopt rhetoric that legitimises the genocidal crimes committed by this colonial state . Since the beginning of this genocidal war , western officials have called for the release of Israeli hostages , implying that the only problem in Gaza is the hostages ' detention . <p> Humanitarians have denounced reports that the Israeli military used an aid truck as a disguisefor its brutal attack on the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza , which saw hundreds of Palestinians killed during an operation to rescue captives held by Hamas.The Palestine Red Crescent Society ( PRCS ) , one of the main medical organisations in Gaza , decried what it said was the Israeli military 's covert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which it said puts the lives of aid workers in danger .

Authorities in the Gaza Strip on Sunday said at least 698 others were injured in " an unprecedented brutal attack " , some in critical condition , as hospitals struggle to cope with the flow of wounded or dead bodies . Reporting from inside Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in central Gaza 's Deir el-Balah , Al Jazeera 's Hind Khoudary on Sunday said civil defence crews are still finding dead or wounded Palestinians from under the rubble in the aftermath of the Nuseirat attack , as more air strikes target areas across the enclave .

The official said drones operated by the UK and US have gathered information that Israeli drones have n't been able to , mostly because of the huge numbers of US drones flying over Gaza.British and American drones and officials are " part of the largest intelligence effort ever conducted in Israel , and probably ever " , Avi Kalo , an Israeli reserve officer who once headed a military intelligence department told The New York Times .

" As I drove away , out of that creepy , cursed suburb/cemetery , I knew people would have seen me at this place and I prayed he would n't die in the next 24 hours as I would surely be blamed for causing it -- something distressing I would have presumed to have said to him . I did n't want to touch him either -- we were far apart enough not to have a handshake . Death has an irrational infectious quality . Even old age seemed to me a transmissible malady in that moment . Reeking of death is not too strong a description . <p> The third event was seeing a stroke happen in real time . In the middle of a hui someone had asked if this woman was OK and when we looked one side of her face had slumped and she had become paralysed . We got her to the hospital quickly and she has since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one side . ( But it 's not all bad news for her lifestyle as she 's still smoking ) . The terror of that moment , when someone is in a health emergency which we are helpless to stop , is a sobering experience . It 's all happening internally -- a tragic self-harm episode of the aging body . We witnessed that fragility of body and life and down deep we wonder if that will be our fate , or worse -- and who knows when . Were they unlucky they had a stroke , or were they lucky they survived a stroke ? We were fortunate she survived her misfortune is perhaps a better take . <p> Those three life experiences bear on my analysis of Biden 's performance in that debate -- they ended up the reference points for making sense of what I had seen . <p> - Sponsor Promotion - <p> Biden was so pale he was doing white face . When he did his granddad shuffle onto the stage , with his long , whispy hair dragged across his head like The Simpson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stage and smiled his crooked smile we knew we had the un-jacked Biden . No State of the Nation Jill Juice from Dr Biden tonight . He was n't bringing an A game , it turned out an E game -- E for empty . Is this dead cat going to bounce ? Cadaverous would be accurate as for appearance , shambolic as for performance and calamitous as the outcome . A worse showing would not have been possible -- and to think another debate is scheduled for September ! <p> For once a debate that was n't about Trump . His usual swag of hyperbole and half-truths in a format where he was more or less forced to be presidential merely magnified Biden 's octogenarian gaffes as the merciless split screen CNN reverted to as the default cut proved brutally telling . That lifeless white skin took me back to that desiccated feline under the house . The slumped left side of Biden 's face during some parts were disturbing . When he began slurring and when the whole side -- mouth , cheeks , eyes -- have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happening . When his breath seemed to barely carry the words , so faintly and quietly rasped my thought went back to " I 'm dying . " That distant , frozen gaze , that mouth hanging agape , it was a difficult watch . I have seen it before and it is death . A performance so bad it really could be set to Mahler 's masterpiece of ebbing life . His sentences trailing off were a muffled , muted epilogue to a once was firebrand . Biden is so old that the earliest news clip of him on YouTube ( after he entered congress ) is in black and white . His first bid for the presidency was forty years ago . He is an old timer and an old time server . We were watching a relic . <p> With his stumbling , stuttering and slurring you would assume Trump made mince meat out of old Joe and hammered him on it at every turn . Au contraire . Trump was at pains to keep this knacker 's yard donkey in the game by pulling punches in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insisting Biden polls best against him . Quite something to watch -- Trump is obviously terrified Biden will drop out . At this point Trump has offered more public support to Biden than the Democrats have . And what Dems have offered is pathetic and desperate reasoning , forced as they are to recognise the appalling debate loss : pity vote Biden . But pity votes are losing votes -- the electorate will not vote out of pity that is not how competitive politics works . <p> I have followed the betting markets and the odds quite closely . They do n't usually get things wrong . For a long time it was running about $1.90 Trump , $2.70 Biden . When I checked just after the debate ended it was $1.60 Trump , $3.00 Biden . The hot money in the exchanges ( with no margins ) was $1.70 Trump , $4.50 Biden . Gavin Newsom at this stage was $15 , Michelle Obama $26 , Kamala Harris $40 , RFK Jr $98 , Hillary Clinton $78 , Gretchen Whitmer $147 . Within half an hour of the debate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widened on the fixed odds to $4.50 and on the exchange to $5.60 , Newsom was under $10 , Obama $16 , Harris $27 , Clinton $60 , Whitmer $108 . These are massive movements in a very short space of time . The market had decisively abandoned Biden . After a few more hours it was Whitmer who had made the most ground coming into $40 -- incredible as she was well over $100 . Biden stabilised on the back of reassurances from top Dems that he was locked in . I do n't think Jill Biden 's coaxing of her husband like a toddler at the post-debate would have assisted the market confidence though -- her shrill tone as she screeched to the crowd to call Trump a liar was ear-splitting ( Joe seemed unmoved , he probably ca n't hear in that range anymore to his great relief ) . <p> I ca n't see Biden going on much longer even with the institutional backing of the Dems and the donors after this debate . It would seem impossible . The tepid and apologetic endorsements from Obama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day was also rather sad and miserable and for what energy he may have summoned for that occasion he was still slurring and fumbling. <h> 13 COMMENTS <p> It seems Jill Biden is the main protagonist in all of this , I 'm pretty sure most ( all ? ) women who see their husbands are failing badly as Biden has been for last cpl of years would be **25;464;TOOLONG her husband to step back and retire gracefully , for some reason she would be carrying him in his coffin up onto that debating stage . Methinks ' first lady Biden ' enjoys her status a wee bit too much to give it up so soon . <p> Seems to me that the " basket of deplorable " have it in the bag . But what will change ? The oligarchs will still rule , the deep state will do their bidding . And all the " loyal Left " will run around screaming lamentations about Trump bringing the end of the world . Meanwhile behind the curtains pulling the levers will be the usual suspects , Rothschilds , Morgan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a farce , at least it features two clowns to give it authenticity . <p> Way too old . He should have planed to step down at the end of this term and allowed a younger person to gain some credability .

The whole world would be better for it too <p> OMG .... St Jacinda ! You do realise Gordon her popularity was -1% when she ran for the hills , her ' gas tank empty ' rhetoric had nothing to do with her popularity tanking so much in 2 short years ? ( 72% in 2020 ) But by all means Gordon the veneration you have of her is admirable ..... *snigger* ... <p> Expect to hear soon that as much as he wants to serve his country , he has asked too much of his family already and so he 's going to step aside for their sake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is not physically or mentally capable to be POTUS . <p> He wo n't be on the ballot in November <p> And every political and media hack that has stood there for the last two years parroting " he 's as sharp as a tack " can take responsibility for this debacle <p> It is surely getting near ABB -- Anyone But Biden -- time for Joe to go . The guy is quite likely to die in office qwere he to win . Genocide Joe has been horrific over Palestine and could be discarded for that alone in many peoples view . <p> And ... the systemic problem is the American first past the post electoral system , voter suppression , alienation and non voters , gerrymandering , and bent Electoral College . The Democrats DNC is as linked to US Imperialism and capital as the Republicans are , so it is hard to see anything positive coming out of this election at this stage . <p> There is a reason why you turned away from a dying man , there is a reason why an old cat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Death is obscene .

@@109675232 <h> So Nicola Willis will spend $1.2billion on a Toyota Corolla ? <p> KiwiRail negotiates a sweetheart deal for 2 Rail capable Ferries for $550m at a time when boat builders were desperate for work . <p> It was a sweetheart deal because it gave us an upgrade to Rail that would be crucial to lower our emissions targets and to build capacity into the Cook Strait for more economic growth . <p> The cost ' blowout ' was the necessary and predictable upgrade to the Ports . Labour should get a kick in the arse over how this managed to be a surprise to everyone , but the cost to upgrade the Ports was always going to be a necessity . <p> National get in and immediately kill the deal by rat-fucking KiwiRail so their Trucking Industry Interests are protected . <p> - Sponsor Promotion - <p> Nicola Willis wanted the virtue signal of killing the deal off without seeming to bother working out what to do next .

Unless you are referring to Nicola 's political leanings , these are not words you would ever use referring to her . <p> yep and we will still need to future proof the ports at either end . We will end up spending 5 billion not forgetting the 430 mill already spent then the beak fee on top of that . We are nearly 1 billion on the way already . What a stupid woman <p> What a dope clearly labour ordered the best posable ships to allow future growth now we are headed to 6 million people soon . The problem arose with the price gouging of the national party owned construction companies doing the required up grades . The existing ports are as old as biden . As far as the size of the ferries I would rather a Toyota Crown if i had to travel with Willis as she and I would be hard pressed to fit in the corolla . <p> They had 2 new ferries coming &amp; it was probably only National voting types causing any planning delays &amp; cost overruns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war &amp; a major pandemic to deal with while keeping the economy running so it 's not as if they were doing nothing . <p> Because Labour has an emotional attachment , almost a codependency , for the Rail sector . Labour ca n't say ' no ' to the rail sector . <p> Rail and the ferries has big militant unions -- Railway workers and engineering workshops are heavily organised , and the Maritime Union is one of the last ones that seriously disrupt the economic activity of NZ . <p> Another factor is that rail , unlke trucking , needs a central controling management to ensure it works safely and efficiently -- that gives the state a huge &amp; essential role . Trucking is self-organising and the Govenment has little role to play apart from road and vehicle standards . Also , truck drivers are widely exploited by the freight companies , who are ruthless -- but then their customers in the wider corporate world are ruthless in cutting freight costs . <p> When was the last strike Ada ? ? . It 's a pity there have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the last two incidents of breakdown on the water also included the staff on board . I think you are living in the past glories of the union movement not even this rat shit right wing government can seriously blame the unions for this crock of shit that is this government . There is a hatred for rail from this the national party and the act party , Richard Prebble 's campaign to save the rail is a good example while campaigning with the railway workers he was actually planning to sell it off ( that 's the rabid right wing for you ) . One also wonders about the rail bosses who do nothing to help their cause with the public it 's as if they have a death wish themselves . This will definitely not be Willis 's finest hour , " the lady 's not for turning " but maybe in the end for selling . Its not going to end well . <p> Utterly incomprehensible stupidity . Mind you , this is a party that lies to cancer sufferers for their votes , so go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tinfoil Winston , on all this ? Yet another betrayal by NZ1st . <p> What I do n't understand is why there is any long winded discussion about cancelling the ships . At 2 For $500m they 're a bargain , and if the cancel cost is half the contract price then no-one in their right mind should be cancelling them when they 're a saleable asset at the end fo the build . I see they have three options . 1 . Cancel the contract and pay the astronomical break fee = dumb 2 . Alter the design to take 10% off the size ( complex ) so they can fit in the existing ports and safe navigation plans . 3 . Build them anyway and if they can be made to fit in the interim , great , otherwise sell/lease them to Stena ferries to take Polish truck drivers across the Baltic . <p> Should n't the question be why have n't any governments invested in infrastructure apart from just new highways . <p> Labour and National led governments are to blame here and imposing austerity on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country is so run down and barely functions and the money wasted on some of these ridiculous ideas instead of putting the money into vital transport links like the Cook straight ferries and ports . <p> We lurch from one ideological position to another every time the government changes so how can anyone plan with certainty on anything getting done and it being seen through . <p> National want economic growth but do n't want pay for new ferries and would rather see it all privatized for their wealthy supporters which has been a complete disaster if the past is anything to go by .

Photo / File <p> Coroner Dunn said it was also apparent during the inquest that terms used by medical staff involved in Leith 's case led CYFS staff to become " tunnel-visioned in their response to Leith 's care " . <p> " Undue reliance was placed on the medical opinion given by Dr Garrett that the explanation given for the femur injury was plausible , " she said " <p> " That reliance led to a flawed process and an inadequate response by CYFS to ensure that Leith was kept safe and protected from those responsible for caring for him . <p> " I consider that Leith 's inquest has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to properly address suspected child abuse and to intervene in an appropriate and timely manner .

@@109933234 <h> Asides <h> Get Woman 's Day home delivered ! <p> If Brett knew he was dying , he certainly did n't let on to his family and friends . The devoted father of Napier 's one-year-old quadruplets , Jonathan , Oliver , Lucy and Esther , as well as three-year-old Peter , passed away at Hawke 's Bay Hospital a few weeks ago , with his wife Joanne Wills , his parents and his siblings at his side . <p> Just 42 when he died , Brett was a stay-at-home dad who loved God , trout fishing and his family . He had also had a congenital heart defect from birth . <p> Joanne speaks to Woman 's Day from the couple 's Napier home a week after Brett 's funeral . She says that although she was aware of her husband 's condition , she always imagined there would be more time . <p> " We had hoped for another 20 years -- for him to be at the quads ' second birthday and Peter 's fifth birthday , and to see them through school , " tells the IT consultant , 37 . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was slowing down a lot . ' <p> Brett with his fantastic five . <p> " I look around our home and it 's immaculate -- he 'd developed it to be as low maintenance as possible . I wonder if that was for me and if Brett knew deep down that he did n't have much longer to live . " <p> Joanne is telling her story to honour the man who was first a flatmate , then a partner , and finally a dedicated husband and father . His diagnosis had come as a teenager , Joanne says . It was devastating news for an otherwise-active Wairoa boy keen on duck shooting and getting outdoors . <p> At 18 , Brett was given just six months to live . Then following further investigations to clarify the nature of his heart defect , his life expectancy jumped to 10 years . As he progressed , doctors continued to extend his timeline . However , there was always the knowledge that although Brett had a largely normal and healthy life , his heart was compromised . <p> So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , skydiving or trips to Disneyland , he had just three simple things in mind -- a Subaru WRX ( " a boy-racer car " , laughs Joanne ) , a wife and some children to dote on . <p> Joanne is determined to keep working because she wants her children to see their mum achieve things . <p> And Brett certainly got more than he might ever have dreamed of in the family department . One of eight children himself , Brett moved from Wairoa to Hastings as a young man and into a flat with a group of other Christians . <p> One of his three flatmates was Joanne and the pair got to know each other as friends , discovering many shared values . <p> But when Brett got a job back in Wairoa -- almost two hours ' drive away -- Joanne began to question why he did n't move out . " He kept turning up at the weekend , " she says with a wide smile , remembering those romantic early days . " It took a while to figure out that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Brett , it was n't appropriate to live together if they were to become a couple , so Brett left the flat and the pair began to date . <p> " I loved how laidback and easy-going Brett was , " recalls Joanne . " He was very funny and gentle , and he loved games -- he 'd have the whole flat playing board game Ticket to Ride . But he also knew how to challenge me . I could tell early on that he 'd make an excellent father . " <p> Brett proposed by the stunning Maraetotara Falls , not far from Hastings . " It was a perfect spring day , and we were surrounded by all these flowers , butterflies and bees ! " says Joanne , clearly delighted at the memory . The pair wed just six months later . <p> " Brett loved vehicles -- of all types . He had his truck licence and could drive anything , so the only thing he had to organise for our wedding day was the vehicle we would leave the venue in . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's illness never held him back from the things he wanted to achieve in life , tells Joanne . He finally bought that Subaru at age 25 , as well as marrying the girl of his dreams and having five beautiful children -- four of them at once ! <p> And he was always positive about the hand he 'd been dealt . " He worked right up until Peter was born , driving loaders for a fertiliser company . When he was n't there , we loved to get outside and go for walks . It was n't always easy because his condition limited his physical abilities . We could do it with the help of a portable oxygen machine so long as we just took our time . <p> " You know , some people complain that their partner just sits on the couch and does n't do anything . Brett had every reason to plant himself on the sofa and do nothing -- every excuse under the sun . But he was constantly down on the floor changing nappies or rough-and-tumbling with the children . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifting and carrying , he was very active as a stay-at-home dad . He spent hours playing with them and taking them to all the local activities . They particularly loved the playgroup and church music programme Kanikani Kids . If Peter needed some one-on-one time , they 'd go off and find a digger somewhere . " <p> Yes , little Peter has inherited his dad 's obsession with vehicles , preferably the type that moves , lifts or carries dirt . After Brett 's funeral , where 300 friends and family members gathered to pay their respects and honour his unerring faith , the loving father was buried at Western Hills Cemetery , on the slopes overlooking Napier . <p> " There were some shovels available so Brett 's siblings could help cover the casket in earth . Someone had put a little spade out for Peter , so he joined in , " says Joanne . " Afterwards it was the only thing he wanted to talk about : ' Daddy went in a hole in the ground and I got to throw flowers on him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water his dad because he knows that when things go into the garden , that 's what you do . " <p> But there have been deeply sad moments in the weeks since Brett 's passing too . " Esther was a real daddy 's girl and is missing him terribly , " says Joanne . " She will bring me his socks or his shoe , then point to his picture and say , ' Daddy ! Daddy ! ' She 's too little to communicate properly , but it 's clear she wants her father . " <p> For Joanne , the future is now unknown . She 's certain of one thing -- and that is Brett is no longer in pain . <p> " He is with Jesus now , " she says -- and that 's an enormous comfort . She has a beautiful recent memory of their last weekend away , just the two of them together , in Gisborne . " Although the weather was shocking and it bucketed down , it was a nice excuse to stay in and watch Netflix ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family , work colleagues and her nanny Lucy , although the expense of live-in help is a burden . That 's why the local branch of the Multiples Association has set up a Givealittle page to help the Wills family get through . <p> " I did consider leaving my job to become a full-time mum , " says Joanne . She adds , " but I do n't think I would like being on a benefit when I enjoy working so much . I want my children to grow up knowing what a strong work ethic looks like . I want them to see Mum get out and do things . " <p> So every cent donated will fund additional hours of care , she says , while her salary continues to pay for five sets of everything , " as well as all the food " . She adds , " It wo n't be long before they 're eating me out of house and home ! " <p> Joanne knows the waters ahead will not be smooth , but she is so grateful for the eight wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his five adorable children . <p> " I hope they remember him as that dad who was always there for them and with them , " she smiles sadly . " He gave everything for them . I want them to remember how much he loved them and to understand how proud he would be of them . "

Melanie and Leah 's amazing big day <h> Asides <h> Get NZ Woman 's Weekly home delivered ! <p> When Melanie Arthur and Leah Kerr first met 10 years ago , they could never have dreamed of the moment they would face each other at the altar , vowing to love each other forever , while their seven-month-old sons looked on from the front row of the chapel . <p> Back then , they were both married to men and busy raising two kids each . Their daughters joined the same theatre class and became best friends . The mums then developed a close friendship of their own . By 2021 , it had evolved into a surprise romance , which would lead them to this unforgettable wedding ceremony . <p> The Weekly first met Melanie , 41 , and Leah , 37 , in September 2023 , when they were both pregnant with each other 's babies . Using the same sperm donor , they had conceived through IVF , with Melanie carrying Leah 's egg and vice versa , and were due to give birth six days apart . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it turned out , the boys were born 12 days apart . Alfie Alan Arthur-Kerr arrived on November 1 and Charlie Elias Arthur-Kerr on November 12 . On June 7 this year , the brothers -- looking dapper in tiny suits and suspenders -- were the guests of honour at their mums ' " fancy boho " wedding at Queenstown 's Stoneridge Estate . <p> Although Melanie and Leah live in Nelson ( both worked as secretaries at Nelson Hospital before going on maternity leave ) , they chose the destination wedding because they have beautiful memories of a trip to the picturesque South Island town they took three years ago , before they became an official couple . <p> Their four teenage children from their first marriages -- a boy and girl each -- played a special role in the wedding ceremony . They arrived in style in a Bentley and walked up the aisle first , ahead of the brides . <p> " Then we walked up the aisle together , holding hands , " Leah says . <p> Both wore champagne-coloured gowns : Melanie 's from Elodie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Motueka . While they 'd tried dresses on together , they did n't know which the other had chosen until just before the ceremony , with only their kids present . " I got to the chapel slightly before Leah and stood with my back to the car . Then when Leah arrived , I turned around , " Melanie says . " Leah was stunning . I was like , ' Oh my gosh ! ' Absolutely stunning . " <p> " So were you ! " exclaims Leah . <p> There 's a romantic story attached to Melanie 's outfit . She had desperately wanted to wear a glamorous cape for the winter wedding , but when her dress ended up costing more than Leah 's , she gave up on the idea , wanting to keep costs down . <p> So , Leah hatched a plan . She ordered the cape , pretending it was for herself . When it arrived , she tried it on , and Melanie , of course , loved it . " Then I put it on her and said , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " It was so sweet ! " Melanie gushes . <p> It 's obvious that kindness and deep care are the cornerstones of their relationship , but it has n't always been easy . Taking the plunge and choosing to be together was a massive upheaval for both their families and has taken some time to adjust . But they weathered that storm together and , likewise , supported each other through their simultaneous pregnancies and the joyful but exhausting early months with Alfie and Charlie , who both suffered from colic as newborns . <p> Wedding celebrant Andrew Bell , " a beautiful person with a beautiful heart " , spoke movingly about their early challenges during the ceremony . <p> " He managed to reference that we 've been through some ups and downs , and had some tough decision-making .

" She told her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , but I can promise you my world . You and our children are now my priority . " <p> Another personal touch came from their bouquets . They had carefully selected artificial flowers online and combined them to fit the colour scheme , dusky pink and blue , with accents of cream and navy blue . " It takes a bit of research , but it saves a lot of money , and they wo n't die , so we can keep them forever , " Leah says . <p> After the ceremony , a helicopter whisked Melanie and Leah off for some alpine wedding photos . <p> They paid tribute to their shared Scottish heritage with a handfasting ceremony , using tartans from their clans , Kerr , Robertson and Arthur . Leah 's mum , Sandra Hughes , and Melanie 's mum , Kim Robertson , and stepmum , Cheryl Arthur , each tied a ribbon around the brides ' hands , creating a Celtic knot to symbolise their new bond -- literally tying the knot .

They enjoyed a three-course meal and a showstopping cupcake-stand cake . The DJ , from Mountain Beats DJ Co , kept people on the floor all night , including a first dance for the brides to Only Us from the musical Dear Evan Hansen . The lyrics could n't have been more fitting : " What if it 's you / And what if it 's me / And what if that 's all that we need it to be / And the rest of the world falls away ? / What do you say ? " <p> The bouquet featured artificial flowers so they can be kept forever . <p> Melanie and Leah were particularly touched that the DJ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The stage version features both a male and female voice . <p> It was an intimate wedding party of just 30 people , including the brides .

A friend had volunteered to be nanny for the evening . <p> The couple took advantage of the fact that all their parents were gathered in one place , including Leah 's mum , who 'd come over from Australia . They arranged to have their sons christened at St Peter 's Anglican Church in Queenstown the day after the wedding . <p> The day after the wedding , the newlyweds celebrated the double christening of their sons with their family and Reverend Dr Michael Godfrey . <p> Faith is a meaningful part of their lives , especially for Melanie , who used to run the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that their boys be christened by someone who completely accepted their relationship .

@@109933237 <h> Asides <h> Get Woman 's Day home delivered ! <p> When Samantha Hayes returned to work after her summer break in January , the mum-of-two hoped that 2024 would be a year of happiness and healing . After separating from her fianc ? six months earlier , Sam was optimistic that a fresh start meant life was looking brighter for her and her children , Marlow , four , and Amaya , two . <p> However , nothing could have prepared the beloved broadcaster for the shock announcement that Newshub would be shutting up shop , bringing down the curtain on her stellar two decades at Three . Not only had Sam 's home life been turned on its head , now her work life was in turmoil too . <p> " It felt unfathomable , " she tells Woman 's Day over a pot of English breakfast tea at a caf ? near the Newshub studios in central Auckland . " When I started this year , I thought , ' This is really going to be it . This is the year that things get back on track ! ' And then it all crashed down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blue and totally heartbreaking . " <p> But now , as she enters her final week presenting the flagship 6pm news bulletin alongside her longtime friend and colleague Mike McRoberts , Sam is feeling reflective . If the upheaval of the past year has shown her anything , it 's that she is more resilient than she ever could have imagined . A family separation and job loss in the space of 12 months was a challenge she never saw coming . But , now she 's proud of getting through it in one piece . <p> " I have learnt that I 'm stronger than I realised , " says Sam . She has been announced as the solo host of Stuff 's new 6pm show ThreeNews . " It 's been a rough few months and my tendency is to keep busy and block out the difficult emotions . That way I do n't have to confront the hard stuff . But it 's important to let yourself feel it -- to move through it . Three has given me so much . I 'm so grateful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process the enormity of this loss . " <p> The newsreader , who grew up in Milton , Otago , filed her first story for Three at the tender age of 17 , during a month of work experience . Several years and a journalism degree later , Sam returned first as a reporter . Then at age 23 , she landed the Nightline presenting job . <p> From there , she held many different roles over the years , including a stint across the ditch as Three 's Australian correspondent , before joining Mike on the six o'clock news eight years ago . <p> The future is bright for the determined news presenter . <p> Sam adores her work and describes her colleagues as family . She says that while she and her workmates understood the difficulties facing the industry , none of them believed Warner Bros . Discovery , the company that owns Three , would shutter the entire news operation . <p> " It 's not like we had our heads in the sand , " she insists . " We were aware of the issues with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of us did not think that such a huge step would be taken so rapidly . I remember Mike said he thought that they would amputate a few more limbs before they decided not to resuscitate . " <p> She says the loss of Newshub has felt like a grieving process . " It 's been a roller coaster . There 's the shock , then the despair and the anger , then the disbelief . I went through the whole range of emotions before accepting it and it 's not linear . Some days are easier than others . I 've found it 's very similar to going through a separation in terms of that journey of grief . " <p> For newly single Sam , facing the financial stress of a redundancy was particularly frightening given the fact that she no longer had a partner for back-up . <p> " Losing a job is something so many people are going through at the moment and it really is horrible and scary . It 's like the ground moves and you ca n't stand up properly . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do . But at the same time , it did give me the opportunity to really sit back and think , ' What do I want from life ? ' <p> " Ultimately , I just kept coming back to the fact that I love doing the news and I love live television . I love being able to show people what 's happening . The collaboration involved and the teamwork is beautiful too . I just could n't get my head around not being live each night and for all New Zealand 's major events and breaking news . " <p> Meanwhile , slap-bang in the middle of this turmoil , Sam turned 40 . But given what was going on at work , she did n't feel like a big party . Instead , she opted for a quiet get-together with friends and precious time spent with Marlow and Amaya . <p> " It really did n't feel like a time of celebration , but that did n't stop the kids , " says Sam . " They were adorable because they were just so excited . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped them get and opened them all for me days before my birthday ! They could n't wait . It was so sweet . " <p> And while some women dread their forties , Sam tells us she 's the opposite . She feels positive and excited about stepping into the next decade . <p> " Sure , I 'm getting older -- we all are -- but I 'm comfortable with that . There 's a confidence that comes with life experience , and a surety and a decisiveness . So through all of the ups and downs of the past four months , I 've felt like I trust myself . I 've been able to really reflect on what 's important . " <p> Sam is also fitter and healthier than she 's been in a long time after taking up running again . She hits the pavement and the local trails near her city-fringe home at least three times a week , not to mention having regular scooter outings with the kids . <p> " Running is great because you just put on some shoes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little window of time , I can squeeze it in and I just feel so good afterwards . It 's that endorphin rush that 's incredibly satisfying . " <p> Sam knows there are likely to be tears when she utters her final sign-off on her last Newshub bulletin on Friday night . Saying goodbye to Mike will be painful . She credits the legendary journalist , who is moving to the National Business Review , with helping her become the newsreader she is today . " He 's been so gracious and giving , and we have a beautiful friendship , which I know will continue . " <p> Sam 's grateful for the friendship of her Newshub co-anchor Mike . <p> While it will be " extremely odd " not having Mike next to her in the new job , Sam notes with a smile that given newsreaders appear to be a species on the verge of extinction , she 's incredibly grateful to have landed the role as senior correspondent and presenter at Stuff . The move is tinged with sadness for the end of Newshub , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience and she ca n't wait to get underway . She hopes Newshub viewers will tune in and give the new show a chance . <p> " We will continue doing the gutsy , brilliant journalism that Newshub is known for . We 'll also have the weight of hundreds of excellent Stuff journalists dotted around the country behind us too . It 's actually pretty exciting . There 's a real buzz about it . " <p> While life has dealt Sam more than her fair share of challenges in recent times , she says it 's her children who continue to inspire and motivate her to persevere . Amaya is full of confidence and curiosity , while Marlow is funny and thoughtful . <p> Moving with the tides of change , Sam is ready for her new news journey . <p> Sam marvels at the thought her sweet son will start school later this year .

@@109933239 <h> Asides <h> Get The Australian Woman 's Weekly NZ home delivered ! <p> Afew years ago , Melanie Lynskey was told by a psychic that her career was about to hit the big-time . It was in the early days of the pandemic , during a period when Melanie was feeling particularly " hopeless " , as she put it . The film and television industry was on its knees , and Melanie and her husband Jason Ritter were still recovering from a pregnancy loss . Good news was in short supply . <p> But a friend of a friend had put Melanie in touch with Fatima , a New Orleans-based psychic , who came through with a big , bold message : " You 're about to enter into a time in your career that you did n't think was going to happen because it did n't happen when you were 25 . " <p> In typical self-deprecating fashion , the New Plymouth-born actress thought that maybe Fatima was having an off day . But she was very specific , telling Melanie , " You 've already done something and it 's going to come back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pilot episode she had filmed for a show . She had n't heard a single thing about the series in the seven months since . Whether the pilot was good , whether she was good in it or whether it was going to go anywhere . <p> But Fatima was bang on the money . That pilot episode was for a show called Yellowjackets , a twisty , grisly , darkly funny drama series about a group of 40-something women who are still reckoning with surviving a plane crash as teenagers . <p> It became a worldwide hit and saw Melanie become the kind of overnight success that rarely happens to a woman in her forties . Multiple award nominations , one Critics ' Choice win and several high-profile acting jobs later , she has hit the A-list after decades of being Hollywood 's best-kept secret . <p> And now she 's coming full circle as she plays a real-life Kiwi in her latest role , The Tattooist of Auschwitz , almost three decades after she first played a New Zealander . <h> A heavenly creature <p> Growing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children and a painfully shy child . When she first starred in a school play at the age of six , it brought her a new-found confidence and a love of acting that has sustained her through one of the hardest industries to crack . <p> The hobby quickly became a passion -- she joined the local church just to take part in the plays -- and when she was 16 , an open audition for Sir Peter Jackson 's film Heavenly Creatures saw her cast opposite a young Kate Winslet , telling the real-life story of two teenage girls who decide to kill one of their mothers . <p> From the minute they met , Kate and Melanie were inseparable -- a wholesome version of the feverishly intense teenage friendship they were portraying in the movie . At the time , the English actress described her co-star as being like " the left side of my brain " during the filming process . But once they finished the shoot , their careers took very different paths . <p> Almost immediately , Kate was identified as a rising star , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the years after Heavenly Creatures , she would go on to star in Sense &amp; Sensibility and then the blockbuster Titanic . <p> But it was not the case for Melanie , who was still a painfully shy teenager who felt increasingly out of place in the Hollywood machine . It did n't help that Heavenly Creatures was picked up by Miramax , the film company run by infamous producer Harvey Weinstein , whose decades of predatory behaviour saw him jailed and also kicked off the #MeToo movement . <p> While Melanie remained relatively unscathed , Weinstein seemed to dismiss the young actress as lacking star power . " I was a hindrance , " she recalls . " Kate was a marvel . I knew how special she was ... But whenever there was a fancy dinner , I was treated as if I was n't there . That was particularly by Harvey and it was so hurtful . " <p> That coldness gave Melanie the impression that she was always going to be a Hollywood outsider . This was a thought that only grew when the agent offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> With Kate in Heavenly Creatures . <p> She returned to Aotearoa and went back to school . However , after a couple of years , things picked up again . It was an audition opposite legendary actor Daniel Day-Lewis that made Melanie realise an acting career might be possible . Even though she did n't get the role , the fact that she was being seriously considered to star alongside someone so well-known increased her confidence . <p> Slowly but surely , Melanie built up a career she was proud of . <p> " I was so grateful to be working , I did n't need much , " she tells . " Before that I had been living on nothing . I understood that I was building it from the ground up at that point . I felt lucky that the door had been opened again . " <p> Recurring roles in shows like Two and a Half Men , starring Charlie Sheen , helped pay the rent . Along the way , she worked with some of the biggest names in the business , like Matt Damon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reese Witherspoon . <p> A large part of her career has been spent playing characters that The New York Times described as seeming " innocuous on the surface -- breathy , meek , bland -- only to reveal limitless anger and desire just beneath their suburban separates " . <p> As Melanie puts it , " Directors cast me a few times as somebody who is supposed to surprise you . " <p> And the role in Yellowjackets took that to a whole new level -- Melanie plays Shauna , a seemingly stereotypical bored housewife who holds a secret molten centre of murder , affairs , violence and , well , cannibalism . ' <p> Hot on the heels of Yellowjackets , Melanie was cast as a ruthless vigilante in hit series The Last of Us , a role that saw her nominated for an Emmy . It was another kind-faced part that hid a nerves-of-steel core . <p> While Melanie is a far cry from her murderous characters , her trajectory from playing unassuming best-friend roles to unapologetic female leads has mirrored her own coming-of-age story , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more comfortable as the leading lady of her own life . <p> As Rose in Two and a Half Men . <h> Lucky in love <p> As well as being a genuinely beloved actor in a famously cut-throat industry , Melanie also managed to pull off another rare feat -- an amicable divorce in Hollywood . Her first marriage to actor Jimmi Simpson ended after five years , but the pair remain good friends , often singing each other 's praises in interviews and on social media . <p> A year after their marriage ended in 2013 , Melanie met Jason Ritter -- the son of late Three 's Company actor John Ritter -- at work and the pair fell in love , welcoming their daughter Kahikatea in 2018 , before marrying in a simple ceremony two years later . <p> From their red-carpet appearances to interviews , it 's clear Melanie and Parenthood star Jason are besotted with each other . " I got so lucky , " Melanie says of their marriage . Both working actors , it 's a juggling act , with the family either separated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because of the chaos , there was another honorary member of the family who got a special mention in Melanie 's Critics ' Choice Award acceptance speech . It was their nanny Sally , who the actress credited for being " the most important " person in their lives . <p> It was a speech that went viral and spoke to Melanie 's open nature , as well as the reason she is such an adored figure in Hollywood . She 's always ready to give credit where it 's due . A living embodiment of the idea that a rising tide floats all boats , she 's the first to sing the praises of a pal , castmate or crew member . In fact , Melanie 's Instagram page reads like a visual reminder for just how long she 's been in the industry and how many treasured friends she 's made along the way . <p> But it was n't just the nanny mention that saw Melanie 's acceptance speech strike a chord with so many people . She also singled out the show 's creative team who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly as I am , not asking me to change anything or do anything differently ... It means a lot . " <p> With husband Jason . <h> ' Fat best friend ' <p> It acknowledged an unwelcome thread throughout Melanie 's career : the stifling body-image restrictions that dictate how Hollywood actors are supposed to look . <p> Let 's make no bones about it -- Melanie is a beauty . There 's a reason why she 's been able to work for so long in such a fickle business . But the impact that the size-zero culture of the early 2000s had on film stars -- and those watching them -- ca n't be underestimated . For so long , Melanie says , the only roles directors offered her were those of the " fat best friend " . <p> She recalls , " I 'd get another script to be like , ' The fat character just sitting in the corner eating a chocolate bar , while the pretty girls are all at the dance , ' or whatever . I was like , ' No ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this at all . " <p> During this time , Melanie developed a pattern of disordered eating to try to fit into the Hollywood ideal . It was only after she confided in her then-boyfriend and saw how upset he became , telling her how " violent " she was being with herself , that her behaviour started to change . <p> However , even after her ascent to stardom , Melanie still faced criticism over her body . In 2022 , the actress revealed that one of the production team on Yellowjackets was very concerned about her figure and how it would appear in the show 's love scenes . <p> " They were asking me , ' What do you plan to do ? I 'm sure the producers will get you a trainer . They 'd love to help you with this . ' " <p> It became an issue this crew member would n't drop , continues Melanie . " It was disappointing because I 'd said to that person ahead of time , ' Listen , I had a miscarriage . I 've not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pregnant ... I 've gone through four rounds of IVF since I had my miscarriage , so my body is going through it right now and I 'm just trying to give myself some grace . ' " <p> Due to her past eating disorder , Melanie says her first instinct was to " turn on myself " , but instead she went to the producers , who were horrified on her behalf and shut the criticism down . One of the show 's producers actually wrote her a letter , saying , " I wish I 'd seen someone who looked like you on television when I was growing up , especially in a love triangle with two hot men . It might have shifted my future a little bit . " <p> With husband Jason and their daughter Kahikatea . <h> Kiwi homecoming <p> The third series of Yellowjackets is on its way . However , in the break between filming , Melanie has taken on two very different roles -- both playing New Zealanders . <p> One is Pike , which explores one of Aotearoa 's darkest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert Sarkies , whose film Out of the Blue showed the horrific events of the 1990 Aramoana shooting , it 's written by Outrageous Fortune 's Fiona Samuel and sees Melanie starring alongside Robyn Malcolm . <p> Melanie moved her family back to New Zealand for the duration of filming . She plays Anna Osborne , whose husband Milton died in the mine . Anna became an instrumental figure in pushing the government to make changes to stop such disasters happening again . <p> Her second Kiwi role sees the actress bring to life the extraordinary story of Heather Morris , the Te Awamutu-born social worker-turned-writer . Heather 's Holocaust novel , The Tattooist of Auschwitz , became a global bestseller . <p> The novel recounts the incredible true love story of Lale Sokolov and Gita Furman , two Slovakian Jews who found each other while imprisoned in Auschwitz . It has sold more than 16 million copies around the world . But " it somehow had missed me " , Melanie admits . <p> " When producers asked me to do the limited series , I was talking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How have you not read that book ? ' as though I was crazy . But then , of course , I did read it . The story moved me so much . " <p> In a variation from the novel , the TV drama -- now streaming on Neon and screening on SoHo -- includes Heather meeting and interviewing present-day Lale , played by Harvey Keitel , as he shares his story for the first time . It 's a clever piece of scriptwriting that helps both to propel the story forward and give relief from the stark scenes set in the concentration camp . <p> " The level of detail they went to in order to make everything authentic was incredible , " Melanie says of the powerful tale , which was shot during a harsh Slovakian winter . " It 's so hard to watch . And the thought that it 's recent history ? You know , it was not that long ago . Just thinking about what people do to each other ... <p> " There are so many things in history where people do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- there are survivors of horrific events . We should continue to talk about the things that have happened to avoid repeating history , if at all possible . " <p> With fellow Kiwi acting legend Robyn in Pike . <h> Q&amp;A <h> ' It 's complicated and heartbreaking ' <h> Melanie Lynskey talks to The Weekly about examining a dark time in human history in The Tattooist of Auschwitz . <p> Did you spend much time with author Heather Morris to prepare ? <p> I did spend a lot of time with her . She 's such a big personality and really fun . She was so generous with her time . She wrote me a beautiful email at one point where she pointed out that she 's a different person now at the end of this journey . She 's so confident and back then she was just figuring herself out . She had a lot of shyness and a lot of nerves , and was n't sure of herself . <p> What do you know about her relationship with Lale Sokolov , the subject of her book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this day , it 's one of the most important relationships of her life . They just loved each other so much and trusted each other so much . <p> What was it like working with Harvey Keitel ? <p> I was so excited before it began . Harvey has such an amazing body of work . He has done so many movies . If you look back over his filmography , there are classics and so many times where he had worked with directors who had n't yet proven themselves . Jane Campion when she did The Piano was n't the Jane Campion . Quentin Tarantino when he did Reservoir Dogs was n't the Quentin Tarantino . <p> Well , you could say Peter Jackson was n't Sir Peter Jackson when he directed your debut film Heavenly Creatures in 1994 . Maybe you can count yourself in that club too ? <p> I was in high school -- I turned 16 at the end of the shoot ! -- and I was already a fan of Peter Jackson . <p> How pivotal was that movie for you ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would be without it . It 's the definition of a lucky break . It 's kind of incredible that that happened to me and everything that came as a result . I thank my lucky stars . Not only getting a professional job at that age , but in a movie that was so special and still lives on to this day , and also working with people who had the generosity to teach me and help me learn . No one threw me into the deep end at all . There was a lot of support around me . <p> What sort of support ? <p> Having people who were acting coaches to help me . Then also working with Kate Winslet , who had been doing it for so long . She was so ready to be there for me and be a support system . A lot of people get thrown on to a project and just kind of have to figure it out . They gave me a whole day of filming where I was just learning how to hit a mark . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was , to be standing and not look at the camera , finding out where your light is ... What a gift . <p> Do you have other examples of positive workplace experiences as a young actor ? <p> When I worked on Ever After , Anjelica Huston was so incredible with me . Just so loving , and a big sister who also taught me so many practical things about camera angles and editing . It 's the little things you do n't think about . I worked with actress Katrin Cartlidge as well . To have had women who I got to work with , who wanted to help me learn , has been so incredible . There 's a mantra I love : " I do n't shine if you do n't shine . " I love that . That 's really nice . I do n't understand being competitive or petty . <p> Back to the series ... The Tattooist of Auschwitz is a story of both love and survival . What did it teach you about both of those things ? <p> The thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , " What lengths would you go to in order to survive ? And what would you do to protect the people you love ? " And the thing that got me -- especially when I read the script -- were the scenes of Lale really grappling with the truth of that , along with his own survivor 's guilt . His guilt at having made it and the fact that the love of his life also made it . It 's such a complicated , heartbreaking thing . <p> Did you have any personal connection to this time in history ? <p> Only learning about it in school . I remember being dumbfounded . It felt to me , when I was hearing about it , like it had just happened . It 's shocking . <p> With Harvey in The Tattooist of Auschwitz . <p> Before filming , did you do any extra research ? <p> I wanted to approach it as Heather did ... I came into it with a little more general knowledge maybe . Just because my history teacher was so great in high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everybody 's story is different . Tali Shalom-Ezer , our director , pointed out along the way that you ca n't tell the story of the Holocaust . There are so many stories and so many survivors who went through terrible , terrible things . As a whole , it 's too big to process . When you look at every individual story , there is a life , a family and people who loved each other . I have a five-year-old , so it 's hard for me not to imagine any of these terrible things . <p> How hard is it for you to leave work behind when you get back home ? <p> It 's actually not that difficult because my little one is such a joyful person . Just seeing her face , I feel such gratitude . Having my husband there -- they were with me in Slovakia -- sometimes I would just come home and have a big cry . Luckily , my husband is an actor and he gets it . <p> Is it rare to be able to take your family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to start elementary school , but before that , they came with me everywhere . They have always been with me . We had a rule that whoever 's job is the one that makes the most sense careerwise or financially , that will be the job we prioritise and he has had no ego about that . He 's like , " Yep , your job wins . I 'll go with you . " <p> As Heather is also a Kiwi , you were able to use your own accent in The Tattooist of Auschwitz . When was the last time you were able to do that ? <p> Recently I went home and made a movie Pike where I played a New Zealander , but before this ? I actually do n't know ! I have no idea . <p> Do you ever think about moving back to New Zealand ? <p> We lived in Auckland for three months while I was making this movie . It was October , November and December , which is when it starts to get warm and lovely . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't we live here ?

Others pointed to the empire 's architectural and engineering feats . <p> Rome was also known for its period of peace and prosperity which coincided with a warm climate trend that lasted 800 years from about 300BC to 500AD . It produced record harvests , and developed ideas of civic service , personal ambition and conspicuous consumption , particularly among the elites . <p> After 450 years , the world 's greatest empire was at its peak , stretching from Britain to Egypt .

Yet its cause and origins are still unknown . The best guess is that it spread from China , as many contemporary pandemics have , but Africa and India can not be ruled out . <p> The pathogen was first recorded by Western accounts in the southeastern parts of the empire , where Roman legionnaires were fighting the Parthians in modern Iraq . Modern researchers liken the pathogen to smallpox , except that it was deadly to adults rather than children . <p> It was highly infectious and left few survivors among people living in densely populated conditions , such as urban areas and armies . <p> Pagan Romans blamed it on Apollo , the god of healing and disease , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seleucia , the former capital of an empire that Rome conquered in 165AD . <p> Galen , Rome 's most famous physician , described it as a black rash covering the body . He was a maverick among the city 's doctors , who were mainly Greeks and widely despised for their exorbitant charges . <p> They had no cures for the plague , and Galen wisely fled the city , joining others who could afford country houses . They survived but millions did n't . Estimates range from 2% to 33% ; a conservative view of 10% was equivalent to a loss of 7-8 million . <p> The population loss had devasting economic effects . Historians do n't have a lot of evidence , but one certainty was the decline in silver mining due to lack of demand for coins . <p> Typically , such disease outbreaks bring calls for retribution and blame .

Christians numbered about 30-40,000 during the persecution . This would change dramatically after Constantine began his conversion to Christianity following his victory at the Battle of Milvian Bridge in 312AD . <p> Despite the depth and breadth of his research , Elliott keeps his text to a modest 240 pages .

A former diplomat , he was appointed to theHouse of Lords in 2020 . <p> OPINION <p> Decent man though he is , Rishi Sunak 's brief , tragic premiership has ended , though I wish it could have done so sooner . <p> Professor Norman Dixon 's landmark book , On the Psychology of Military Incompetence , showed how and why certain generals , seemingly well trained , clever , fitted for the job , nevertheless failed catastrophically at the job they were given . <p> In a case study of the failed British defence of Singapore in 1942 , Dixon wrote that " the more events proved them to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the case " , and that General Percival , their highly intelligent commander , showed " ineffectual leadership " : " passivity and courtesy , rigidity and obstinacy , procrastination , gentleness , and dogmatism " . <p> Overall , he identified a tendency to ignore inconvenient facts , to stay in well-trodden comfort zones and stick to routines and actions that had served them well in previous roles , to obsess about second-order issues rather than get to grips with the core problems , and to be frozen by indecision at critical moments . <p> Remind you of anything ? Perhaps , were he writing today , Professor Dixon would be tempted to pen On the Psychology of Political Incompetence . After all , the traits he identified have all been readily visible at the top of the Conservative Party in the last year . <p> That 's why we have tonight 's disastrous result -- and a disaster it is , if not quite the utter wipe-out some predicted . The strategy chosen by the outgoing Tory leadership -- to ignore the 2019 electoral coalition and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tilt Left-wards away from actual conservatism -- was a comfort zone plan , not one that engaged with the reality of the political situation . It was compounded by the inability to deliver anything important , the repeated failure to get to grips with illegal immigration , and the view that legal migration did n't matter , and the obsession with second order issues like the smoking ban . And the polls fell consistently as all this became more and more obvious to Conservative voters . <p> Many of us , beginning with Suella Braverman in her powerful resignation letter last autumn , have been pointing out that catastrophe was coming . We might as well have talked to the wall . The clique around the Prime Minister knew better . As poll after poll predicted disaster , we were told that Downing Street knew best .

The leadership of the party have simply failed to realise that trust in them is broken and instinctual loyalty to the party is largely gone . Hence tonight 's result . <p> Decent man though he is , Rishi Sunak 's brief , tragic premiership has ended , and it is best that it has done so , though I wish it could have been sooner .

They need to go and not be seen again . Then the Right of centre in British politics , those with actual conservative beliefs , whatever party they are in , can start to do what is necessary : unite behind a conservative vision with a coherent set of policies and the determination to deliver them . That is going to take time . All the more need to start soon . 
@@109965238 <p> Q : A cocktail or glass of wine helps me fall asleep on long flights . But are there downsides todrinking on a plane ? <p> A : After the bustle of boarding and the effort of squeezing your body and baggage into compact spaces , a drink or two may feel like just the ticket . <p> But the results of a small study published earlier this month suggest that there are certain risks associated with consuming alcohol on planes , especially on longer flights when you are planning to sleep . We asked experts about the new research , and how it fits with what they already know . <h> How altitude and alcohol affect your body <p> As a plane climbs , the oxygen level in the cabin drops , and that causes your blood oxygen level to decrease , said Dr Colin Church , a pulmonologist and senior lecturer at the University of Glasgow in Scotland . Drinking alcohol can increase your heart rate , he added , and it has been shown to reduce blood oxygen levels during sleep . <p> The new study was the first to examine the combined effects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ researcher at the Institute of Aerospace Medicine in Cologne , Germany , who led the study . <p> For the experiment , she and her colleagues recruited 48 healthy adults between ages 18 and 40 . Half completed the study in a sleep lab with normal air pressure . The other half slept in bunk beds in an altitude chamber with air pressure mimicking that on a plane . <p> Participants in both groups slept from midnight to 4am for two nights , one sober and one after having nearly 115 grams of vodka , an amount of alcohol similar to that found in two beers or glasses of wine . They wore devices to measure their blood oxygen levels , heart rates and sleep stages . <p> The participants sleeping at normal air pressure had an average blood oxygen level of 96% on the sober night and 95% on the drinking night . But for those sleeping in the altitude chamber , oxygen levels were at 88% when sober and 85% after drinking . <p> As for heart rate , the average during sleep at normal air pressure increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinking ; and at altitude , from 73 beats per minute when sober to 88 after drinking . <p> Lower blood oxygen levels and increased heart rates are evidence of strain on the cardiovascular system -- the heart has to work harder to compensate for the drop in oxygen , Sarraju said . <p> If you 're young and healthy , this type of strain on your heart may just leave you feeling a bit tired , Sarraju said . But if you have a cardiac or respiratory condition , such as heart failure , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or sleep apnea , it could make you lightheaded and short of breath , and drinking may increase your chances of having a medical emergency during the flight , he said . <p> Alcohol is also dehydrating , which may slightly increase your risk of developing a blood clot in your legs or lungs , Church said . <h> How in-flight alcohol may affect your sleep <p> Alcohol is a sedative , so if you drink close to bedtime , you 'll usually fall asleep faster , said Dr Alanna Hare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Society . In the study , those sleeping in the altitude chamber took 19 minutes , on average , to fall asleep when sober and 12.5 minutes after drinking . <p> But as your body breaks down the alcohol during the night , your " quality of sleep really deteriorates " and you 'll wake more frequently , said Dr Bhanu Kolla , a sleep medicine physician at the Mayo Clinic . As a result , you 'll probably feel less well-rested the next day , he said . <p> In the study , participants sleeping in the altitude chamber spent less time in deep and Rem sleep than those sleeping in normal air pressure . Alcohol compromised their sleep further : They woke more often , and compared with 22 minutes of Rem sleep when sober , they logged 14.5 minutes after drinking . <p> Alcohol can also relax the muscles around your upper airway , causing snoring -- and for those with sleep apnea , worsened symptoms , Kolla said . <p> Dehydration from alcohol may slightly increase the risk of blood clots during flights . Photo / @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sarraju said it 's best to avoid alcohol before or during a flight , especially if you have a heart or lung condition or sleep apnea . <p> If you do n't have one of those conditions , one drink is probably OK , Kolla said . But notice how you feel afterwards : If " you 're sleeping poorly on the flight , waking up with a headache , " you may be better off abstaining next time , he said . <p> In lieu of alcohol , Hare suggested a few alternate ways to wind down . " Do n't put pressure on yourself to sleep , " she said . But do get comfortable . Bring a travel pillow and eye mask , and use ear plugs or listen to calming music , white noise or a podcast with headphones .

Photo / New York Times <p> The signs of chronic illness are often dismissed by doctors as " just stress . " But that comes from a complex relationship between sickness and stress itself . <p> Amina AlTai had always prided herself on herdrive and resilience . When she began experiencing brain fog and fatigue , AlTai , 39 , simply thought it was from working long hours in her marketing job . So she started writing down reminders to keep herself on track .

Go to the hospital instead , because you 're days away from multiple organ failure , ' " AlTai remembered . The two chronic diseases had upended her ability to regulate hormones and absorb critical vitamins and nutrients . <p> Scientists now know that stress is intimately linked with many chronic diseases : It can drive immune changes and inflammation in the body that can worsen symptoms of conditions like asthma , heart disease , arthritis , lupus and inflammatory bowel disease .

When we encounter a threat , our blood pressure and heart rate climb , muscles tense and our body concentrates blood sugar to make it easier to react quickly , said Dr Charles Hattemer , a specialist in cardiovascular health at the University of Cincinnati . <p> If people are stressed for weeks or months , their bodies may be unable to keep up as well with other functions , leading to problems like forgetfulness , fatigue and trouble sleeping .

" Her response to me was basically , ' This is your problem . You go solve it . ' " <p> Patients said that instead of simply suggesting they cut out sources of stress , doctors could work with them on small ways they can manage stress every day .

Here we explore the options for buyers and what to look for . <p> With a new seventh-generation Ford Mustang arriving soon , you might daydream about putting a horse in the stable . But with the Mustang GT starting at $92,990 , it 's no longer the semi-affordable sports car it once was . <p> Given the desirability of having the steering wheel on the right hand side of the cabin , the values of the S550 Mustang are holding up , early examples around the $50k mark , and heading north from there . <p> Meanwhile , the fifth-gen S197 can now be had for as little as $25k , albeit for a high mileage example . There are around 1900 of these S197s in New Zealand , all imported over the years as Ford NZ never sold it new here . <p> You can pay more too , the specials like the GT500 and Boss still commanding $70k plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2004 Detroit motor show . Clothed in ' retro-futurism ' styling , it attempted to capture the evocative design of the first-generation pony car . It had all the styling elements of the past ; the grille , long bonnet , fastback roofline and taillights all incorporated in a modernised silhouette . <p> Unlike the previous generations , it was a Mustang that looked like a Mustang should . <p> As we put it from our first test of the convertible back in 2006 " Ford has successfully encapsulated the feel-good shape , look , and appeal of the original Mustang , and injected all the best of modern advancements into the recipe of this new GT " . <p> The S197 gained a platform that was new at the time , novel for a Mustang given they had previously been spun off an existing chassis to save money . It was shared with the likes of the Lincoln LS and Jaguar S-Type . <p> However , Ford did cut costs by equipping the Mustang with a solid rear axle . That , they said , was part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an attempt to deflect the criticism of such penny pinching . <p> This three-link configuration with a panhard rod and sway bar worked as intended however . <p> When NZ Autocar tested a Fastback GT in ' 05 we noted " It 's oh so easy to reel off these performance numbers , the live rear squatting under the power but hooking up sweetly while the auto handles the torque efficiently and quickly " . It turned in a 0-100km/h time of 5.9sec , if you 're wondering . <p> The first of the S197s ran from 2005 to 2010 , the base car with the 157kW 4.0 V6 but you 'll be more interested in the GT . That gained an alloy block 4.6-litre OHC three-valver , the so-called Modular V8 . <p> Complete with variable camshaft timing it produced 224kW at 5750rpm , and peak twist of 434Nm at 4500rpm . Ford 's 5R55S five-speed auto shifted the gears in the GT while the three-pedal version used a Tremec TR-3650 , also with five gears . <p> In 2010 came a revised exterior design and a few more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with improved suspension . A year later , the 5.0 returned for the Mustang , the Coyote with 307kW and 530Nm . <p> New transmissions helped the cause with a ZF-sourced six-speed auto and a new Tremec six-speed manual . <h> Two careful owners <p> The owner of this grabber orange 2007 GT , Steve Cropp , was n't initially after a Mustang when he bought it back in 2019 . He was on his way to buy a C6 Corvette but when that did n't quite check out he spotted a pristine condition GT sitting in the Ford dealership in Paeroa . <p> " I wanted something that was absolutely mint , otherwise I was n't interested . This had only done 9000 miles and it was owned by Kevin Pascoe of Pascoe Ford . <p> He had imported it new from the US . He told me it had never been on a wet road . It 's just immaculate ; the paint 's the same condition underneath as it is on top . " <p> It 's claimed that the Mustang is the world 's most modified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy , most being simple swap jobs . <p> When Steve bought his GT , it was sitting up high at its factory ride height with its five-spoke alloys . His first task was to set the ride height right with a two and a half inch drop . The GT originally rolled on either 17- or 18-inch wheels , the aspect ratio of the tyre high to mimic the 60 's look . <p> But the S197 takes well to being dropped on more modern rolling stock , the result here looking the part . The other must-do is an exhaust upgrade to liberate the eight 's rumble . Here , a set of cat-back pipes do the job well , all without the drone . <p> It 's a weekend cruiser for Steve , who is a part-time resident of Whangamata which is where the car spends most of its life .

There are air ride kits available , caster and camber plates , coilover set-ups and replacement control arms , Panhard rods , and roll bars . <p> The S197 is a popular club racer in the US , with many suspension kits available if you have the circuit in mind . Or if you prefer drag racing , more links to ' stop the hop ' coming off the line . <p> Under the bonnet , an induction kit helps this GT breathe better , and a good tune to match the air flow in and out is essential . <p> Yes , there are supercharger options too , but best to pony up for the GT500 version ; blown from the factory is always best . <p> The 500 was first introduced in 2007 , Ford 's SVT division utilising a supercharged 5.4-litre DOHC V8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The final 2014 version of the 500 was making a serious 494kW . <h> What to look for <p> Given the S197 is still a modern machine , you 'll be spending more time driving and less time fixing broken and worn out bits . As mileage creeps up though , problems will appear . <p> The 4.6 is regarded as a durable engine , but you 'll eventually be looking at replacing timing chains , camshaft timing solenoids and oil pumps on older , well used examples . Sensors fail as they age , as do coil packs and alternators . <p> Low mileage cars might not have had the original two-piece spark plugs changed . These can apparently snap when changing them without the right knowledge/tools . <p> Do n't be tempted by the V6 , it 's a dog with catastrophic timing chain , harmonic balancer and thermostat failures . <p> All S197s seem to develop axle oil leaks from the pinion seal . The five-speed auto is a robust unit , rated to handle more torque than the V8 makes , and lasts well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slushiness out of the equation . <p> While the newer facelift cars experience fewer issues , the Getrag MT82 six-speed manual transmission has been known to cause grief with prematurely worn synchros and hard-to-engage gears . <p> The not-so-great aspect of the S197 is the plastic interior . Squeaks and rattles come with age but it 's pretty robust , save for the door panels ; the adhesive gives out and the material peels off . <p> The frameless doors are another retro-cool aspect but the seals need to be good . Otherwise water will make its way into the passenger footwell where an electronic board lives . <p> Early convertibles can suffer chassis flex/cowl shake as they get older . Ford added more chassis strengtheners in the 2010 update , which can be retrofitted to older models too . <h> So should you saddle up ? <p> Quoting again from our test of the ' 06 convertible GT , we noted " Behind the wheel , it has all the attributes you desire . <p> Its nicely weighted , modern rack-and-pinion steering gives a healthy dose of road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good , strong , reliable brakes with a progressive motion to the pedal . <p> While the handling excels at straight-line cruising , the suspension can cope with a decent strop through the twisties thanks to the compliant nature of the damping and action of the roll bars . <p> With its softer set-up , the convertible is n't quite as sharp as the hard-top but is still more than passable " . <p> NZ Autocar is New Zealand 's leading automotive magazine .

Beet pulp has an average non-structural carbohydrate content of about 12 per cent , making it a good choice for those trying to lower sugar and starch levels in their horse 's diet . <p> If you 're feeding beet pulp that has molasses added , you can reduce the sugar level further by draining off excess water after soaking . This water will contain most of the sugar from the dried molasses . <p> Beet pulp is also an excellent option for horses whose worn teeth mean they struggle with hay , or for horses who do n't much care for the winter hay you 're offering , but need some extra calories to maintain condition . It 's an added bonus when it comes with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dusty and some of your horses are developing a cough ? Beet pulp is a viable alternative if you 're unable to source better quality hay elsewhere . <p> Remember , however , that any feed change needs to be introduced gradually , even when it 's a lovely fibrous offering like beet pulp . <p> One kilogram of dry beet pulp will deliver between 2400 calories and 2850 calories . Around 65 per cent will be digestible nutrients . Crude protein is likely to be in the 7-8 per cent range ( and digestible protein around 5 per cent ) , while crude fibre is in the 18-22 per cent range . Its calcium levels are good -- around 0.8 per cent to 1.1 per cent , but its phosphorus levels are very low -- 0.07 to 0.1 per cent . <p> Let 's see how this compares to some other common feeds . Oats deliver around 3300 calories per kilogram . Total digestible nutrients add up to around 75% and crude protein to around 13.5 per cent ( digestible protein is about 10.5 per cent ) . Crude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around 12 per cent , and while calcium is low ( around 0.07 per cent ) it delivers much better on phosphorus ( 0.37 per cent ) . <p> Let 's see how it looks against lucerne ( alfalfa ) hay : Total digestible nutrients stand at around 52 per cent , with 16 per cent crude protein ( and 11.5 per cent digestible protein ) . Crude fibre is 32 per cent . Lucerne provides 1.5 per cent calcium and 0.25 per cent phosphorus . Even meadow hay is likely to do a better job balancing the calcium-phosphorous equation than beet pulp , providing 0.41 per cent of the former and 0.25 per cent of the latter . <p> The key message is that while beet pulp provides a wealth of easily digestible fibre and horses enjoy it , it is not a balanced feed and should not be considered a grain substitute . Besides being very low in phosphorous , it is also low in Vitamin A , Vitamin B and selenium . <p> Its main weakness is the poor balance between calcium and phosphorous . A proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially with younger stock . <p> If you 're feeding larger quantities to youngsters , the relatively high calcium level and low phosphorus content could interfere with normal bone development unless you supplement the diet to correct the imbalance . <p> The high calcium levels also increase the risk of kidney stones in older horses and could set off the development of intestinal stones in horses of any age . <p> Some equine nutritionists believe beet pulp should not comprise more than a quarter of your horse 's total daily diet , and even less for growing horses in which bone development is so important . <p> If beet pulp is a part of your horse 's diet , it 's important to ensure you supplement it appropriately to provide a dietary balance . <p> Provided you 're balancing your horse 's nutritional requirements with a fortified horse feed , the following 1-2-3 rule is a good guide : do n't feed more than ONE kilogram daily ration of beet pulp ( that 's dry-weight ) to any horse under one year of age ; do n't feed more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the ages of one and three ; and do n't feed more than THREE kilograms to a mature horse ( assuming a body weight of around 500kg ) . <p> That said , always read the instructions on the packaging carefully and follow the manufacturer 's feeding guidelines . <h> One thought on " Pulp non-fiction : A horse owner 's guide to sugar beet " <p> A very interesting article . I am wondering about freshly dug up , still in the field/ from the field , and unprocessed sugar beet ? I live in in eastern Montana ( USA ) and it is mid to late fall now and PLENTY of sugar beet harvesting is happening all around near me right now . I can essentially get tons of spilled and leftover sugar beets in the fields from neighbors for free . These sugar beets are about softball to volleyball sized and are quite sweet . I ca n't seem to get a straight answer from others around here about feeding them to my horses .

The iconic venue will continue to be known as Go Media Stadium until 2028 . <p> New A-League club Auckland FC have partnered with Auckland Stadiums to play their home games at Go Media Stadium for their first five years of competition , while basing their training and administrative headquarters at North Harbour Stadium . <p> In anticipation of increased use for Go Media Stadium with both the Warriors and Auckland FC to play their home matches at the venue , Go Media co-owner Mike Gray revealed that a second big screen would be built with an aim to be ready for use for Auckland FC 's first home A-League game . <p> Also revealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first competition match of their existence , would be October 19 this year . <p> Gray told the Herald the second screen will be built in the same position as the old scoreboard at the southern end of the ground in order to make use of existing infrastructure . <p> " That was the scoreboard from the Commonwealth Games .

Given the demands ( often unjustified and unfair ) that many visiting celebrities and artists make before , during and after their performances , watching shows such as ' Kapoors : A Tribute to the Kapoor Family ' should inspire commercial organisations and philanthropists to sponsor and encourage such shows that involve local performers . <p> The show under review , conceived and presented by Arif Zia through his Creation Group New Zealand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delight .

With the Olympics approaching , its performance-boosting powers willsoon be under the spotlight again . When prisons are overcrowded , crime levels rise , testosterone is fingered as the culprit . In 2008 , the chair of the International Monetary Fund even blamed it for the financial crash , saying : " I honestly think that there should never be too much testosterone in one room . " <p> " We 've chosen to vilify testosterone because of its mis-association with aggression . But that 's just factually incorrect , " says Dr Rob Stevens , founder of The Men 's Health Clinic in Dorset . " Testosterone is actually a calming hormone . It 's the counterbalance to cortisol -- the stress hormone . " <p> In fact , we may have got testosterone all wrong . A 2022 review of available studies found no association between the hormone and muscle mass , strength or performance in women . Other rigorous studies have found little relationship between it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for men , and in fact for women too , it can sometimes be the key to improving your midlife health and relationships . <h> What is testosterone ? <p> The hormone got its name in 1935 , when Ernest Laqueur isolated it from bull testes . But people ( mostly , it must be said , men ) had been excited for centuries about a substance that , once extracted from testicles , might bestow mythical powers of masculinity on its recipient . Injectable serums were made from dog and guinea pig testicles in the 1880s . By the 1920s , a Russian surgeon called Serge Abrahamovitch Voronoff was doing a roaring trade in inserting slices of baboon and chimpanzee testicles into the scrotums of human patients , while making dazzling claims for the impact on memory , eyesight and libido . As researchers Rebecca Jordan-Young and Katrina Karkazis write in their book Testosterone , An Unauthorised Biography , " it 's a lot to pin on a simple molecule " which in fact , is : " neither the biological essence of manliness nor even ' the male @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know about testosterone 's impact ? Well , it 's true that , in men , testosterone is principally produced in the testicles , and plays a vital role in sperm production and sex drive . But it also affects bone and muscle mass , fat distribution , and the production of red blood cells . <p> Nor is it just for men . Women make it in their ovaries , too . As Jordan-Young and Karkazis point out , it is the single most abundant biologically active female hormone , essential for women 's physical and mental health . Alongside oestrogen and progesterone , it helps support ovulation but also contributes to lean body mass , bone health , cognition , mood and more . So , it is not only confined to the sex organs . Testosterone receptors are found in almost all tissues in the human body . <p> This , Stevens stresses , does not imply that men are going through anything similar to menopause : " There 's no such thing as the male menopause " . But the process can be gruelling for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got plenty of patients in their 50s who come for screening and find they have very healthy testosterone levels , " he says . " That 's normally as a result of leading a healthy , active life and not being under the constant psychological pressure that many of us suffer as a consequence of our psychologically challenging jobs . " <p> Women , meanwhile , get a spike of testosterone around the time of ovulation , explains Dr Kim Ruddy , GP and menopause specialist . These spikes get gradually shallower once you leave your 20s behind . Unlike oestrogen and progesterone levels , which change dramatically during the perimenopause : " it 's a gradual deterioration with age , says Ruddy . " It does n't suddenly strike you but by the time you 're in your 50s , it 's very normal to have low testosterone . " <h> Low testosterone in men -- the consequences <p> This gradual slide may sound depressing , but it does not necessarily cause problems . A 2002 study found no link between the process and risk of erectile dysfunction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> For some men , however , the impact can be profound . The NHS will prescribe testosterone replacement therapy to men with pathological hypogonadism ( a diagnosed shortage of the hormone ) , as it is proven to improve sexual function in such cases . Yet for many others , says Stevens , " the symptoms have very little to do with libido . The major presenting symptoms in my clinic are mental discord , whether that manifests as low mood or anxiety , then fatigue , then brain fog , and only after that comes reduced libido . " <p> Testosterone levels in men decline by 1% annually after age 30 . Photo / 123rf <h> Low testosterone in women -- the consequences <p> " Historically , testosterone has not been considered to be particularly important for women in midlife , " says Ruddy .

It can have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact : " about 25% of menopausal women will suffer from hypoactive sexual desire disorder ( HSDD ) , " explains Dr Louise Newson , GP , menopause expert and the founder of Newson Health . " Basically , they 'll get a really low libido . Testosterone has been shown to help significantly with that . " <p> Nice guidelines now allow for testosterone to be prescribed to women suffering from low libido . " But what I 've found is that for most women , when they 've been on it for six months or so , they start describing additional benefits , " says Ruddy . " It makes them feel a bit sharper , they feel more comfortable in their body , they sleep better , they report better brain function . " <h> The different ways of taking testosterone <p> Perhaps unsurprisingly then , NHS prescriptions for testosterone for menopause have increased by around tenfold over the past decade . But here 's the rub . " In the NHS we can only prescribe sachets of a gel called Testogel , or another in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both are basically male products . Where men can just open the sachet and use the whole thing , women have to estimate an 8th of a sachet to apply each day , " explains Ruddy . A licensed female-specific product , AndroFem , is only available privately . <p> The landscape is rather different for men . In addition to these products , the NHS also prescribes three-monthly injections of a long-acting formulation called Nebido , and Sustanon -- a combination of four forms of testosterone that requires injection every two to four weeks . Go private , and the possibilities expand still further . Stevens ' clinic , for example , prescribes daily injections , which patients give themselves at home . These microdoses " mimicking the body 's physiology as closely as possible , " he explains , creating more stable and steady levels . <h> What are the side effects ? <p> For women , the most common side effects are excess hair growth , acne and weight gain , says the British Menopause Society . These usually settle down with a decreased dosage , stresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry for men .

Your natural production of testosterone can also be reduced , leading to a reduction in sperm production and thus your fertility . So alongside testosterone , Stevens ' clinic administers hCG or human chorionic gonadotropin -- a female pregnancy hormone that helps preserve testicular size , function and fertility when given to men undergoing TRT by mimicking Lutenising Hormone which stimulates testosterone production . <p> It 's not the magic bullet , he stresses .

Photo / Getty Images <p> The emperor of all maladies has stalked my family this year . From my father ( multiple myeloma ) to my cousins ( multiple myeloma and throat cancer , respectively ) , and myself ( melanoma ) , it 's been the year of cancer , andwe are only halfway through it . <p> We 've been bombarded with medical information in meetings with oncologists and doctors , some of it quite complex and scary . After emerging bewildered from one medical appointment , unsure exactly of what was agreed , I decided to record the following ones . <p> I feed the recordings into Otter.ai , a software application I use on my phone to automatically transcribe the interviews I do each week . Automatic transcription has transformed journalism , cutting hours out of a process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laboriously typing out the interviewee 's quotes . <p> But in the past 18 months or so , Otter has also harnessed the latest developments in artificial intelligence to present conversation summaries alongside the transcriptions . It will tell you the key points discussed and highlight any decisions or action points that came out of the meeting . The AI-generated notes provide a reliable reference for discussing our medical issues . <p> General practitioners , overwhelmed with patients and admin , are doing the same thing . In February , I met South Auckland GP Karl Cole , who is an enthusiastic adopter of AI for recording and summarising his meetings with patients . " I do n't use the word lightly , but this has been a game changer , and probably stopped me from burning out , " he says . <p> Cole uses the Nabla Copilot app , and estimates it saves him about an hour a day of writing up clinical notes . It allows him to focus more on direct patient care and complex decision-making . The summary notes also empower patients to take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GP does n't use AI yet , and Manage my Health , the online portal the practice uses , gives a fragmented picture of my health . There are test results that are hard to decipher , and no record of what was discussed during appointments . Hospital-related documents do n't necessarily go into Manage My Health . <p> Primary care providers such as GPs are relatively free to introduce AI tools , but a lot more regulation and red tape needs to be navigated to allow AI to be more widely used in the wider health system . <p> Cole sees much greater value being realised when AI-powered clinical notes are connected to your electronic health record so current and past medical conditions , treatments and drug regimes are included . The sooner we sort this out the better . <p> " We now have nearly 900,000 people over 65 , " he says . " Some of them have three or four health problems .

Clear policies regarding the storage , use , and sharing of recordings must be established to protect patient privacy . <p> AI has tremendous potential to provide insights humans might not think of . An AI trained in diabetes , drawing on anonymised patient data , might be able to read meeting transcripts and suggest treatments for the doctor to consider . <p> Given the pressures on public health services , removing the admin burden on doctors will pay dividends for the nation 's health .

Like any other asset class , crypto is intrinsically linked to world events - but often behaves in the complete opposite manner ... <p> Paul Quickenden , blockchain futurist and Chief Commercial Officer at Easy Crypto , weighs in on recent world events and their effect on crypto pricing ; and gives some sage advice to investors ... <h> A real-life episode of Black Mirror ? <p> " What happens when the global banking system ' goes down ' ? " It 's a question that usually has the anti-crypto crowd accusing those of asking the question of spreading dystopian views . Yet ... this past weekend , in a real-life version of what might have felt a bit like ' Black Mirror ' ( a speculative fiction series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiction became fact and banking - along with flight operations and hospital administration - ' went down ' . A faulty update by a US cyber security firm disrupted 8.5 million Windows devices around the globe and people literally could n't pay for their meals , shopping or other critical services . <p> In very simplistic terms , this ' scare ' caused many people ( including the sceptics ) to look at crypto through a brand new set of lenses . With their traditional means of transacting destabilised/unavailable ; could crypto provide an alternative ? The answer , of course , is YES . While banks and payment systems were down , those of us with stablecoins and other cryptos were able to transact freely ; once again proving the strength and resilience of decentralised networks . <h> Single point of failure = big problem <p> For the first time , the logic of decentralised value exchange systems like Bitcoin and stablecoins jolted into reality for many . <p> It turns out that the banks and airlines were all using the same service provider ( CrowdStrike ) ; exponentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will only be exacerbated with the arrival of AI systems that are controlled by single entities but relied on by many . <p> Unlike banking , currencies like Bitcon and Ethereum avoid having a single point of failure because they have thousands of ' nodes ' ( computers that participate in the blockchain network ) . These nodes help ensure that no single entity can control the network , and they also provide massive resilience as many nodes can go offline and the network can continue to perform without any material service disruption . By using the innovative technologies of blockchains and having a diverse and distributed network of nodes - the resilience , trustworthiness and integrity of crypto is now provably superior . <h> Resulting price volatility explained <p> Like other assets such as stocks , crypto trading is often driven by narratives and speculation which can lead to price swings as traders react to news , rumours and market sentiment . <p> This is exactly what happened this weekend ; butit 's important to remember that these movements in price can often be as fickle as our daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event that triggered the market movements .

When designing a balanced investment portfolio , investors will often look to achieve diversification through assets with low or negative correlation . This simply means that when one of their asset classes is performing well , another one might be flat or declining in value , and this helps balance overall risk .

DCA mitigates the impact of short-term price fluctuations by averaging out costs over time and promoting a steady accumulation of assets . <p> The Hold-On-for-Dear-Life ( HODL ) strategy : In a market rife with volatility , the HODL mantra focuses on the importance of long-term conviction over short-term speculation . By focusing on the intrinsic value and fundamentals of assets , rather than succumbing to market hysteria , investors can cultivate their resilience . <p> Diversification : Diversification remains a cornerstone of sound investment practice , and sees investors spread investments across different assets ( such as types of coins ) to minimise risk from volatile market swings . A diversified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The weekend 's events underscored the fragility of our traditional financial systems and highlighted the potential of crypto as a resilient alternative that offers continuous transaction capabilities unaffected by centralised failures .

Then my daughter made me go back onto the dating app Hinge , " says Lorna , 56 . " The next day , I saw Mike 's profile and thought he looked lovely , so I pressed the ' Match ' button . " <p> But while Mike was super-keen to meet Lorna , it almost did n't happen . <p> " After my marriage broke up , I had another relationship which did n't work out . I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though , so I decided to give it a try , " says electrics manufacturing company owner Mike , 55 , who has three children , Ella , 21 , Matthew , 17 , and Peter , 15 . <p> " Within 40 minutes of opening the app , I came across Lorna 's profile . I went to match with her , but one of my staff walked into my office . I got such a fright because I did n't want them to see I was on a dating app , that I accidentally deleted her ! " <p> Once Mike realised he could n't undo what he 'd done on the app , he figured out a plan B. " Because I knew where she worked , I sent a message to the generic email address at Coast FM . I asked if they 'd pass on a message to her saying I 'd deleted her and could she re-add me ? Then once we were in touch , I sent her an email with all the information she would have seen on the app if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from my web editor saying I had a stalker ! " laughs Lorna , who lives on Auckland 's North Shore with daughter Lucy , Lucy 's daughter Kaia , two , and Zoe , 15 . " But I was intrigued and from the get-go , we just clicked . We are like yin and yang -- he has four sisters and I have three brothers , and I have a household of girls , while he lives in an all-boy household . " <p> In one email , Mike mentioned that like Lorna , he loves music . He had two tickets to a James Taylor concert the next day and invited her to come . When that went well , the pair arranged a second date at a gin festival . " Nothing breaks the ice like a gin festival ! " laughs Lorna . " We had such a good time . We met a couple of ladies from Christchurch who thought we were married . They could n't believe it when we said it was our second date ! In the end , we told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , please get in touch ! " <p> So that begs the question -- has marriage been discussed ? " Yes , it has , " smiles Lorna coyly . <p> Mike explains , " We 're absolutely talking about living together . We 're just trying to work out the children 's needs at the moment . My youngest son , who lives with me part-time , goes to school near where I live , and Zoe 's school is in a different part of Auckland . " <p> Adds Lorna , " I think it 's fair to say that if we had no one else to consider , we 'd already be living together . Before I met Mike , I was in the process of buying a house . It was never my intention to live in a rental for this long . It just worked out that way because I have Lucy and Kaia staying with me . <p> " At the time , I could see myself living there , but now things have changed . My son Max and his girlfriend are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end up living there . " <p> Last month , Lorna and Mike enjoyed a romantic getaway to Queenstown . The couple also recently travelled to Perth , taking Zoe and Peter with them , so Lorna could get to know Mike 's eldest daughter Ella . The pair also want to make completely sure they travel well together as it 's something they plan to do a lot of in the future . <p> " We 've both had failed relationships we did n't want to repeat , but you do n't expect to meet someone who matches in quite the way Lorna and I do , " says Mike , who spends his spare time repairing , restoring and selling vintage cameras . " We meld together very easily . Our personalities , our thinking , parenting ... " <p> " ... Our philosophy on life , " continues Lorna . <p> " We both love music and travel , " inserts Mike . <p> " And we love looking after other people , " finishes Lorna . <p> It 's clear there 's a deep affection between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during our interview , while Lorna ca n't wipe the smile off her face . <p> " Mike is the most supportive , caring and generous person I 've ever met , " she enthuses . " With Mike , I feel like I 've found home . It 's so refreshing to be able to completely be yourself and know you 're with someone who really cherishes you . " <p> Adds Mike , " Lorna holds her heart and her soul out in front of her . She has such a big heart and the way she cares for her children is just lovely . We are both the type of people who will try to look after other people 's needs and that type of relationship wears people like us out . So it 's wonderful to be in a partnership where each of us wants the other to just be who we are . " <p> While the pair could be said to be looking through rose-tinted glasses at such an early stage in their relationship , their kids are a great barometer . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We all just feel like rather than having to try to make it work , our extended family has just got bigger . Zoe did n't even want me to get a boyfriend , but the other day she said , ' Mum , I think Mike 's almost too good to be true . ' <p> " And my parents live in Hawke 's Bay , which is where Mike 's from , so he went to visit them without me and they love him ! " <p> On their return from Perth , the couple will go to Hawke 's Bay in time to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Lorna 's parents , Gavin and Doreen , immigrating to New Zealand from England . <p> " We 've been surprised by how well the families have just gone with it , " says Mike . " Nobody has brought in any extra rules or new ways . We all have dinner together and get on really well . " <p> The adventure-loving pair in Queenstown . <p> The pair is well aware that their relationship is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well matched that they see no reason to slow things down . They have n't even had a single argument ! <p> " Issues have come up , but we 've just talked them through like grown-ups , " says Lorna . " We know it 'll happen -- knowing how we deal with conflict resolution is n't something we 've had to deal with yet . But we are n't conflict people , so we tend to handle things before they become an issue . " <p> One aspect they have discussed , however , is Lorna 's experience with breast cancer . <p> " Lorna 's cancer journey has been documented so I knew about it before we met , " tells Mike . " My grandmother , mother and sister have all had breast cancer , and I have friends with different types of cancer . I have n't known Lorna when she 's unwell and I did n't know the Lorna who had long blonde hair before she had cancer . But I know this Lorna , and I have no concerns . <p> " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and decide that them having cancer is a deal-breaker . At the gin festival , I said to her that at that moment , there were probably 50-odd people in the room with cancer . Some who knew about it and some who maybe had n't been diagnosed yet . And I could be one of them . <p> " We 're at the age where doctors find stuff like cancer and other illnesses . She 's being monitored closely and whatever happens , I 'm here for her . " <p> Mike 's unwavering support and love has persuaded Lorna to take the next step -- having the double mastectomy she 's been putting off . ' <p> " Because I 've had breast cancer twice , and I have the BRCA2 gene , my oncologist told me it would be wise to have it . If they find something again , even if it 's really small , I 'll have to go through chemo again . I do n't want to do that , " she tells . " I 've been delaying for all sorts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do it . Now Mike is here to look after me and the family , I 've booked it in for next February . " <p> And Mike is n't just unfazed -- he 's completely ready . " I see us as a herd -- kind of like in the Ice Age movies , " he smiles . " Everything we do now is for the wider family .

Photo / Getty Images <p> Online exclusive <p> What 's It Like To Be ... is a fortnightly column where New Zealanders from all walks of life share first-hand experiences . Here , David Mahutonga talks about living with hepatitis B. It was discovered whenhe was 35 , leading to liver cancer and ultimately a liver transplant . <p> I was about 35 when I found out I had hepatitis . My oldest daughter and I were living in Rotorua , and we went past this caravan that just happened to be doing hepatitis tests . She said , " Let 's go and have a try . " I got some results a couple of weeks later , telling me that I had hepatitis B. <p> Looking back , there were a few clues that I might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had a bout when I was a kid - I remember it made me go yellow . But after that , I recovered and was back to normal , as far as I remember . <p> Then when I was a teenager , the blood collection people rejected my blood because of hepatitis . But there were no explanations , so I thought nothing more of it . I thought it might be a one-off and carried on . I thought I would n't bother trying to donate any more blood . <p> When my hepatitis was finally picked up properly , the Hepatitis Foundation told me it would enrol me in its monitoring programme . I did n't have any symptoms or illness , but I was tested every six months . It went on like that for about 20 years . Then in 2021 , I was told I had some bad blood samples and I went for an MRI scan . After some more tests , a specialist told me I had cancer of the liver . <p> I live in Taranaki but had my first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay but the next time I went up there , the team asked me if I would entertain the thought of a liver transplant . I was n't really sick or anything like that though , so I quizzed them . I said , " I do n't feel that bad , so why do n't I just hold on to it for a bit to use any goodness left in it , then think about a transplant ? " <p> David Mahutonga , with his mokopuna , likely had hepatitis since childhood but like many New Zealanders had no symptoms . Photo / supplied <p> But the gastroenterologist , Dr David Orr , told me liver cancer does n't work that way . He said without the transplant , I might be able to come and see him next year . And then the year after , there was only a 50% chance I would be alive to see him and a year after that , I definitely would n't be around to see him . So a transplant was a bit of a no-brainer . <p> They told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital for seven days . Then they released me , but I had to stay in Auckland . I was in a hotel for a few weeks and then spent a further few weeks in a transplant house attached to Auckland City Hospital . All my meds were being balanced out at that stage . There were steroids and other bits and pieces , but the big thing was the anti-rejection pills . <p> My recovery went so well that I went back to work full time in December 2022 . <p> Now , I have to take good care of my liver . I do n't drink alcohol and I also have diabetes , so I pretty much eat zero sugar . Occasionally , I 'll have a bit of ice cream or chocolate for a treat but it 's pretty infrequent . <p> Hepatitis can lie dormant and come back ; it 's the disease that keeps on giving . I will always have to be monitored and be careful . I will have to take pills for the rest of my life . <p> But even with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to retire and ca n't wait . I 've got so many things to do , like working on my house . I also do a lot of work out at the pa , at my marae . I 've got six kids and four grandkids - the eldest is 6 years old - and I get involved in a lot of family things . I missed out on some of this stuff as I was a shift worker , so I want to make up for some of those things . I 'm pretty sure I 'm going to live a full life . <p> Not long ago , the transplant team asked me to a seminar being held in Asia . The team wanted to have someone talk who could give their story . <p> I was only too glad to , really , just to say thanks and to share how the foundation 's early warning system works . It was so good for me . I got sick , but not like some of the guys that I 've met and seen . <p> More about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B is a contagious virus that affects the liver . About 94,000 New Zealanders have chronic hepatitis B and 60% of these will be undiagnosed . Many of those infected do n't have any symptoms . Unmonitored , hepatitis B can cause liver damage and , eventually , cancer . Hepatitis C is the leading cause for liver transplant and affects about 30,000 New Zealanders . As with Hepatitis B , many people wo n't know they have it . Visit the Hepatitis Foundation New Zealand for more information . 
@@111447239 <p> NZ Herald deputy political editor Thomas Coughlan told The Front Page that the tax changes come in two parts . One of them is that all the tax brackets except the top part have been adjusted upwards by around 11.5% . <p> He said that those changes have not happened for 14 years , and were needed to prevent marginal tax rate creep . <p> " That would have meant that this year , for the first time , someone earning the fulltime minimum wage would have had part of their income taxed at 30% . Not much , it would have only been a few hundred dollars taxed at 30% , but it would be quite a historic event to see someone on the minimum wage working fulltime being taxed at such a high , high rate . " <p> The second part of the tax changes is an adjustment to various schemes the Government has , such as the Family Boost Tax Credit -- parents can now get $75 a week back if their children are in early childhood care -- and the Independent Earner Tax Credit -- which is $10 a week for people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but are still struggling . <p> Speaking to The Front Page , Auckland Central Budgeting 's general manager Teresa White said she does n't expect the money will go far for many people . <p> " My expectation is that most people 's tax cuts will likely be swallowed by household bills . If you kind of do a bit of the math -- I just did a quick calculation , and for me , I 'm set to get maybe $15 a week , but my rates are going up and my insurance has gone up , and I have to pay full price for my daughter 's school bus fares , and the doctors have gone up . <p> " So I think it will help pay for those things that are already risen or already gone , and kind of bring us back to where we were maybe six months ago . " <p> If people are able to benefit from the cut , White said that they should use it to save and build up a buffer . <p> " That 's my biggest learning from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put aside very much , and when times are tough , they 've got nothing to dip into . So I would really encourage people to do that . And pay down debt , get rid of it while you can . It 's just that the interest on debt is an absolute killer .

@@112070230 <p> This International Day of the World 's Indigenous Peoples , the Global People 's Caravan for Food , Land , and Climate Justice stands in firm solidarity with Indigenous communities worldwide . We honor and support their resolute struggle for land and resources as they #FightForOurFuture towards our collective goal of just , equitable , healthy and sustainable food systems . <p> We recognize that Indigenous Peoples are the guardians of over 50% of our planet 's lands , despite only 10% being officially recognized as theirs . Their traditional knowledge and sustainable agricultural practices are crucial for preserving biodiversity , mitigating climate change , and ensuring global food security . Yet , despite token recognition by the United Nations and its Member States , the widespread exploitation and plunder of ancestral lands led by transnational corporations , governments , international financial institutions , and other imperialist forces in collaboration with local elites continue unabated . <p> We stand in unwavering solidarity with Indigenous communities worldwide , who bravely defend their lands , resources , livelihoods , and ways of life against profit-driven encroachment , exploitation , and destruction . We support the Adi people and the Adivasi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their fight against palm oil plantations in Indonesia ; the Sengwer in their struggle against commercial forest conservation in Kenya ; the Kuy people in their opposition to economic land concessions in Cambodia ; the Ogoni in their battle against oil conglomerates in Nigeria ; the Cordillera and Lumad people in their resistance to mining and other destructive projects in the Philippines ; the diverse Indigenous groups in the Amazon rainforest in their fight against harmful agribusiness in Brazil ; and many other courageous struggles of Indigenous peoples to defend their rights , preserve their communities , and protect our planet . <p> Land and resource grabbing that deprive Indigenous Peoples of their rights and dignity are often disguised as initiatives to ' transform ' food systems in response to global crises of hunger , climate change , biodiversity loss , and pollution . These schemes -- cloaked in the rhetoric of ' conservation , ' ' green transition , ' or ' feeding the world ' --are fundamentally designed to extract profits from land and labor . In reality , they undermine food sovereignty and violate Indigenous Peoples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriation through ' special economic zones ' and ' growth corridors ' in the context of expanding bilateral trade and investment agreements <p> ' Carbon removal ' or carbon offsetting initiatives , for which governments have allocated 1.2 billion hectares of land globally <p> Such projects and schemes prioritize corporate interests over community needs , leading to displacement , environmental degradation and the erosion of traditional knowledge systems . Indigenous land management practices have sustainably preserved ecosystems for millennia . By disregarding Indigenous rights and wisdom , and wrestling away their control over ancestral lands , these initiatives not only fail to address the root causes of global crises but often exacerbate them . <p> Furthermore , these projects are frequently accompanied by human rights violations ( HRVs ) . In 2023 , PAN Asia Pacific 's Land and Rights Watch recorded at least 94 land-related HRVs against Indigenous Peoples , including killings , arrests and other forms of harassment . In one case , a Temb ? indigenous woman from Brazil was shot in the neck while filming the attacks perpetrated by guards of palm oil producer Brazil Biofuels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cardamom REDD+ project managed by the government and a big conservation NGO , around 16,000 indigenous villagers are facing displacement , arrests , and harassment -- their crops destroyed , their huts and fields burned down . <p> We condemn the escalating dispossession and violence against Indigenous Peoples , while billions of dollars are being channeled to supposedly address global crises and accelerate the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals . Even the Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) has acknowledged that " Despite the wide recognition that Indigenous Peoples are indispensable partners for reaching the targets of the Paris Agreement , the Global Biodiversity Framework and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development , the corresponding funding strategies do not necessarily reflect their crucial role , " pointing out that of the USD 1.7 billion pledged in COP26 to advance tenure rights and forest guardianship of Indigenous Peoples , only 7% went directly to their communities and organizations . Worse , these funds are often used to facilitate the implementation of market-oriented and profit-motivated climate schemes such as carbon markets that tend to displace or dispose Indigenous communities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indigenous communities in addressing global environmental challenges and shaping our food systems . We expect more of the same marginalization and tokenism of Indigenous Peoples at the UN 's upcoming Summit of the Future , whose techno-centric and neoliberal agenda is being shaped by big corporations and imperialist forces . <p> True transformation of our food systems should prioritize local control over resources , agroecological practices , and respect for the interconnectedness of land , culture , community , and people 's food sovereignty . It should support the Indigenous Peoples ' right to self-determination , including their right to freely determine their political status and pursue their economic , social , and cultural development . For this to be achieved , food systems should first and foremost be liberated from all forms of imperialist exploitation and control . <p> The future of Indigenous Peoples will not be secured through a Pact for the Future designed by their historical colonizers and oppressors .

@@112240230 <h> Everything I Learned Aboard Luxury Ship Regent Seven Seas Grandeur <p> Not many people get the chance to experience their first cruise aboard the Regent Seven Seas Grandeur , which is one of six Regent Seven Seas ships in " The World 's Most Luxurious Fleet " , but Johanna Thornton did just that with a 10-day cruise from Venice , Italy to Athens , Greece , cruising thestunning Mediterranean and Ionian Sea . <p> Seven Seas Grandeur is Regent 's newest ship , launched in November 2023 , with a reputation for exceptional service , luxurious suites , excellent dining , and all-inclusive offerings . There was a lot to discover about the art of cruising on this once-in-a-lifetime trip , which departed from Venice , Italy and sailed to some of Europe 's most stunning destinations , like Santorini and Istanbul . Here are some learnings . <p> It pays to get the terminology correct <p> Port , starboard , aft , bow . Nautical terminology is par for the course on a cruise and I made my first faux pas before I 'd even boarded Regent Seven Seas Grandeur , telling fellow passengers how excited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited on the dock in Venice . " It 's a ship , not a boat . Ships carry boats , " a fellow cruiser quickly corrected me . " That 's something you want to get right before you board . " As someone aiming to look like I belonged on a luxury cruise , I deleted boat from my vocabulary . <p> Your suite wo n't be ready when you do get on board <p> Cruise ships run a strict schedule , and often the day of boarding for new guests is the day of departure for the previous . Staff need time to turn around the suites and for most guests arriving on the day of departure , it 'll mean a welcome Champagne ( or two or three ) and lunch at La Veranda restaurant on the pool deck . This is hardly a chore , and only adds to the excitement of the room reveals later in the afternoon , which is broadcast over the ship 's speaker system from the captain 's deck . <p> The Regent Suite 's generous master bedroom . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Yes , 413 . Of the 15 suite categories on board , the Regent Suite is the ship 's largest and grandest . It features two bedrooms ( plus a separate guest bedroom and bathroom , for staff , one would assume ) , a spacious living room with a separate sitting and dining area , three walk-in closets ( three ! ) and two marble and stone bathrooms . There 's also an in-room spa with a sauna , steam room and unlimited access to spa treatments . <p> Exceptionally elegant , the Regent Suite 's living room rivals the world 's best luxury hotels with only the best furnishings , artwork and accessories . The wrap-around balcony overlooks the bow and there 's even a glass-enclosed parlour that allows you to enjoy the view but escape the sea breeze . The price tag for this ultra-luxurious suite ( $NZ18,000 NZD per night ) includes a butler , a driver for personalised shore excursions , and daily canapes and caviar . <h> Advertisement <p> My suite , the Superior Suite , is 38sq m , which is bigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Veuve in a Champagne bucket , chocolate-dipped strawberries on a silver tray , and the minibar stocked with cold drinks . <p> The suite is comfortable , with a sitting area that closes off from the bed with floor-to-ceiling curtains and a private balcony with room for two lounge chairs . I 'm sharing a suite with my mum , and our sleeping arrangements are two beautifully made king singles , with individual nightstands and reading lights , and room to store our luggage underneath . We 'd later marvel at the exceptional quality of the 1000 thread-count , Egyptian cotton sheets , which are so famous on board they 're available for guests to buy . In the marble-accented bathroom , there are two sinks , a full-size marble bath and a generous rain shower The complimentary toiletries are L'Occitane , replenished daily , and the towels are oversized , white and fluffy . The best part ? A handsome dark wood walk-in wardrobe with all the space you could ever need . <p> The Superior Suite , which has a sitting area and a spacious private balcony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordering whatever I wanted at breakfast , lunch and dinner and then just walking out without paying . It 's an exhilarating feeling knowing that nothing on the menu is off limits but we did n't go overboard when it came to ordering , except for always saying yes to dessert . I 've heard of people ordering one of everything just because they can on cruises , but on Regent the clientele are used to the good life and I do n't spot many tables heaving with lobster and caviar . Although you 're more than welcome to order extra lobster to add to your lobster bisque , which I saw one diner do . <p> At The Observation Lounge cocktail bar , you can join friends for pre-dinner drinks and no one has to handle the bill afterwards . It makes socialising a breeze and lowers the stakes of asking someone to join you for dinner when no one has to pay . This experience does ruin you for real life and there 's no greater reality check than the price of a mediocre coffee at Dubai airport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the shape of a gardenia . <p> You can have your minibar stocked with anything you like <h> Advertisement <p> As part of the ship 's all-inclusive offering , the mini bar is stocked with an ever-replenished selection of beverages of your choice . Do you want a fresh bottle of chardonnay added every day ? Coke ? Sparkling water ? We found we barely used our minibar with the abundance of food and drink offerings on board the ship . We looked forward to our pre-dinner cocktails in the Observation Lounge or from the Pool Deck bar to enjoy poolside . <p> There are no tea or coffee facilities available in your room <p> " There 's no coffee machine in our room ? " I exclaimed to Mum on arrival . " This is not going to work . " The absence of a tea and coffee station is n't an oversight , it 's a safety issue because having appliances plugged in is a fire hazard . Staff on board unplug lamps , hair dryers and chargers as part of their cleaning and turn downs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can either order it via room service or head to Coffee Connection on level five , where barista-made coffee is on offer , as well as a selection of light refreshments like pastries , toast , fruit , yoghurt and muesli . There 's also high tea in the Meridian Lounge available from 4pm . <p> There is a dress code and it does get enforced <p> In the evenings the dress code is " elegant casual " which means a skirt , or trousers with a blouse or sweater , a pantsuit or dress for women , and for men it 's trousers and a collared shirt ; a sports jacket is optional and ties are not required . Jeans are not permitted , which was a curveball for a lover of great denim . Diners on board definitely make an effort with their dinner attire , especially for the speciality restaurants and dressing for dinner became a highlight of the day for Mum and me . We sailed through a wardrobe of dresses , silk shirts , tailored trousers , blazers and high heels and never felt overdressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enforced too : a friend I made onboard was in one of the cocktail lounges when the clock struck 6pm and was politely asked to vacate because she was wearing her excursion outfit of activewear and sneakers after the allocated time . <p> The dazzling Compass Rose restaurant , designed by Studio Dado . <p> The food is excellent <p> There are seven dining options on board , including five specialty restaurants , and many ship conversations centre around the night 's dinner reservation . <p> If any space represents the high-octane glamour of Regent Seven Seas Grandeur , it 's Compass Rose , the ship 's largest speciality restaurant and a reliable option for lunch or dinner any day of the journey . Bookings are n't necessary here and it easily accommodates larger groups , meaning it 's the restaurant of choice for spontaneous dinners with new friends . The wow factor starts at the entry with a sculptural glass and metal waterfall cascading behind the host stand . Inside the dining room , there 's a canopy of crystal-covered " trees " that glow with light , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It reminded me of Gothic-style vaulted ceilings inside European churches with grand curved pillars . At Compass Rose , Calcutta marble glitters with a gold vein and crystal-shaped leaves adorn the walls . It 's a sensory overload that extends to the Versace tableware and crystal glassware . <p> To eat , you can build your dish by choosing from a range of proteins like lobster tail , whole Dover sole , New Zealand lamb chops and Black Angus fillet mignon , adding a sauce ( garlic butter , madeira-truffle , green peppercorn to name a few ) and a side ( lyonnaise potatoes , asparagus or buttered vegetables ) . You can also choose from the menu of appetisers and chef 's specials or let the executive chef choose with the degustation menu . <p> Pacific Rim restaurant . <p> Pacific Rim is a standout , the ship 's pan-Asian restaurant offering refined plates of sashimi , pork and shrimp shui mai , duck confit adobo , miso black cod and sticky Chinese barbecue ribs . Like each of the speciality restaurants , Pacific Rim has a unique look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold and green and greeting you with one of the ship 's showstopping sculptures , a life-size bonsai cherry tree by Savoy Studios made from bronze and hand-cut glass . Pacific Rim books out quickly so be sure to pre-book before you get on board . <p> Mum and I had a great night at Prime 7 , the interior of which is inspired by a New York City steakhouse with a menu of speciality beef cuts , seafood and iconic starters like jumbo shrimp cocktail and caesar salad . If those dinner options sound run of the mill , the design of the restaurant is anything but . Thinkglamorous red leather wingback chairs , custom-made onyx and belted leather chandeliers , bevelled glass surfaces , and stitched leather detailing in the ceilings and curved pillars , and even Persian rugs at the rear of the ship . <p> At Chartreuse , the menu is classic French and the dishes are truly beautiful -- possibly the most dazzling on the ship , so have your phone ready .

More is more , baby ! <p> There are n't many theatres this fabulous in New Zealand . <p> There 's entertainment every night <p> There 's a lot to keep you busy on board . From swimming in the pool or lounging in the spa ( or just relaxing on the pool deck ) , to a round of mini golf or pickleball on the top deck , a workout in the gym , trivia and cards in the Card Room , shopping at the ship 's luxury boutiques or booking in for a cooking class . There 's also after-dinner entertainment every night at Constellation Theatre , from music to dance and stand up comedy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seats and chic banquets . If music and dance are your thing , Regent 's own The Grandeur Production Company performs four Broadway-style shows including Pasion , a celebration of the Tango . I went to UK comedian Steven Stevens ' set with a martini in hand and had some good laughs before his show descended into elderly humour and musical theatre , but the audience loved it . The theatre also screens movie nights , playing blockbuster movies like The Beekeeper on the big screen and handing out popcorn . <p> Seven Seas Grandeur spa entrance . <p> There 's a spa on board , and it 's very luxe <p> The Serene Spa &amp; Wellness Centre has one of the most impressive entryways I 've ever seen , with a marble-lined walkway illuminated with glowing lamps . The spa has exquisite studios for hair and nail treatments and private treatment rooms offering massage , facials and body wraps . There 's also a gym with a daily fitness schedule of Pilates , HIIT , stretching and more . Outside on the stern , a spa and pool are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in motion . You can also enjoy an infrared sauna , cold room and steam room . <p> There are free shore excursions at every port , which you can and should book in advance , as the best ones fill up quickly . These range from guided tours to boat rides , wine tastings to city walks , with tour buses parked on the dock ready to transport you to some of the wonders of the world . We loved the guided tour of Ancient Ephesus in Izmir , Turkey , a Unesco world heritage site that has preserved this ancient Roman city and uncovered architectural gems like the terraced houses , which were the palatial houses of the wealthy constructed during the 1st century AD . <p> In Montenegro , we toured another Unesco site , the Old Town of Kotor , a medieval city enclosed by 20m-high walls and toured inside the monumental Venetian-style Church of Our Lady 's Temple , which took 120 years to build ( 1789 -- 1909 ) . While the Old Town was stunning , a highlight of the cruise was sailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by mountainous peaks and the bluest sea , like Montenegro 's answer to Queenstown . <p> Regent Seven Seas Grandeur at sea . Photo / Pete Barrett <p> Exploring each port is great , but you 'll grow to love getting back on board at the end of the day <p> At the start of the cruise , I was concerned about the amount of time we 'd be spending on board the ship . Our journey was taking us to amazing places like Santorini in Greece , Kotor in the magical country of Montenegro , and Istanbul in Turkey and I wanted to spend every minute I could soaking up the experiences on shore . But , to my surprise , I began to look forward to returning " home " to the ship . <p> This crystalised on an incredibly hot day in tourist-filled Santorini , where the cobblestone alleyways were so full of people it was a 40-minute wait to see Oia 's famous blue-roofed St Anastasi church and two hours to queue for the cable cars that would transport us down the hill to the ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the harbour , looked like an oasis from the busyness of Oia . <p> A blue-shuttered house in Oia , Santorini .

Having everything taken care of , including dinner later that night , is like coming home to a dream . It 's a feeling you can get used to far too quickly . <p> The library .

The library has an honesty policy , meaning you can take whatever you like to read and bring it back when you 're done . I noted all the latest and greatest best-selling reads , including Eleanor Catton 's Birnam Wood , as well as a solid selection of travel books to plan the next trip of a lifetime . The handsome wooden reading table was popular with guests , containing all the day 's papers from The New York Times to The Guardian . <p> You can have your laundry done for free -- every day <p> The joy of returning to your suite after a long excursion to find your laundry freshly washed and pressed and waiting for you on a hanger , and your undergarments and socks pressed , folded and wrapped in tissue paper inside a Regent box on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to real life very hard ; if only I could leave a bag full of laundry on my door at home and have it returned in impeccable condition and ready to wear to dinner and drinks that night . <p> The dazzling atrium with a 12m tapestry by Brazilian artist Walter Goldfarb . <p> Regent has millions of dollars worth of art on board <p> The art collection on board is so dazzling that you get used to walking past Picassos on your way to dinner . There are 1600 pieces of art on board , including three Picassos -- Toros y Toreros ; Antes de picar al toro and Picador picando al toro , con matador al quite -- and a very expensive Faberge Egg , Journey in Jewels , displayed inside a glass case near the executive concierge desk .

A white cotton T-shirt should always be turned inside out . <p> Treatment <p> The problem with white clothes is that any stains will always be a visible eye-sore , so it 's best to treat them as soon as possible . Start with cold-water blotting if fresh , and then move to a stain remover or a paste made from baking soda and water . Never use hot water on a stain . If the stains are intense , try soaking overnight in a solution of baking soda and water before transferring to the washing machine . <h> Advertisement <p> Use the hottest temperature water that is safest for your T-shirt according to the care label .

While there are the usual suspects on the market like Vanish and Oxi Clean , I 've recently been using biodegradable and environmentally friendly options such as Global Soap whitening powder , which leave no harmful by-products or residues . Another great alternative is the Earthwise Oxygenated Whitener with lavender and eucalyptus essential oils , a more natural whitener that keeps my T-shirts looking fresh and bright and free from phosphate , nitrate , chlorine and ammonia . <p> Drying time <p> I like to air-dry my white T-shirts in sunlight and once dry , throw them in the dryer on low heat for about 30 minutes . Using high heat can over-dry your garments , causing them to go yellow or fade .

There are several great T-shirt options with well-placed necklines that skim the collarbone , or if you 're feeling a little more experimental , high-neckline T-shirts are great way to combine the appeal of a T-shirt and a simple top . When layered underneath a blazer for example , a higher neckline on a T-shirt looks a lot more polished , which is great when you need to quickly segue between dress codes without any fuss . <p> Density : The best T-shirts have a decent weight to them , so it feels too flimsy , do n't bother .

Today , food spoilage is detected by very time-consuming bacteriological analysis . A team from Skoltech , the Kharkevich Institute for Information Transmission Problems of RAS and other leading research organisations has proposed a new method based on electronic nose and computer vision technologies for faster and more accurate assessment of meat quality . The study was published in Analytica Chimica Acta . <p> Skoltech researchers have been developing and using the e-nose technology in various fields for several years .

In our tests with supermarket meat , we saw little change in freshness and quality , while the meat we bought at the market went bad faster . It turned out that it already had different bacteria . At some point , most of the bacteria start to die , and only the most resistant spoilage bacteria stay alive and multiply . We used the e-nose to see how the odor of the bacteria-populated meat sample changed over time and then applied mathematical protocols to identify the transition point between freshness and spoilage , " said Fedor Fedorov , the study 's co-supervisor and co-author and an assistant professor at the Skoltech Photonics Center . <p> The team ran experiments at different humidity levels and identified the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was the sensor that responded to hydrogen .

@@112494238 <h> Tactical Paranoia : Peter Dutton 's Palestinian Problem <p> The philosophy of the dunce , and the politics of the demagogue , often keep company . And Peter Dutton has both of these unenviable traits in spades . The Australian opposition leader , smelling weakness in his opponent , Prime Minister Anthony Albanese , has again gravitated to something he is most comfortable worth : terrifying the kaka out of the Australian public . <p> The method of doing so is always unimaginatively dull and almost always inaccurate . Select your marginal group in society . Elevate it as a threat , filling it with a gaseous , nasty fantasy . Condemn said group for various fictional and misattributed defects . When all is done , demonise its members and tar any alleged supporters or collaborators as foolish at best , unpatriotic at worst . <p> The group of late to rankle Dutton and his front bench of security hysterics are Palestinians , notably those fleeing the odious war in Gaza and seeking sanctuary in Australia . Since the October 7 Hamas attacks on Israel , only 2,922 visas have been granted to those possessing Palestinian Authority travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger total of 7,111 visa applications have been refused by the federal government . So far , a mere 1,300 of them have made it to Australia , placed on temporary visitor visas that do not enable the holders to receive government aid or engage in meaningful employment . The Albanese government is ruminating on whether to create a new category of visa that would lift such impediments . <p> On such figures , Dutton has little to work with . Undeterred , he has spent the best part of a week playing the role of the tactically paranoid . " If people are coming in from that war zone and we 're uncertain about their identity or allegiances , " he told Sky News on August 14 , it was " not prudent " to let them in . <p> Education Minister Jason Clare , who represents an electorate in Western Sydney with a sizeable Muslim population , mockingly invited Dutton to pay a visit . " There are people from Gaza here now , they live in my electorate , I 've met them , great people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their schools blown up , their hospitals blown up , who have had their kids blown up . " <p> The Shadow Home Secretary James Paterson has also drummed up the concern that the government has simply not convinced " us and the Australian people that the security and identity checks that they 're doing are sufficiently thorough and robust to protect the Australian people " . While Australia had an " important role to play " in confronting " a very serious need , " safety and security of the Australian populace came first . <p> What constitutes a satisfactory measure for Paterson ? A blanket refusal to grant visas to any supporters of Hamas would be a start . " We are several days now into this debate , and they still have not clearly said whether they will or whether they wo n't accept someone who is a supporter of Hamas into our country . " All applications from Palestinians fleeing Gaza had to be referred to the domestic intelligence service , ASIO and " robust in-person interviews and biometric tests " conducted . <p> In comments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true intention of this dash into demagogy 's thicket . " Governments make choices all the time about who they prioritise to bring to Australia . If the Albanese government picks this cohort ahead of others it will be a revealing choice . " <p> These objections have an air of stifling unreality to them . For one thing , they are scornful of the views of Mike Burgess , the current ASIO director general , who , on August 11 , stated that " there are security checks " or " criteria by which people are referred to my service for review and when they are , we deal with that effectively . " <p> Burgess , showing uncharacteristic nuance , drew a distinction between the provision of financial or material aid to the organisation , something which might tickle the interest of a screening officer , and that of " rhetorical support " . " If it 's just rhetorical support , and they do n't have an ideology or support for a violent extremism ideology , then that 's not a problem . " <p> The logic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supporting link with Hamas shows a dunce 's principle at work . It falsely imputes that the individual is a potential terrorist , eschewing any broader understanding . Immature and unworldly , such a perspective ignores the blood-spattered political realities of the conflict . The insinuation here is that the only acceptable Palestinian is an apolitical one mutely acknowledging the primacy of Israel power , humble in expressing any claims to self-determination . <p> The Coalition opposition to granting visas to Palestinians voicing support for Hamas is also implausible in another respect . While claiming to be defenders of that most weaselly of terms , " social cohesion " , Dutton and his stormtroopers seek to demolish it . Manufacturing insecurity , much like the mafia 's credo , becomes the pretext for battling it . <p> Boiled down to its essentials , the views of Dutton and his colleagues , wholly picked from the cabinet of Israel 's security narrative , is that any support for Palestinian autonomy and independence , manifested through any political or military arm , must be suspect . You had to be , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-determination " and an opponent of " using violent means " .

That 's " up to 186,000 or even more deaths " , according to the Lancet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an untraceable virus or a natural disaster , but in a merciless war that can only be sustained through massive shipments of arms , which continue to flow to Israel despite the international outcry . <p> On January 26 , the International Court of Justice resolved that it had enough evidence to suggest that genocide was being committed in Gaza . On May 20 , Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court , Karim Khan , added his voice , this time speaking of deliberate acts of " extermination " of Palestinians . <p> Yet , weapons continued to flow , mostly coming from western government . The main source of weapons is , unsurprisingly , the United States , followed by Germany , Italy and Britain . <p> Despite announcements by some European countries that they are curtailing or even freezing their weapons supplies to Israel , these governments continue to find legal caveats to delay the outright ban .

@@112563231 <p> Social Development Minister Louise Upston announced Whaikaha would lose responsibility for delivering support services and the ministry would become a stand-alone organisation , no longer sharing back-office functions with the Ministry of Social Development ( MSD ) . <p> This decision followed a critical review which said the ministry had inadequate budget controls and was not set up effectively to manage the scale and nature of its funding . <p> Dr Huhana Hickey , a Maori lawyer and disability advocate , said there were some good elements in the changes in terms of making the policy element stronger , but transferring the funding over was a worry . <p> She said there was currently no one in Parliament who represented tangata whaikaha , which was why the ministry was set up " to influence policy and law " . <p> During a media briefing on Thursday , Upston said no policy decisions would be made overnight and the disability community would need to be involved . <p> " Their voice and insights will be so important in getting this right .

But by the time we reach the age of 40 , 67% of Maori have disabilities . " <p> In a statement , Upston said the shift of support service delivery to MSD was " significant but necessary " , and said MSD had the controls and capability in place to manage its funding . <p> " This will also solve the conflict of the Ministry of Disabled People - Whaikaha having both advocacy and service provision roles , making it a representative and powerful voice in Government for disabled New Zealanders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kaupapa Maori services , and while everyone should have the right to decide how their care should be , having the ability to have a cultural lens on their support was " hugely important " . <p> " And for me , I want it to be run with a kaupapa Maori approach , and there 's no two ways about that . " <p> Hickey said Maori and Pasifika whanau could end up " slipping up away again " with the restructuring of Whaikaha and lack of funding . <p> " We were getting more Maori and Pasifika actually engaging and getting support .

@@112567230 <p> Deputy governor Christian Hawkesby said loan-to-value restrictions had protected most households from falling into negative equity . <p> Deputy Governor Christian Hawkesby says the Reserve Bank 's ( RBNZ ) Monetary Policy Committee might have taken a different stance in May if the economic activity forecasts had been more accurate . <p> In May , RBNZ 's forecasts had anticipated 1% GDP growth for the calendar year . But by August , that had been revised to a 0.4% contraction , with a deep decline in the June quarter . <p> The RBNZ chose to cut the Official Cash Rate from 5.50% to 5.25% last Wednesday partly in response to these lower economic activity forecasts . <p> Another key factor was that businesses have been adjusting their wage and price-setting behaviour more quickly than anticipated in response to the low inflation environment . <p> Speaking in the latest episode of interest.co.nz 's Of Interest podcast , Hawkesby said the committee would not have adopted such a hawkish stance if these data points had been available during the May meeting . <p> " The uncertainty was around the speed and intensity that tight policy would be felt in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of evidence on the downside playing out " . <p> Uncertain <p> He said the OCR projection , published in that Monetary Policy Statement , was " flat with a slight upward bias " but with " big uncertainties " that were outlined in the record of meeting . <p> However , weaker than forecast GDP was not cited as a risk in the May meeting record , and uncertainty about price-setting behaviour was described as an upside risk . The committee agreed that interest rates need to " remain at a restrictive level for a sustained period . " <p> The chapter on economic projections included a disclaimer that said there was " significant uncertainty " about the assumptions used in the baseline forecasts . But the possibility of easing rates in the near future was not mentioned in the 60-page document . <p> This shift led some economists to describe the August decision as a ' U-turn . ' But there was consensus that it was the correct move , given the clear signs of a weakening economy . <p> Stay off the track <p> Hawkesby also said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank was going to keep the OCR at 5.50% until it saw inflation below 3% . <p> " You need to work on the basis that monetary policy is going to work . You do n't have to wait until the number is within the band , you just have to have confidence it will settle there . " <p> However , the May monetary policy statement projected the OCR would remain above 5.50% until September 2025 , by which time inflation would have been below 3% for a full year . <p> This was true in the February 2024 and November 2023 monetary policy statements as well . <p> Hawkesby said the OCR track that published in each statement often gets overanalyzed , without enough recognition that it is based on a set of assumptions . <p> " There 's something quite peculiar that happens when someone sees a line on a chart , or they see a number in a table , it has this sense of being real and factual , " he said . <p> " My advice to people would be to focus more on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Remember we welcome robust , respectful and insightful debate . We do n't welcome abusive or defamatory comments and will de-register those repeatedly making such comments .

" <p> 2 ) mud slinging at their opposition to make themselves look good in the eyes of voters . <p> Luxon blamed the economic difficulties on the previous Labour government . <p> " Essentially , poor economic management and financial discipline created rampant domestic inflation and therefore rising interest rates , which have squeezed family and farm budgets . And that squeeze has driven the country into recession and our unemployment is understandably rising , " he said . <p> When bank lending on housing is 70% of total lending , housing is your economy . <p> As Cam suggests this may be problematic , if their are further bigger falls . A 10 year stagnation in house prices is a win here , if the RBNZ can engineer it , however I think rates and insurances etc will also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as many desire . Meanwhile the fiscal spending to achieve this would have to survive multiple election cycles , of people who are pissed off and going nowhere fast . Its a good fairy tale , but ignores game theory . <p> I agree and note we are now in two gap periods , first the gap between inflationery rate/Insurance/energy price increases and the effect on costs going forward , secondly the gap between a newly re fixed mortgage at a much higher rate and the effect of decreased discretionery spending . If this does n't result in a continuing recession of greater length and depth plus more unemployed then I will acknowledge the earth is flat and the moon is made of green cheese . <p> Correct . I OIA 'd the RBNZ model after the November 2023 MPS , which forecast decent growth through 2024 ( lol ) . This forecast was so obviously nonsense that I suspected they were relying on some fantastical assumptions . The rest of the contextual data in the MPS clearly signalled recession - as did the trends on the metrics that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , current account deficit etc ) . Obviously , RBNZ did n't share their model with me , but they did confirm that they do not consider forecasts for bank credit creation as a factor in their forward predictions . This tells you all you need to know - muppet models . They might even be relying on some loanable funds BS . Awful . <p> Blind Freddy could see that NZ inc was cooling rapidly in the lead up to that set of forecasts and the RBNZ completely blindsided the market ( apart from ANZ who have proven to be equally loony on their hike call ) . <p> Either Hawkesby and Silk are as bad as Orr , or they did n't have the minerals to stand up to him . Either way , not a good look . I 'm not against rates being higher for longer , but such an about face in forecasts in such a short period is not the work of a high-performing central bank . <p> So the MPC are failing at their job and blaming poor analysis and forecasting ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rockstar salaries and the analysts peanuts is n't working . Orr being on twice Powell 's pay should be a huge wtf moment for any taxpayer . <p> You 're on point about management bloat . There are 27 directors among 510 employees at RBNZ . In other words , one in ever 18 employees is a director , the kind of bloat which is unheard of in the real economy . <p> About half of the directors are in non-core roles such as DEI , info security and governance . <p> That 's a somewhat ignorant observation . Directors can be senior technical staff or long tenure staff - not necessarily management bloat . I would expect RBNZ to have a number of highly educated and trained ( PHD ) staff who are not " middle management " people leaders but seneior subject matter experts . <p> A factor previously not in play is fear by the Pollies Elites and Bankers of what reaction by a population being unable to eat/work and have a roof over their heads . Looking at the widespread protests and riots - Ireland ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of Europe , so better to reduce interest rates and prevent mortgagee sales and a potential Bank crisis and they note the sucessful assassination of European PMs and the Unsucessful attempt on Trump and fear the idea may spread . The problem its too little too late to fix years of free flow migration of ethncis who refuse to integrate . When Govts /Police fail to solve a problem and attack the citizens whilst allowing other protests to riot on the people take over and then it gets very ugly . <p> The biggest issue was the ' uncertainty ' at that time in May . New government , tax cuts , slashing spending , etc. etc . <p> Rather than go back to ' first principals ' - as Jfoe , Renney and others do so well - they became blinded by ' maybes ' and just made stuff up , hedging foolishly at every turn . Classic ' groupthink ' . <p> What they should have done is what all good accountants and economists do - back check against previous similar scenarios and say , " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some huge change must have occurred ... But none has . We must be wrong . " <p> Shows you what echelon of society the RBNZers exist in - high up enough that they are blind to day to day reality . Those of us in the real world could/can all see demand dropping sharply , huge rises in unemployment all around us , large numbers of productive people leaving for better oppourtunities overseas as NZ decided austerity and eeking out a bit more from overloaded systems was possible . For instance at my work place ( building new tech systems for customers ) we have had about 20% of our workforce leave in the past 6 months - many due to cancelled projects by both private and public sector orgs who have decided to stop funding mostly urgent upgrades . Add to this cancelling infra projects and generally throwing babies out with bathwater and we have a huge economic hole , with lots of indicators its getting really bad for most with overloaded social/donation services ( KidsCann , foodbanks , church groups etc ) . <p> But RBNZers eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see any of that of course ? ( actually a mate said he saw Orr in the exclusive Wellington club when he was invited for drinks once , along with a bunch of other big wigs , so I guess they are insulated by not having to mix with most of us ? ) <p> The RB is continuing its mediocre performances &amp; is now blaming the slow &amp; poor third party data for their about-face . This chapter began in early 2020 but their mediocrity pre-dates this the August 2019 rate reduction comes to mind all on Mr Orr 's watch funnily enough . <p> On the issue of senior central govt remuneration in NZ - it has reached obese levels &amp; is sickening to read about , especially when compared to their so-called performances . Today 's 60,000 plus state employees deliver remarkably little value for the nation as a whole . You can see this in just about every govt departmental direction you care to look . Health , education , policing &amp; social spending are all currently sub-prime &amp; very obviously so . State housing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their title suggests . <p> My estimate is the quality of their output is closer to about half 50% of what they are currently compensated . And the higher you go the more it is so . <p> Do n't worry though , the RBNZ get to make their own report card and I am sure they will come out with " D minus , could do better " . No wait , last time they did this when they had screwed things up royally they gave themselves an A+ , what was I thinking . <p> 60000 state employees ? .. really , it must be nearly 500000+ , when you include teachers/ teacher aides , school administrator ( 125 k ) doctors , state paid specialists nurses , hca 's , hospital staff ( 150 k ) , and on it goes , , someone must have the numbers , is it one tax payer paid state salary for 5 private sector wages/ salary earners ? It 's vastly more bloated than 60 k departmental direct , staff .

All the mathematicians employed in the finance sector ( or , even worse , as economists ) . I could go on . We waste an incredible amount of energy and time on dumb stuff . <p> There are a few explanations for RBNZ appearing to be totally clueless . I suspect it is a combo of these three ... <p> Their models are based on macro theory that is so deeply flawed it should be thrown away ( loanable funds , savings drive investment , inflation expectations etc ) ... and they know it . They are therefore operating blind - waiting for the data to tell them what is going on , rather than taking action in advance .

The boys that cry wolf . <p> They need to maintain the illusion of having independent monetary policy - but the level of offshore savings in NZD / Govt Bonds means that they basically have to follow the Fed .

So you would think that supporting Stoller 's criticism of the landlord 's monopoly would be to help the economy , much as David Ricardo 's critique of the pro-landlord Ricardo Corn Laws in 1815 was aimed at making English industrial labor more competitive and not make industry flourish in other countries . Certainly . <p> When you think of those rental price increases , is affordable housing and the right to shelter the frontier to our freedom ? There 's not much affordable housing being built today .

Many LLs have been ' topping up ' their investment properties because their costs have been running ahead of their income .

As of June the actual rate of unemployment was 4.6% . <p> The latest forecasts from the RBNZ are a big about-turn by the central bank . <p> The previous set of forecasts issued by the RBNZ were in the extremely ' hawkish ' MPS issued in May . These forecasts had actually given a 60% chance of another HIKE in the OCR up from 5.5% to 5.75% , while cuts were not forecast till the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflation rate had not been forecast to get back into the targeted 1% to 3% range till the final quarter of this year . <p> Consensus reached <p> In the record of the meeting of the RBNZ 's Monetary Policy Committee , the RBNZ said the Committee observed that the balance of risks has progressively shifted since the May Monetary Policy Statement . <p> " With a broad range of indicators suggesting the economy is contracting faster than anticipated , the downside risks to output and employment that were highlighted in July have become more apparent . Members were also concerned about avoiding unnecessary near-term instability in output and employment given the evolution of recent indicators , " the RBNZ said . <p> The committee members noted that monetary policy " will need to remain restrictive for some time " to ensure that domestic inflationary pressures continue to dissipate . The RBNZ says committee members reached a consensus for the cut . <p> " The pace of further easing will thus be conditional on the Committee 's confidence that pricing behaviour is continuing to adapt to a low-inflation environment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Ahead of Wednesday 's announcements three of the big five banks , namely BNZ , ASB and Kiwibank , had been calling for an immediate cut . <p> Also ahead of the announcements , financial markets had been pricing in a two-thirds chance of a cut on Wednesday , with two cuts priced in by October and more than three cuts by the end of 2024 . <p> Economic growth remains below trend and inflation is declining across advanced economies . Some central banks have begun reducing policy interest rates .

Consumer price inflation in New Zealand is expected to remain near the target mid-point over the foreseeable future . <p> The Committee agreed to ease the level of monetary policy restraint by reducing the OCR to 5.25 percent . The pace of further easing will depend on the Committee 's confidence that pricing behaviour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflation expectations are anchored around the 2 percent target . <p> Summary of Monetary Policy Committee meeting : <p> The Monetary Policy Committee discussed recent economic and financial developments and their implications for monetary policy in New Zealand . <p> The Committee noted that the weakening in domestic economic activity observed in the July Monetary Policy Review has become more pronounced and broad-based . Headline inflation has declined , and business inflation expectations have returned to around 2 percent at medium- and longer-term horizons . Committee members agreed that monetary policy restraint can now begin to ease . The pace of loosening will depend on the extent to which price-setting behaviour continues to adapt to lower inflation and inflation expectations remain well anchored to the target mid-point . <p> Global growth remains below trend across advanced economies . Growth in China has been softer than expected , due to a depressed property market and weak consumer demand . While US growth has been firm , some indicators show emerging weakness . Recent volatility in global asset markets reflects nervousness about US economic prospects , geopolitical risks , and the outlook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global inflation has continued to decline but remains elevated in some parts of the services sector in many countries . The Committee noted that some central banks have recently begun cutting policy interest rates , reflecting lower core inflation , weaker activity , and softer labour markets . In this respect , New Zealand 's economic activity and near-term inflation indicators now resemble those in countries in which central banks have started cutting policy rates . <p> While official economic statistics have evolved in line with expectations in the May Monetary Policy Statement , a broad range of high-frequency indicators point to a material weakening in domestic economic activity in recent months . These include various survey measures of business activity , electronic card transactions , vehicle traffic , house sales , filled jobs , and job vacancies . These indicators collectively provide a consistent signal that the economy contracted in recent months . The output gap is now assessed to be more negative than was assumed in the May Monetary Policy Statement , indicating increased spare capacity . <p> The Committee discussed possible reasons for the current economic weakness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact of tighter fiscal policy could be constraining domestic demand . Falling net migration may also be playing a role . The Committee noted that measurement challenges , including methodological changes by Statistics New Zealand in the national accounts , are creating additional uncertainty around the composition and likely persistence of this weakness . <p> The Committee discussed recent developments in the labour market . The June quarter data suggest that employment growth has slowed , with declines in private sector jobs , hours worked , and wage growth . The impact of government spending restraint and public sector job losses are expected to materialise in further weakening in employment growth over coming quarters . <p> In discussing fiscal policy , the Committee noted that government expenditure is declining as a share of the economy , with contractionary impacts already felt and expected to continue . However , whether tax cuts will boost consumption is more uncertain . While tax cuts could stimulate demand , it is also possible that households might be more cautious about spending in the current economic environment . <p> The Committee discussed global and domestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to price in lower policy rates for the rest of the year , pushing down sovereign yields in most advanced economies . While domestic financial conditions remain restrictive , they have loosened over recent months . Market expectations for the forward path of the Official Cash Rate ( OCR ) have contributed to lower wholesale and borrowing rates , along with some depreciation in the nominal exchange rate . The Committee also noted that more households are choosing shorter pricing tenors , meaning that further reductions in mortgage interest rates will flow through to lower household interest costs relatively quickly . <p> The Committee noted that while credit remains available , demand for credit is weak . This provides a further signal of soft economic activity . High interest rates , sluggish housing market activity and low investment intentions have curbed demand for credit . The agriculture sector has also paid down debt , curbing credit demand . <p> The Committee considered risks to the financial system . With elevated debt servicing costs and weak economic conditions , some households and businesses are experiencing financial stress . The Committee noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased loan loss provisions and were well capitalised , making the financial system more resilient . Non-performing loans have increased from a year ago but remain relatively low by historical standards , and banks are well positioned to support borrowers . In this environment , the Committee agreed that there is no material trade-off between meeting its inflation objectives and maintaining financial system stability . <p> The Committee discussed inflation developments . Inflation fell considerably in the June quarter , due mostly to lower tradables inflation , while domestic inflation declined in line with expectations . Members were encouraged that surveyed business inflation expectations have returned to around 2 percent at medium- and longer-term horizons . All measures of core inflation have fallen and the components of CPI that are sensitive to monetary policy have declined further . Together with the weaker high-frequency indicators of economic activity , these developments provide the Committee with more confidence that headline inflation is returning to the target band in the September 2024 quarter . <p> The Committee discussed upside risks to the inflation outlook . The persistence of domestic inflation and the pace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain uncertain . Members noted the possibility that firms might adjust prices asymmetrically -- changing prices quickly when inflation was high and rising , but more slowly when inflation is falling . The Committee noted uncertainty around the outlook for potential output , given weak productivity growth . If potential output grows more slowly than currently assumed , there will be less spare capacity and less downward pressure on domestic inflation . <p> Furthermore , ongoing geopolitical and trade tensions and the global reshoring of manufacturing activities could lead to higher import prices for New Zealand . Members also discussed the significant rise in global shipping costs , caused by ongoing disruptions to Red Sea and Panama Canal freight routes . Given New Zealand 's relatively limited trade through these routes , the effect on shipping costs for New Zealand imports are assumed to be more moderate , and feed through to import prices with a lag . <p> The Committee discussed downside risks to the outlook . Members agreed that a weaker global economy , particularly in China , could dampen demand for New Zealand exports and reduce exporters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lower import prices . <p> Members also noted that domestic inflation could fall more quickly than projected if wage- and price-setting behaviour adjusts more rapidly to a low inflation environment . For example , headline inflation will fall sustainably back to the target mid-point more quickly if price and wage setters adjust more to expected future inflation rather than to past inflation . <p> The Committee discussed the reasons why inflation has been outside of the target range and the expected timeframe for inflation to return to the 2 percent target mid-point . Members noted the lingering effects on inflation from demand effects of monetary and fiscal stimulus , pandemic-related disruptions to supply , increased commodity prices and shipping costs from geopolitical tension , severe weather impacts on local food prices , and low productivity . <p> Conditional on the information available , the Committee felt that the OCR track in the projection reflected its view on the policy strategy that would best deliver on its remit . The Committee noted that monetary policy settings are consistent with annual headline CPI inflation remaining within the target band near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committee observed that the balance of risks has progressively shifted since the May Monetary Policy Statement . With a broad range of indicators suggesting the economy is contracting faster than anticipated , the downside risks to output and employment that were highlighted in July have become more apparent . Members were also concerned about avoiding unnecessary near-term instability in output and employment given the evolution of recent indicators . <p> In discussing the appropriate stance of monetary policy , the Committee noted that recent indicators give confidence that inflation will return sustainably to target within a reasonable time frame . With headline CPI inflation expected to return to the target band in the September quarter and growing excess capacity expected to support a continued decline in domestic inflation , the Committee agreed there was scope to temper the extent of monetary policy restraint . <p> However , members noted that monetary policy will need to remain restrictive for some time to ensure that domestic inflationary pressures continue to dissipate . The pace of further easing will thus be conditional on the Committee 's confidence that pricing behaviour is continuing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anchored around the 2 percent target . On Wednesday August 14 , the Committee reached a consensus to reduce the Official Cash Rate by 25 basis points to 5.25 percent . <p> Remember we welcome robust , respectful and insightful debate . We do n't welcome abusive or defamatory comments and will de-register those repeatedly making such comments . Our current comment policy is here . <p> Well the quality of public servants will drop even further . WFH is offered by most progressive and desirable workplaces . <p> Family member in AUS does 3 days in the Office , less if she wants . Was recently in NZ for 3 weeks to see us and WFH . And yes she worked alright , impressively enough to avoid a recent big round or redundancies . Aus corporate , not PS . <p> Agreed , WFH options opens up the job market to a greater audience due to the lifestyle it affords . I work alongside many women with young kids who are able to balance their days with pickups/dropoffs etc and they work harder than many others that are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I agree WFH allows so much more flexibility and productivity . I 'm usually on longer wfh than I am at the office and it will definitely help when my wife is back at work and we are juggling picking up the twins from daycare . <p> Easier to predict based on the person than what the decision should be . The decision should be to cut rates , that 's pretty obvious its only the RBNZ standing in the way . If they do n't officially cut rates , banks are doing it anyway so more cuts coming before September . The real question is why are we paying these people so much money when they are not really in control of anything ? <p> Not cherry picking , the date shows it was likely your most recent comment about the OCR and the words " ? f they do n't officially cut rates " reads like someone hedging their bets . It was a change of tune from your previous comments . <p> Well I was one . Can you blame people for not wanting to make predictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with RP and his multiple personality disorders trawling up your posts but never admitting you got it right . <p> Honestly , I was mentally preparing a " I was wrong post " for my call made 14 months ago that the first OCR cut would occur in August 2024 . Even though I stood by my call , after the May MPS , when RBNZ suggested a possible rise in the OCR , deep down I had doubts that Orr would be able to make such an about face . <p> I hedged my bets . I felt there would be a cut , but I figured Orr would be a dick about it so went " no change " as well . It 's taken him a while to read the room but at least he 's not completely oblivious . <p> The range is 1-3% , we should n't be avoiding the bottom half of that range . As an armchair economist there looks a far higher risk of us ending up out of that range than with no cut . Especially given higher electricity and gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> This is my thinking too . The risk of us ending up below 1% any time soon has got to be near zero considering the baked in non-tradable increases and demographic and infrastructure pressures . Whereas there are multiple plausible developments that could send inflation well over 3% again . <p> The RBNZ is now operating based on feels not forecasts . Every other central bank waited until inflation actually was at target before cutting . I guess Orr thinks he 's smarter than all those other bankers . <p> Canada , UK , Switzerland , Sweden and Europe all cut rates AFTER inflation was below 3% and within target band . US still waiting . But here we are with inflation still at 3.3% and its " lets cut rates NOW ! " Totally out of step with the rest of the world . <p> Do you see Norway or Australia cutting rates ? Nope , not until 2025 according to their central banks . Because inflation is still not in target range , or has only just moved in to the target range and they need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're ready to embrace the 1970 's again . Get out your flares and disco balls . <p> I am really surprised by this cut in August , as it shows quite clearly that the recent RBNZ 's own forecast of the interest rates trajectory was a complete joke , and as such it seriously calls in question Orr 's credibility . <p> I was fully expecting a total of 50 bps points cut before end of the year , but not in August - rather in October/November . <p> On the more positive side , it is good that the RBNZ is at least finally recognising the speed with which the NZ economy is deteriorating and taking action accordingly . <p> The future easing of monetary conditions should be done slowly and carefully though , otherwise the NZ$ will drop like a stone and we will have again an inflation problem with the consequent need for a re-tightening of monetary condition - something that the current NZ economy just ca n't afford . <p> A big cut - 0.5% or above - is a clear indication they 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year to make changes . Turning oil tankers needs small adjustments on the wheel way before you even get close to things that will sink you . <p> The only time such cuts should be necessary are for sudden , and serious , black swan events ... ( and IMNSHO covid did n't qualify , thus the OCR should never had gone much below the neutral rate of 2.5% . Covid was an issue for government and the RBNZ should have stood back . ) <p> Having only jumped into the property market in the last two weeks , you can now call me Chubby " The Oracle " Peterson . The most unproductive and insipid asset class in history which all of you idiots piled your hard earned overtaxed money . <p> Interesting , not all debt is bad .

If you enjoy driving then hell yes why not and its probably the last chance to buy a new performance ICE car with a 6 speed manual transmission . <p> Borrowing for property was fine until the Govt had a bright idea and introduced the OCR in the 90 's . Now it feels like mortgage debt is just a variable tax payment , turning home-owners into cash cows to stabilise the economy . <p> And of course the higher the debt , the more control Govt has over society . No wonder they have no real desire to reduce house prices . <p> with 900k plus on the clock had it 23plus yrs paid 23k for it just serviced mechanic says engine as good as new .

Cant get then easy now due to age and the Saudis have been paying megabucks for the engines alone as they recognised the reliability . More money to scrap one now which gets sold off to saudi than it is to fix . <p> @averageman I said I needed 5.5 retail banks by March to survive ? You said impossible with rates nearly 7% . I feel it is now probable ? I am sure you going to give me a blast however this time round you might not get all the likes you use to . <p> ' Members also noted that domestic inflation could fall more quickly than projected if wage- and price-setting behaviour adjusts more rapidly to a low inflation environment .

I suppose the main hope of the heavily indebted is that any downwards OCR movement reignites the fires of the ponzi . <p> Great news for those who have a lot of debt , including farm overdrafts . In saying that home loan rates might not change much if at all as the Banks expected this and reduced their rates ahead of today . Banks are not your friend . They give as little as possible and always win . <p> Still above the lows when the major economic news came out in late July . ( Pub-economists read far too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> If one subscribes to the view that a country 's currency is like a ' share ' or ' stock ' in that country , ( I largely do ) , then the NZD will break through those July lows as the economy continues to contract and the suffering mounts . Unless there is a significant improvement in our BoP , particularly our export receipts , it 's going to be one way traffic . <p> Fark 's sake Adrian , now I 'm going to have all the annoying agents from the various open homes I 've visited over the past month calling me up telling me to get in quick because the heat will be returning to the market . <p> I will personally seek vengeance if this occurs , or if an even worse scenario materialises in which I 'm forced to endure the in laws talking up their leveraged portfolio again ( I know it 's bleeding cash each month ) . <p> A friend of me said to me in the office today , " What do you think they will do ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why ? ' he said . <p> " Because they should n't " I answered . <p> And really that sums up the reserve bank . I really ca n't think of a single decision they have got right . If there was ever a time for keeping the powder dry it is now . With our current account deficit , the hit on the currency will be immediately inflationary . Never mind what happens in Ukraine and the middle east . <p> Remember the funding for lending program , also knowns as the big ' Ponzi Bubble Blow ' . Inflation created directly by the RBNZ <p> cosmetic cuts ... too little ... too late ... the damage is done . We have n't even seen all the lag effects yet . Keep an eye on unemployment and liquidations as the government is sitting on its hands not coming to the rescue <p> Yep the property market here turns on a dime because its so sentiment based . People now know that rates are going DOWN and are going to continue to go down so the pressure is off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the tunnel . <p> Absolutely nothing they 've said today that they could n't have said for the last two - or even three - MPSs . <p> Remembering of course that the May MPS - where they said rates may rise and the first cuts would n't be until Q3 next year - was utter b.s . Geez , they need to apologize to borrowers that fixed longer based on their nonsense . And I 'd support any borrower taking legal action against them for that May release . <p> They are just playing the market , and the market plays a similar game back . Had they said in May " we intend to cut in August " , then the market prices that into fixed rates that very day and the RBNZ has effectively cut when they did n't want to . <p> I think he played a pretty good hand really , he had almost all commentators here fooled into thinking there would be no cut today . <p> " In addition , the RBNZ has sharply moved down its inflation forecasts . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ targeted range in the current quarter . It sees annual inflation being 2.3% by the end of the September quarter . " - this was quite obvious a long time ago , there is a big 1.8% that falls out of the annual this quarter . <p> IMO this shows they have bowed into massive pressure from banks and politics . Inflation is not in the required band and they failed and let it get completely out of control once . I would have had more respect if they had kept it stable . Banks want to sell mortgages and get house prices rising again , so it was no surprise that they were strongly calling for the rates to be dropped . <p> Solely focusing on the vested interests of banks/politicians is stupid . They 've caused the damage they wanted and this is very evident by many metrics , including the massive worrying net outflows .. Holding for any longer and accounting for lag risks massively overshooting the mark . <p> This was the right call . They 've done enough as noted in the unanimous decision to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than expected and wanted to cut the OCR a small amount to see what effect it has on the inflation announcement in October . it will interesting see when they now think inflation will be at 2% surely that estimate has changed . <p> That is a massive U-turn from the RBNZ 's May MPS from " we may have to raise the OCR and the first cut will occur in more than a year 's time ( Q3 2025 ) to CUT NOW " . Somehow , they now seem to see what many on Interest have been seeing for some time . <p> A perspective perhaps not mentioned yet . Some of those I have talked to the last few years ( retired , mortgage free and with av $500k cash ) may now start cutting their spending as the return on their TDs drop . <p> They increase their spending in relation to interest rate rising as they got more return in their low risk investments . It possible that we now see a reduced spend from them in the economy as rates fall . <p> Sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( if they keep their jobs or do n't get reduced hours as recession bites ) but it does n't mean an improvement necessarily In conditions for your business/household . <p> If the post tax return on TDs approaches 0 -- % again , many retirees may close up their wallets as their income drops ( super + TD income ) - they do n't own rentals and they do n't want to risk the sharemarket so low rates do n't benefit them much if f at all . <p> But hopefully some relief for those with mortgages that have been battling away of late . <p> Quite funny how many kiwis are heading to Australia as things are ostensibly better , but the more you read the more you see the same problems or worse across the ditch . <p> Sydney becoming a city of no grandkids . Housing insane . Brisbane a big hot dump on a dirty river . Melbourne a big Wellington whose idea of cool is some drug addled graffit " lanes " with some wanker selling overpriced artisan coffee . And the rest just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures from Immigration NZ as they like economists predominantly get it wrong . Remeber back when they said 160k visa holders would get that one off visa 210k it turned out . For departures in May this year they said we lost so many kiwis turned out we actually gained 300 so pinch of salt any time a govt dept talks figures <p> The number of births does nt lie - European births in the year to March 2024 have dropped by 14% in just one year . Where have all those babies disappeared to ? ( Cant blame the pandemic either , Maori/Pacifica births are only down 4% , and Asian births are up 12% ) . There is a huge exodus of people underway and it will reverberate for generations . <p> Melbourne is in a deep depression , similar to NZ . But Brisbane is rocking . Go out in the city on a Monday , Tuesday night and the restaurants and bars are packed . Tons of people walking around the CBD shopping strip . Same on the Gold Coast . Same in Townsville ( where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over here - the old world , the way things used to be before people like Jacinda Ardern and Dan Andrews completely stuffed everything . <p> The body corporate fees on a luxury waterfront apartment on the Gold Coast is now the same as what I pay in rates to the Christchurch Council . So it probably wont be too long before I stop funding useless cycle lanes and 20 kmph speed humps on suburban streets . And I can drive around the Australian streets at 60 kmph and be astounded at how all the Australians still manage to survive ! <p> Yeah it 's definitely caught me off guard ... I was all locked in to chuck a heap of " ponzi " comments everywhere ... then boom it changed to " it 's tanked the dollar " ... l just ca n't keep up with the cool kids vocab damnit ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? <p> Agree with that . But if 0.5880 does break this time , 0.5714 looks like the next support , then something with a 0.50 to start with . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has in his intervention pop-gun . So that 's possibly all just improbable charting stuff ... ( we hope ! ) <p> Will be interesting probably slow cuts of 25bps at each meeting . The RBNZ are not going to want to swing hard the other way and will watch the FED . The US election is coming and the Dem 's are going to smash Trump , his time is up . <p> First point : Wiggling interest rates down by 25 pts will help businesses a bit . That 's $500m of debt servicing cost relief . You might even see a bit of that relief come through to lower prices , but I suspect that balance sheet repair will be the main focus . As it will be when rates come down again ( and again ) over the next year as RBNZ chase the economy down the swanny . <p> Second point : The real economy in NZ gets crushed by higher interest rates with a 12 - 24 month lag . Lower rates will release disposable income - but , again , this will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass on changes painfully slowly , and unavoidable prices are still going up ( hello rates ) . It is also REALLY important to note that economies do not recover without fiscal support , and the Govt in their infinite , ideological wiz-dumb are cutting deficit spending from around 5.3% of GDP in the year to June 2024 ( $21bn ) to 2.1% this Govt fiscal year ( $8bn ) . This reduction will be really contractionary ! A $13bn reduction in stimulus will remove a similar amount of stimulus as a 250pt rate hike . <p> Third point . Oh my bloody god ! Look how much the RBNZ economic forecasts have changed in a few months . They now more closely reflect the data and trends that have been obvious to anyone with an understanding of macro for a year . For example , RBNZ now see annual gdp growth being negative for a year or so . A few months ago they were forecasting a tiny dip into negative in June 24 and then onwards and upwards ( the fools ) . They 're also now forecasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra 20,000 people unemployed ? And , so on . <p> Yes Orr had to cut today as the economy has contracted . Businesses and families are struggling to survive financially . What a bloody mess . He should have cut earlier . There are no excuses . He has more data to work with than everyone . <p> Did n't they say just a few months ago that they would n't start cutting until later in 2025 . It is a pretty major turnaround imo , and it is n't a sudden shock or event like covid was , to make such a uturn . <p> Orr neither got us to 7% nor helped us get back to 3% ( or whatever ) . The global price level has adjusted , and our price level has followed . Why ? Because a third of our consumption by value is imported , and export prices determine the price of stuff we make domestically and consume here ( eg cheese ) . Take a look at this graph . What do you see ? <p> I reckon they were pissed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tanking . Now it 's on the coalition as they have cut as everyone was asking for . Now if things do n't pick up the focus will come on the coalition . There is only so long they will be able to blame Labour and RBNZ . Fun times . <p> I will not but the public will . I think broader structural forces are more responsible for how the economy does than any given administration . I think administration 's can nudge the economy more or less in the right or wrong direction but the major structural forces determine the overall positive or negative outcome . <p> Think of it like curling , structural forces throw the rock and each administration sweeps furiously to try to bring it towards themselves . <p> Although many are clutching at the straw of ( future ) reduced mortgage payments and expect a boost to discretionary spend and borrowing , this is an admission that things are not good and the only , repeat only option the RBNZ has is to reduce the cost to the economy of ' rent ' .... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yep somewhat agree , it is an admission and likely the RB will tread very carefully . Banks will be happy with todays announcement but should also be very wary of how far they push their luck with the RB . Times have changed and likely the RB is ready to spin on a dime if they have too . I view this drop as a goodwill gesture and those that bite the hand should be very careful ... The RB certainly has solid expectations . <p> 242 comments in 5 hours . A good indication of the incredible interest in today 's announcement and the financial pain out there in NZ homes and businesses . He spoke of the economy contracting . Why not make an exception to the rule and do it the minute he could see the economy was in deep trouble .

See the first graph below for the trend . <p> Work visa approvals are also lower on an annual basis , with 197,418 approved in the 12 months to July this year , down 33,048 ( -14.3% ) from 230,466 approved in the 12 months to July last year . <p> Work visa approvals peaked at 243,195 in the 12 months to July 2019 , and were above 200,000 a year for 2016 to 2019 July years . <p> However while the number of work visas being approved appears to be in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country is not . <p> According to MBIE there were 188,634 people in NZ on work visas at the end of July this year . <p> That 's within a whisker of the 190,263 here pre-Covid in July 2019 , and well ahead of the 168,105 in the country in July 2018 . <p> However their impact on NZ 's population is probably much greater than those numbers suggest . <p> The second chart below shows the number of people in NZ on work visas at the end of each month going back to 2008 . <p> This shows their numbers follow a very regular seasonal pattern and steadily increased from 2011 to early 2020 . <p> Numbers then began dropping away sharply in April 2020 , falling to a low point of 108,336 in September 2022 , and started rising steadily again from October 2022 . <p> Because that period coincided with Covid-related travel restrictions , it would be easy to think that was the main cause of the downturn in the number of work visa holders in the country . <p> But there was also another factor at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This scheme provided a fast track approvals process for people who had been in NZ on work visas for several years and wanted to apply for residence visas . <p> Applications for residence visas under the scheme have now closed and it is essentially being wound up as Immigration NZ processes the last stragglers - just 15 residence visa applications under the scheme were approved in July this year . <p> However between December 2021 and July 2024 , 211,335 residence visa applications were approved under the scheme . <p> This caused a massive decline in the number of work visa holders , as people transferred from a work visa to a residence visa , and a correspondingly massive increase in residence visa holders . <p> Between January 2021 and July 2024 the number of people in NZ on residence visas , as measured by MBIE 's truncated data , more than doubled , from 161,183 to 333,198 . <p> The effect of this is easily seen in the second and third graphs below , one showing a huge but temporary decline in the number of people in the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge surge in the number with residence visas . <p> Given that so many migrants to NZ originally arrived on work visas and later obtained residence visas , and that trend is likely to continue in the future but probably at a slower rate than was evident during 2022/23 , the impact overseas workers have on our population growth and therefore our economy , is almost certainly much greater than is suggested by the work visa data alone . <p> *You can have articles like this delivered directly to your inbox via our free Property Newsletter .

Our current comment policy is here . <h> 59 Comments <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suburbs is because the lack of interest deductibility artificially pumped the proportion of rentals that were new builds . Now that this has been reinstated older houses are available again . <p> With council rate hikes only just being realized , and high immigration , I fully expect rents will increase above the 3% pa target for the next couple of years <p> That is the answer to all things property ; " It 's what the tenant or aspiring gatherer of more Debt CAN pay that determines market price " . Whether that 's the amount of rent attractable or the amount of Debt assumable to buy/continue to own property . <p> Scrap the ability of new Debt to be reliant on a revaluation of present holdings when applying for more Debt , for instance , and just see how many loans CAN be taken out . Make any new loan reliant on cash-flow and not a revaluation of the collateral , and amateur property speculation will die on its knees . <p> That is simply not true . The 12 month rolling average for rent in May 2024 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing an increase . So yes . Rents are more than 3% higher than they were 12 months ago . <p> No , they are making a point that the price is dictated by the market 's ability to pay rather than the pricing decision of the landlord . Either way it 's a silly tangent . Assuming wages grow and immigration is here to stay , the long term trend is that rent prices will generally increase . <p> Hmmm , maybe . I can only see data back to 08. it will be more nuanced potentially than ' history repeats ' <p> most importantly what sectors are the dominant ones in terms of employment for people on work visas , and how vulnerable are those sectors economically ? <p> what is the sectoral composition of work visa employment now compared to say 07/08 ? For example , are there similar numbers of work visas in construction now compared to then ? My gut feeling is much higher now , therefore more vulnerable <p> But then if it did , that 'd also coincide with lower supply ( also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rent prices taking off ( i.e. 2-3 years of new house construction falloff overlaps with a jump in rents ) . <p> We are outsourcing a few jobs , for the first year the company puts the person on the ground in AKL , then off to India for the next 4 etc . High end coding jobs , but old languages . Replacing retiring workers , who will train the out source workers over their remaining 2-3 years . One will be in 70 's by then . <p> There is a lot of this going on across banking and insurance , mainly mainframe / core system / cobal etc etc <p> Will be adding to visa numbers ... these jobs will never come back , but at the same time young coders want to work CI/CD dev ops cloud not cobal <p> It 's funny how things change . For the past few decades , I 've built a website every 4 years or so . The first ones required coding in HTML , and the most recent one has required me to type in a paragraph , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tech makes for interesting employment dynamics , as IT GUY has inferred . Sort of like being able to tune a carburetor in the world of fuel injection ( or electrics ) . <p> This is something like saying " I built a backyard shed with prefab from Costco . The obsolescence of construction makes for interesting employment dynamics " . You have no idea how little you actually understand about the subject . <p> In reality , AI is almost useless for anything serious that would require employing immigrants to do . <p> Er so can scrapping the internet for other designs in less then a minute . Copy and paste of something else is not AI and it is not a time saver when critical site faults &amp; security holes are widely prevalent . <p> If you want a landing page site you do not need AI for that . Eyesight helps but equally blind people can still pick up a template easily enough in less then a couple minutes . AI is just a waste of energy for that purpose and it is not going to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fake . <p> Also protip design normally involves a lot more then just HTML ( only those completely clueless about the internet thinks HTML is what makes up a whole website even decades ago ; it is hilarious you skipped many steps which shows the kind of work &amp; level done ) . If you are not familiar with at least the 15 most popular languages used for site design you are already exposing yourself to more risks . But as a bonus if it is just a landing page site serving cheap fake content you copy pasted who really cares if it gets hacked . If it takes user data , sales , or provides services you are really in the shit for thinking AI is any level of solution ( especially when most the code AI uses is regurgitated answers from sites like stackoverflow , reddit etc ) . AI generators even when provided the exact solution in its training data have been proven to be less then half the time correct . Flip a coin on something you copy from online and it would be more accurate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laughs over AI generated garbage and fake site content for the tech &amp; engineering forums . The failures are so funny , and often costly for larger companies , the term " self inflicted " normally applies to those who use AI generators &amp; trust them . <p> It is hilarious that the standards of a toy fan forum setup by those completely inexperienced in tech ( for bronies ... it was a dark day lookup for friends after the movie &amp; the Andrew W.K interview ) is higher then your work . <p> No seriously this is good stuff . I am not sure is there a reverse version of Clients from Hell ? Cowboys from Hell perhaps . <p> Sure and then customer data ( where some customers are very large businesses and govt depts ) and identity theft can be much more prevalent in services that have mandates to follow NZ laws but fail to ensure data stays in a jurisdiction where those laws apply ... I think you will find they are already in breach of the NZ privacy act the second they can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign country and make allowances for the data sharing . <p> Protip if you think banking &amp; insurance can skip out on that whole customer data protection thing &amp; can have widespread negligence of the management of their IT contractors you better look again . Sadly we still allow that level of management incompetence allowing situations of massive data leaks locally in local &amp; national govt depts because the watchmen do n't watch themselves . <p> If so , can you point me at a job advert . Apart from being a wiz myself ( from DOS to MVS to iSeries to COBOL.Net on windows ) , I could tempt some other wizzes out of their indulgences . And yes , we 're all pretty fluent in most modern languages , OSs , networks and all things web , security , etc , etc . Kind of nerd mafia . ( btw COBOL.Net works just fine in a CI/CD dev ops cloud environment . We did one a few years back that is being slowly converted to more modern . Net languages when the need arises - which is less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not seen the COBOL ads kicking around . But then employment advertising by recruiters is even worse these days , considering most is copy pasted , a lot of the actual review work is cheap automation designed to fail , and not related to the actual work roles and the costs for running the ads borders more on subscription model . Much of the applications to jobs are also not even processed by humans so automated filtering failures are frequent ( the number that said they applied to a role but then recruiters incorrectly never sent applications through or even bothered responding to the applicants outside of a automated email ) . It got so bad often we ended up doing the review ourselves ( of hundreds of CVs ) which turned out cheaper then the recruiters and resulted in more successful qualified applicants . <p> The Spruikers all came to Spruik Barfoot failed auction numbers , and now they have to read immigration numbers , must be disappointing ... <p> I have noticed the real estate stats are no longer coming out at the same time each week etc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comments around them and try to change the narrative to " falling rates be quick " ... " the crash is behind us etc " <p> They never seem to comment on job seeker numbers perhaps its because a job seeker is not a marginal buyer . I know someone running a water bottling plant out Eastern BOP , its very hard to find good workers , who are reliable and can test drug free so they can work on plant . They pay above minimum wage . <p> I suspect the recently made unemployed will be off job seeker as soon as they can find a new job , they truely need the help <p> Maybe but I think the NZ Property Market has a huge number of head winds , and IMHO there may well be other markets that offer better returns , Gold for example is looking great . Remember BTC at $300 then $3000 , now ? Well gold is only 4k NZD , how many people do you know who own BTC ? How many who own investment in gold ? ( not rings etc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its owned by central banks as a hedge , that 's interesting is n't it . Once there are Gold Investment Facebook groups , it will be worth getting out . Its possible that gold may increase more in a month then in a lifetime ... but would it be about the collapse of fiat in which you are valuing it ? Best hedge ever <p> Yip you are at risk of being abused as an unintelligent ' gold bug ' if you admit you own gold ! ( but who cares .. ) . I moved a small amount of net worth to gold in 2019 when interest rates inverted and it 's been a decision I do n't regret . It 's been tracking away upwards while there 's been a lot of volatility in other assets ( including bonds ) . <p> investing in gold is not bad , but the storage &amp; selling of it can be very problematic . E.G. incidence of theft is higher then that for shares or cash investments but there is a physical barrier being someone would need to physically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bar is lowered and they can be low tech but they need physical proximity so the reach they have to targets is also lower . Key thing with gold investments is secrecy even to family and friends , but often may need a way to inform them should the need arise e.g. emergency or accident or death where the owner is impaired . Natural event disasters are also an issue for gold storage . Plan well and gold investments are fine . <p> Why do we need to label people as being either DGM or spruiker ? The vitriol and name calling adds nothing to the quality of the commentary on here . And trying to put people into one of these two mental categories means there is little ability to rationally reason , with an open mind , with peoples data/points of view . <p> ( if anyone in the future catches me using the terms , please call me out as a hypocrite ) . <p> Surely a DGMer is so negative they will never buy and and spruiker is so positive they cant buy anymore because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both naratives , I am sure that a DGMer will buy one day , and I am sure no spruiiker has enough to buy as often as they spruik <p> you can be a property bull but consider you are long enough here .... its ok to let a trade complete without constantly adding to it <p> Considering most jobseekers on the jobseeker benefit are disabled or also in carer roles that is no surprise . What you think NZ will fix its massive discrimination , systemic denial of employment to disabled people and have more accessible communities in 13 years ? We are already 30 years behind the US on that and 20 years behind Australia . People do n't find magical cures to help reduce the amount of systemic discrimination and employment denials they face when on incomes that do n't even provide subsistence living and need charities to provide support for food and transport on top . It is so obvious the jobseeker length of time numbers that those who use the stats provoke a bit more then a facepalm . <p> What the stats do show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employers who do not discriminate &amp; work that is accessible . The time on jobseeker is more of a NZ and us as a whole thing then the jobseekers themselves . Hence the " job seminars " are really just more consulatant time wasters looking to milk the taxpayer for nothing less then their own fraud and meaningless abuse of those on jobseeker benefits . The amount paid to the consultants running the seminars could have been paid to all the job seekers they " helped " for the same work with no difference in outcome . <p> Above minimum wage is not enough to live on . Imagine the wage necessary for housing , to support a family and pay for transport &amp; gear for work and unexpected living costs . I think you will find even $28 /hr is very low . But sure cram some migrants into a hostel or cheap unmaintained housing , claw back their wages through work costs , transport , penalties and then pat yourself on the back that you pay barely " above minimum wage " for what you expect is skilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their multigenerational family life savings just to live and get by in the roles . Ca n't reason why kiwis are not jumping for a chance at the overcrowded , financially costly and unhealthy lifestyles that migrants take up just long enough to get residency and then get out . <p> It 's unfortunate we have created a system where one of the biggest barriers to locals securing work is their knowledge of employment law and their refusal to work for below minimum wage . <p> When these migrants compete with Kiwis for jobs , Stanford held employers at fault for contributing to lacklustre statistics . " Just to give you an example , since April , under my new changes , the Ministry of Social Development has listed over 3000 roles via the Accredited Employer Work Visa associated listings , " said Stanford . " Of those , just over 50 have resulted in a New Zealander being employed . It 's less than two percent . " When employers did not consider hiring a migrant worker , that placement rate rose to 60 percent . <p> Stanford said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a given role , but called out " a significant number of employers " who predetermine a migrant for a position and do n't take the MSD requirements seriously . <p> " It 's not reasonable to me that someone can have 50 applicants from New Zealanders through MSD for a lower-skilled job and say that not a single person is appropriate for that role , " she said . <p> Knowledge of employment law should n't be something that counts against a potential employee , but Labours idiotic enthusiasm for creating a system where the foxes are in charge of the hen-house means it does . <p> Unfortunately , migrants with the critical skillset that we should retain move on to Australia . Think doctors , nurses , engineers , teachers , etc . <p> Those without such skills to offer ( hospo , tourism , retail workers , Uber drivers , etc. ) do n't have better career opportunities in Oz or further afield , so this lot ends up sticking around after citizenship . <p> In my opinion your reference does nt come anywhere near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Poverty and housing in NZ has reached Dahravi levels and downtown Auckland is Mogadishu ? <p> I grow increasingly frustrated with discussions swamped with examples wildly out of context with the situation . Normally I just delete my comments before posting but today I 'm a bit snippy . I maintain my " pffff " . <p> These days we often get the slaves to pay for that themselves . They sell up family assets , savings , investments , pay for the transport , illegal overcrowded housing &amp; food from those savings they had and end up penniless in a matter of a couple years in which you just rinse them out through illegal terminations , denial of work , denial of income and stop communication and repeat the process with a new bunch of hopefuls . Hence modern slavery well known in AEWV scheme and the endless hospo imports , where trafficking is so common . It is the natural progression that no longer do direct employers need to pay for the slaves *cough* migrants they can get them to pay for it and get outside contractors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be set up to bring in more and more migrants reaping large payouts from them , then they are farmed out . If one hire company gets a bad rep or could face legal action they just phoenix and move on to the next joke name . <p> NZ also did similar with the disability community in recent history so it is not like slavery is alien to us . We just formalized the process and reduced the costs to employers . <p> Hence Labours &amp; Greens be kind strategy over the past 6 years was to ramp up migrant exploitation in a big way , much like the enabling of overseas students to work so more degree mills got set up as another way to milk the system ( prior to the complete migrant exploitation as you like it AEWV scheme ) . <p> It was kind of them to think of the scammers &amp; fraudsters engaging in massive modern slavery rings . After all it is tough on the soul having to destroy the hopes and dreams of that many families . <p> There are a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of when using the terminology because of its prevalence in popular cinema &amp; the US ) . 1 . people are not considered property to be brought and sold ( hence they do n't need to be in chains ) 2. the process of acquiring slaves is more deception based , however there is still a lot of deception techniques used today that was shared with the slavery of Africans . <p> The slavery of Africans was widely prevalent worldwide and was moved to an industrial scale but it was also costly &amp; resulted in much loss of life , and strife . Hence the transition to self funded and self entrapped slavery as a way to get the slaves to pay for everything themselves and there are no rebellions , no wars , and you do n't need to pay for transit or massive living costs . You can entrap people much easier with financial theft &amp; control then you can with barriers &amp; chains because the people feel like they have to stay to enable their freedom and not the reverse . <p> It does use the simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of them feel like they have to stay e.g. gamblers fallacy , optimism &amp; survivorship bias , halo effect etc . You do n't need to raise slaves or bother with discipline , just get more people instead . They pay for it themselves , you collect most of their life savings from the outset so you get immediate financial benefit and if they bother you then you just drop contact with them and get a new one . No need for discipline and with the rinse and repeat method you can strip another person of life savings so it is a benefit just to drop people at will . You can even do this with arranged marriages so long as you are picking from a lower class to reduce risk of any response from the family . <p> In NZ we met the conditions for much closer definitions of classic slavery , then we just upgraded to modern slavery ( get the slaves to pay for their indentured servitude ) . We even now have prosecutions for slavery in NZ in recent years because even the old system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases were related to the classical versions of pacific slavery ) . But now with AEWV you can just set up a human trafficking ring without any qualms . Just get the slaves *cough* migrants to give up their live savings , get them to work without legal contracts , fail to pay for time worked or even as contracted , strip the pay from them with " charges " and then threaten them and their families if they do n't work . <p> When you think of slavery often people fail to realize it existed long before the African slave trade and was in many different versions . <p> Even Maori tribes had and used slavery and many utu resolutions resulted in slavery . It is what it is . Part of history and human cultures world over .

Maybe it 's the psychology of losing money , you need to keep track and stay on top of it so you need a weekly update of how much you 're losing ... <p> So is paying for a rental property to live in . Why not just burn the cash in front of you because renting is very close to doing that . There is a difference in using property solely as an investment vehicle vs using property to live in . In the former those with 4 or 5 properties might be discouraged by the market changes if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equity growth for them already . In the later if the choice is between owning and renting only one sees the entire lifetime of cash go up in smoke ( well not unless you are on leasehold land with building restrictions with no insurance and decide to burn the house down ) . In fact over time housing has been the best investment for retirement as it also allows for accommodations &amp; necessary changes to allow for degeneration . It is far better then winding up on the street at the age of 75 with mobility housing needs that are not available in the private rental market . You may need to learn it is very hard to live in a house if you can not enter the door or use the bathroom . <p> The paragraph on immigration stating " an upwardly-revised +3400 ( net inflow ) in May " does n't seem to reconcile with the linked article which states " That turned the previously estimated net loss of 2043 in May to a net gain of 363 .

Reality is that banks irresponsibly created way more claims for gold than they had gold , kept defaulting , and lost trust . So the government made gold illegal to own for like 40 years . <p> The U.S. was no different . Commercial banks and Federal Reserve banks had a gold reserve requirement .

It is n't due to a failing of the left that the right wing nut jobs have been voted in , it 's down to a concerted comms strategy by anti-moderates around similar anti-woke narratives that aim to divide society and exploit opportunities presented by structural weaknesses in the economic system .

@@112648239 <p> Sydney Sweeney is certainly a lot of things . A phenomenal actor , for starters . Charismatic , caring and kind -- her gentle character shines through in any interview she 's in . Naturally beautiful . A fashion icon . A calming aura about her . Warm , highly-driven and a bundle of high-energy , like a battery . Whenever you see her walk a red carpet , or grace an interview she 's poised , soft-spoken , so articulate . She 's had a monumental rise to fame over the last couple of years with an elegant classic Hollywood style , often branded ' an old-school movie star ' or ' Gen-Z 's answer to Marilyn Munroe . ' <p> The unique and cool thing about Sydney Sweeney that certainly sets her apart from the rest is her gift of playing the radiant young woman -- bright-eyed . You can feel it oozing off her as she performs in one of her roles . Like as Cassie in Euphoria , or Olivia in The White Lotus . Sydney Sweeney is certainly the full package . <p> Born in 1997 in Spokane , Washington to a criminal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kilometres east of the Washington border in northern Idaho . Her family home was a cabin by a lake , away from any noisy inner-city hubbub . The small picturesque town was two streets long with a church , three bars and a small supermarket . Everyone knew everyone . <p> ' What 's so beautiful about the Pacific-Northwest is everything that you can do outdoors , ' Sweeney told Travel + Leisure at the start of this year . <p> Her parents encouraged her to follow her passions and faith in God , and ' fall in love with as many things as possible ' . She was quite shy and reserved , uncomfortable with her body and actively avoided doing anything that 'd draw attention to her , like school plays or public speaking . So even the notion that she would one day be one of the hottest stars in Hollywood would 've been a wild idea at this early stage in her life . <p> Back home at the cabin on weekends and after school , though , she used her imagination to create whole imaginary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret agent , or a princess cheetah , or a teacher instructing a class of her ' insect students ' . <p> As well as being an avid learner ( she attended Saint George 's private school through her childhood ) , she loved the beauty of the outdoors , which turned bitterly cold and snowy in the winter and then hot and toasty in the summer . With the wonderful outdoors at her fingertips , Sweeney 's list of hobbies grew and grew . She loved playing sports . Football , skiing , baseball , golf , and dancing ballet , to name but a few . Even more dangerous things like MMA and wakeboarding ... <p> ' I think I was 11 or 12 , I got in a wakeboarding accident and the board came up , sliced my face and I have a scar . I had to get a bunch of stitches , ' Sweeney told Sean Evans on Hot Ones in January this year . Ouch ! <p> Sydney 's first taste of acting came in 2009 ( after healing from the wakeboard incident ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Destruction , was set to film in her hometown and hold auditions . She begged and begged and begged her parents to allow her to audition for it . After some resistance from her parents , the young Sydney wrote up a five-year business plan to present via Microsoft Powerpoint 2008 . Ahhh , the good ol ' days . <p> The audition , as you can only guess , went without a hitch and she landed the non-speaking role of Lisa . Young Sydney had caught the acting bug then , and spent months and months to secure more auditions for herself trying to make her dreams come true . It 's interesting to add that Sydney was never obsessed with film and rarely watched TV . Acting was a natural thing to her , sort of like a life-force she found in her soul . <p> So she went searching for more . Calls started coming in from LA . More audition offers than you can wag a stick at . Before long her parents were driving 19 hours to-and-from California . She did n't give up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still keeping on top of her school work , getting straight-A 's and even had become the president of the robotics club . She even taught herself Russian , for which she is fluent . Reportedly she identifies herself ' as a bit of a nerd ' . <p> The road to Cali did take its toll , however . ' My mum , my dad , my brother and I were in a regular one-bedroom hotel room for nine months . ' My heart truly aches ( and breaks ) thinking about the cost of petrol . Their hearts must have ached too , as they decided -- when Sydney turned 13 -- to move themselves from Idaho to Cali ( probably to save on travel costs ) . Having openly admitted her life was n't always spent living the big Hollywood dream , she joked to Associated Press in 2022 that her family were ' the poor version of The Suite Life of Zack and Cody . ' ' There were many , many years where I got told " No " endlessly . I got told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , I was n't pretty enough -- all the time . ' Reportedly , it took 100 auditions in LA and heaps of meetings with possible agents for Sydney to land her first roles as minor characters in shows such as 90210 , Criminal Minds and Grey 's Anatomy . It was in 2011 , just starting up her career , she was nominated for her first set of Young Artist awards -- for the short film , Takeo , and the TV series , Chase . Success was already heading her way . Her first break-out role came in Netflix 's comedy-drama , Everything Sucks ! which filmed in 2017 and hit the screens in 2018 . That year was an important year for Sweeney , as the world became obsessed with the young star . In the series , Sweeney played Emaline Addario , a junior student in the fictional Boring High School drama club with a flair for the arts . Sydney took great inspiration from a certain early-2000 's pop-icon , Gwen Stefani . <p> ' Emaline is an overdramatic , insecure teenage girl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's always the type of girl who will get up on top of the tables to start doing Shakespearean monologues so that she can get people to look her way and get people 's attention . She does n't know who she is yet . ' <p> After Everything Sucks ! came the call for HBO 's psychological-thriller , Sharp Objects , in which she played Amy Adams ' character 's teenage roommate at a psychiatric hospital , and then the martyred child bride Eden Blaine in season two of Margret Attwood 's The Handmaid 's Tale . <p> ' I was filming the shows at the same time , ' Sydney continued . ' During the week , I 'd be filming Everything Sucks ! and then I 'd take a red-eye to either LA or Atlanta and would go finish up filming for Sharp Objects . It was night and day since my characters were so completely different . ' <p> The world was starting to get word of Sweeney and her natural acting talents , and they wanted more of it . It 'd be remiss not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling with the character of Diane ' Snake ' Lake , one of Charles Manson 's groupies at Spahn Ranch , in Quentin Tarantino 's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood . <p> ' It was so much fun , ' Sweeney told Build Series in 2019 while working on the Tarantino film . ' Ya know when you have that bucket-list of all the people you wish to one day work with and then you just cross them all off on the exact same day . It was a surreal experience . I learnt so much . ' <p> In the same interview , she was asked if she 'd attended the infamous premiere at the Cannes Film Festival where Tarantino and the main cast received a seven minute ( slightly awkward ) standing ovation . <p> ' I was filming Euphoria , ' she replied to the interviewer . ' I really wanted to be there but I was still filming . ' <p> Ah yes , Euphoria ! If you have n't seen Euphoria , what rock have you been living under ? Starring the likes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few , the first season was the second-most watched HBO series of all time ( sitting closely behind Game of Thrones , until it was dethroned by House of the Dragon ) , and the second series had earth-shattering viewer numbers too . <p> Euphoria follows high schoolers in the fictional town of East Highland , California , who seek hope while balancing the strains of love , loss , sex , and addiction . <p> Though Sydney was very much a working actor at that stage , Euphoria made her a household name . It 's interesting to note that she initially turned down the role of Cassie at the beginning , however , as it contained nudity , which she was n't comfortable with . Reportedly , Sydney has always had issues with her body . It was in stepping out of her comfort zone whilst playing Cassie that she became empowered in herself , not letting any of the haters win on how they perceived her body . In turn , Sydney playing the role of Cassie in Euphoria allowed her to shine a light on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strongly maintains the view on embracing her body and feeling empowered in her skin , challenging the narrative around objectification , adding a layer of depth to her public persona . <p> ' Cassie truly is a dream to play , ' Sydney told Josh Horowitz on Apple 's Happy , Sad , Confused podcast , ' and as an actor I 'm so fortunate that I 've had a character like her at such a young age . Of course , I wan na keep living her crazy . I love it ! ' <p> Sydney 's character , Cassie Howard had so much to unpack for her to sink her teeth into . Howard is portrayed as a beautiful bombshell from a broken home . In the first season , Sweeney portrays her as this sweet and nice girl who constantly makes wrong decisions . In the second season , all-hell-breaks-loose and the character really goes into a downward spiral . The scene in the spa -- if you know you know . <p> If you have n't seen this cultural phenomenon , you must watch it ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series , plus more accolades which are far too long to list . <p> ' In Euphoria we 're playing characters that mean so much to people , ' Sweeney said on Happy , Sad , Confused . ' It 's the longest production I 've worked on . Each season takes eight-to-10 months to film . So I 've been able to build relationships with people and have almost like a family . Like Maud Apatow is my best friend , she 's like my actual sister . I feel so lucky to have something like that in this industry . ' <p> Alongside her rise-to-fame in Euphoria , Sydney also played to her strengths and took as step into the unknown by co-founding her own production company , Fifty-Fifty Films , alongside Canadian Jean-Marc Vall ? e and Nathan Ross ' Crazyrose and Endeavor Content . The other founder is her now fiancee , Jonathan Davino . <p> The premise of the production company is to allow equal opportunities in fields traditionally less accessible to many . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a different background , or are of a certain age , Sweeney emphasises that their voices deserve to be heard . <p> ' Being able to make a dream of theirs that they did n't think was possible for years and years happen , is amazing , ' Sweeney said to Grazia . ' To never put a limit to what their capabilities are because they 're female , or their age , or their background . I 'm a big advocate for making sure everybody 's voice is heard . ' <p> In 2021 , another big part crossed her desk . Coming off the back of Euphoria , everyone wanted a slice of Sweeney . It was a part written by American writer , producer and actor Mike White . The HBO series , The White Lotus , fit Sydney 's acting style to a T and really allowed her to show off her acting chops . <p> The first season of The White Lotus , in which Sydney played Olivia Mossbacher , was set at an exclusive Hawaiian resort , and explored the numerous goings-on of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiery , spoiled college student , brimming with teenage angst who is on holiday with her family . Olivia 's mother , Nicole ( played by Connie Britton ) is the CFO of a search engine company , and her father , Mark ( played by Steve Zahn ) has a mysterious illness . Hilarious calamity at its finest . <p> In finding her character , Sydney said to Mara Webster of In Creative Company , that she needed to find the balance between caring and not caring . Sweeney listened to hundreds of podcasts that Mike White recommended to her to find the ' funny in the natural ' . She also found her character of Olivia through just hanging out with the others on set . Her natural kindness went a long way here ( most probably learnt , in turn ) from her time on Euphoria where she really made a family of actors . She 's been quoted as saying that she thinks that Jennifer Coolidge is one of the funniest people alive , purely from spending so much time with her onset and getting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cooledge does seem ridiculously funny . <p> ' I think we got to build a more comfortable environment , ' she said to Mara . ' I think , as an actor , you feel safer exploring different avenues as your art . Being at a very safe camp is a great feeling . ' <p> Being so comfortable and confident in her art then allowed her to explore the character more deeply . She was awarded a nomination for a Primetime Emmy Award for that role . <p> It 's crazy to think that even before the age of 30 , Sydney had really made a name for herself as an actor being part of two of the biggest shows in HBO history . <p> In an interview with Variety last year , she said to Kinley Franklin that between The White Lotus and Euphoria , she definitely has a favourite . <p> ' Olivia is a fun , snarky character , ' Sweeney said . ' But Cassie challenges me in so many different ways because she is such a character . As an actor , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places you may never have gone to before . ' <p> Marion Curtis / StarPix for Sony Pictures <p> So as Sydney 's name is becoming the biggest in Hollywood ( on both TV and cinema screens ) , her resume continues to get busier and busier with more and more amazing projects . Yes she 's an amazing actor who can lighten up the screen with her talent and acting range , but she 's also a genuinely giving , good-hearted human . <p> ' I recently paid off my mum 's mortgage , ' the star revealed to WhoWhatWear earlier this year , adding how taking care of her parents ' was a really big thing for her to be able to do . ' She also brought back her great-grandmother 's house from developers for her grandmother . Cute ! <p> During the Christmas period of the Covid-19 pandemic , Sydney even donated $48,000 to local restaurants in her Sponake hometown and meals to feed the homeless . ' I hope I 'm able to provide a little holiday relief for both the restaurants , who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be facing a really , really tough winter , ' Sweeney said .

" These results for them have been a lot better than expected . " <p> KMD Brands , which is due to release its result on September 25 , has seen a recovery in its share price since August 9 but still has a long way to go to get to where it was even at the start of this year . Its shares opened on Thursday at 57c down from around a dollar in early January . <p> On Tuesday the company reported an underlying net profit after tax of $51.8m , within its guidance range and slightly up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issued a profit warning in which it slashed its earnings forecast for the 2024 year and in its result presentation backed off any timeline for its longer-term $100m profit goal . <p> The analysts say investors should see the result as incrementally positive for two reasons ; they 're not expecting a change in future net profit consensus , ( Forsyth Barr forecasts $61.4m ) and any lingering doubts over the balance sheet should be allayed . <p> " Tourism Holdings ' belief that this level of earnings is achievable in future provides a clear pathway for profits over the medium term . <p> " There were other tailwinds , including the final 5c dividend in the mid-payout range , and robust earnings growth supported by a cyclical recovery over the medium term . " <p> Although Bowley and Lockwood lowered the target share price from $3.60 to $3.45 , that is double the 12-month low of $1.70 . <h> Chart of the week <p> Spark was a big disappointment this reporting season , with earnings falling short of already downgraded guidance and a subdued outlook putting pressure on dividend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this week , their lowest price since April 2019 , and the chart shows a 32% decline since mid-January . <p> The telco revealed some hefty restructuring , saying it will cut $50m , or 10% , from its labour costs this financial year . As the Herald 's technology editor Chris Keall reported earlier in the week , that translates to potentially hundreds of jobs on the line . <p> At the same time , Spark is juggling its investment programme - including a $1b spend on data centre expansion over the next five to seven years - with declining cash flow and shareholder expectations . <p> Spark 's earnings , adjusted for one-offs , dropped 2.5% to a below-forecast $1.163b in FY24 , and it is forecasting an increase in FY25 to between $1.165b and $1.222b . <p> The telco said its dividend will stay at 27.5 cents per share ( cps ) in FY25 - which could be seen as a win for dividend-focused shareholders given some analysts had been concerned about a possible cut . <p> However , Stock Takes does note the FY25 dividend is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 100% last year . <h> This gold rush has staying power <p> If this year 's rally in the gold price shows anything , it is that the precious metal is no longer inextricably tied to the interest rate cycle . But that does not mean lower rates will have no impact : talk last week at the Jackson Hole symposium in Wyoming of coming cuts will give gold some extra shine . <p> Traditionally , gold is seen as a better investment when rates are low and when other asset classes are not up to much . By this token , it should have had a dim start to 2024 given the unexpectedly strong performance of US equities , the resilience of the economy , and a delay to expected Federal Reserve rate cuts . Yet it has risen 22% this year , outperforming the S&amp;P 500 , and has recently crossed US$2500 a troy ounce . <p> Clearly , there were some buyers out there whose main concern was not the opportunity cost of holding gold . Enter central banks , which in the first half of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says the World Gold Council . That is the highest amount since the body started collecting data . It is hard not to attribute some of this colossal buying spree to the Russia-Ukraine crisis , and in particular to the freezing of Russian central bank assets that occurred in 2022 . That , predictably , sparked a desire in large emerging economies to shift away from the dollar . <p> While on a quarterly basis purchases will fluctuate - and indeed they were lower in the second quarter compared with the first - that looks like a structural tailwind for gold demand independent of everything else happening in the financial system . <p> Overlaying this trend is the traditional portfolio rotation into gold , which occurs when interest rates fall . Rich individuals and financial investors have been filling their vaults . Inflows into gold-backed exchange-traded funds resumed in May , and July was the third consecutive positive month with inflows of US$3.7b . While this is cyclical , rather than structural , it does not look like it will turn anytime soon . The market whiplash this summer should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reawakens concerns about equity market volatility . <p> There is , of course , many a scenario in which the gloss comes off the gold trade . An acceleration in the equity market rally , higher-for-longer rates and declining geopolitical risk could all conspire to reduce demand for the metal . But , as it stands , the case for all of these appears to lack lustre . 
@@113200239 <p> Transport Minister Simeon Brown announced this week the Ministry of Transport would develop a monthly on-time performance report for airlines . <p> He said the report will provide valuable insights into on-time arrivals , departures and cancellations , giving both the industry and New Zealanders a clear picture of how well our aviation services are performing . At long last . <p> Such data is widely available overseas through official channels . In the United States , the Department of Transportation releases a monthly analysis of how airlines ' on-time performance ( OTP ) is tracking , making comparisons between them simple . Figures for lost bags and mishandled wheelchairs and scooters are also released in the interests of providing information on the quality of service provided by airlines . <p> Here , Brown acknowledges many countries report OTP data , including Australia . He says he 's committed to improving transparency and performance across the aviation sector . <p> Air New Zealand publishes OTP data on its own website , but only quarterly . Jetstar also publishes figures on its own website , using a monthly timeframe -- which makes comparisons difficult . Both airlines do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless there 's been some marked improvement -- but say they would welcome greater transparency across the country 's aviation sector . <p> Brown also raised the tantalising possibility of requiring public reporting on airfares . At present , the Consumers Price Index ( CPI ) data provides a broad-brush look at where airfares are moving , but more granular and timely price information would be another way of assessing whether there 's price-gouging going on . <p> While this week 's announcement shows progress here , New Zealand still lags other countries in protecting passengers . <p> The Australian Government this week released details of a new external dispute resolution service , ensuring that airlines and airports are held accountable for their conduct . The scheme will also introduce an Aviation Customer Rights Charter , setting out fair and reasonable conduct by airlines and airports , particularly in circumstances such as flight cancellations and delays . <p> Airlines for Australia and New Zealand say reduced disruption , better complaints handling and affordable fares are goals shared by airlines , with great improvements being made since the disruption caused by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is always room to do more . <p> In Europe and the United States , the rules are also clear -- provide the promised service or compensate as of right . <p> Consumer NZ would like to see a scheme similar to that in Australia being introduced here . <p> It says a dedicated ombudsman would not only help consumers but also make it more clear-cut for airlines as well . <p> Consumer Affairs Minister Andrew Bayly is not ruling out more action . He intends to review the Fair Trading Act next year and says it 's possible that increasing consumer protections for air travellers could be included in this . <p> The Government 's moves to increase transparency are admirable first steps .

Wednesday 's tangi was not supposed to be about all that ; politics was supposed to be put to one side . <p> But just enough pointed comments from Maori leaders would have reminded the Government that if it wants to get anywhere close to the kotahitanga , or unity , the country has been talking about since Tuheitia 's death , there is still much to do . <h> read more <p> Just over two weeks ago , Waikato-Tainui leader Rahui Papa stood on the same paepae and told the Prime Minister to " get rid of the Maori bashing racist bills , policies and procedures in this Government " . <p> Papa named changes to the Oranga Tamariki Act : " Mess with our mokopuna and we will not sit quietly . " And Maori leaders made frequent reference to David Seymour 's Treaty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixth day of the king 's tangi was a chance for politicians , the judiciary and foreign diplomats to mark the life and death of a leader who advocated for a better future for tamariki and mokopuna , through unity . <p> Over the week since Tuheitia 's death , politicians have spoken fondly of the king 's advocacy for unity -- a sentiment that 's easy for those in Wellington to espouse in paying tribute to a respected rangatira , but harder to live up to once the tangi is over . <p> The official portrait issued by the Kiingitanga of Kingi Tuheitia . <p> Wednesday was n't a day for politics , but as coalition partners and outspoken leaders descended on the marae , it was clear they were never going to keep all the politics away . <p> Even the evening 's entertainment included a haka about the Treaty of Waitangi and jokes that people wanted to " see less , not see more " of David Seymour . <p> With Christopher Luxon overseas , Winston Peters led the coalition Government delegation to Ngaruawahia . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact , he left before the end of proceedings ; something the 79-year-old acting Prime Minister also did at Koroneihana a fortnight ago . <p> In te reo Maori , he said the king devoted his life to making sure te ao Maori was heard and valued and if anyone was able to unite a divided country , he was the one that had the ability to do so . <p> " On behalf of all of the ministers and our government , I bring prayers , aroha and words of comfort for the ... totara tree who has fallen , " he said . <p> Jones quoted scripture , saying it is better to give than to receive . <p> " And he gave so much towards the latter stages of his life ; he provided a platform , not only for our various iwi , but to enable people to air their anxieties and their concerns . That is no mean task .

" <p> Jones ' comments did n't go unnoticed by the bench , who showed up in force , with representatives of all the courts , including the Waitangi Tribunal . <p> Both Chief District Court Judge Heemi Taumaunu and the country 's first Maori judge appointed to the Supreme Court , Justice Joe Williams , spoke on behalf of the judiciary . <p> Taumaunu reflected on the meaning of kotahitanga . <p> " I suggest , like a tree , there 's going to be many different branches ; many different interpretations ; many components of this idea of kotahitanga . " <p> But he finished by referring back to Jones ' criticisms of the bench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I want to avoid , and should be able to avoid it successfully . When someone lays down a little bit of bait on the atea marae courtyard , then you would be foolish to be a fish ; you should be a whale .

The 68-year-old former Maori Party co-leader and Maori development minister Te Ururoa Flavell led a rousing haka , and an impassioned speech , on behalf of Te Kura o Tipene ( St Stephen 's School ) where Tuheitia went to school . <h> Nowhere to hide on the paepae <p> But the most anticipated performance -- at least during the day 's formalities -- came from Act 's Seymour . <p> The Act leader was criticised for not attending Tuheitia 's 18th Koroneihana , and while the sentiment may have been that Seymour was a fortnight late and a few bucks short , his decision to travel to Turangawaewae on Wednesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seymour , welcome to Turangawaewae .

Photo : Getty Images <p> Staggering new figures revealed in an Official Information Act request to the Inland Revenue Department show child support payers owe just shy of $1 billion . <p> But perhaps the really astonishing news is , that 's the lowest the debt has been since 2005 . <p> Of the total debt of $999,707,882 , 42 percent of it -- $420,645,355 -- is in penalties . <p> The total debt includes 18,688 people whose children have turned 18 or for some other reason no longer have a liability for their children , and yet they still have arrears . Most of them -- 12,167 people , or 65 percent -- have made an arrangement to pay . <p> Of current child support payers , more than half of them ( 52 percent , or 47,560 people ) , are in arrears . Add in those who should have finished paying , and the number of defaulters climbs to 72 percent . <p> Just 36 people have been taken to court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inland Revenue says that small number is because the vast majority of people facing legal action either pay , or make arrangements to pay . <p> " Court action is a last resort and a lot of work is done to get the money paid before a case is considered for prosecution , " IRD told The Detail in a statement . <p> In the year to June 2024 , there were eight arrests at the border of people with child support debt . <p> The department says it collected $480 million in child support from more than 127,000 parents in 2023/24 . <p> Today on The Detail we talk to Dr Michael Fletcher , who is a senior research adjunct at the Institute of Governance and Policy Studies at Victoria University .

" The basic approach I think is sound : ' If you can sort things out privately that 's great ... we the state are there as a back up with a formula that 's not too bad , to make it work .

@@114243236 <h> John MacDonald : More ludicrous council spending in Christchurch <p> The Christchurch City Council has learned nothing from the cathedral debacle . <p> Because it 's now going to spend $19.5 million over the next four years , so that work can start on repairing and restoring the old provincial chambers building in the centre of town . <p> $19.5 million . Nearly twice as much ratepayer money as what was going to go into the cathedral . To get things started on a repair job which is expected to cost around $200 million . <p> I get it . It 's got history . It 's very relevant in terms of the history of Canterbury . It 's a beautiful building . No arguments from me on those fronts . <p> But , as far as I 'm concerned , the council should n't be pouring money into what could turn out to be a rinse and repeat of the cathedral debacle . <p> The building itself dates back to 1858 and is the only purpose-built provincial government building that still exists in New Zealand . <p> It was originally built to be the headquarters of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But when the provincial government was disestablished in 1876 , it was used as offices for various government departments . <p> Eventually , the Christchurch City Council became responsible for it .

So that work can start on something that 's expected to cost 10-times that . <p> When is the council going to learn not to throw millions of dollars at something that has next to zero certainty of getting finished ? <p> Because $19.5 million is a drop in the bucket compared to the rest of the money that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another $180 million is going to be needed . <p> But , just like happened with the cathedral , money 's going to be chipped-in here and chipped-in there on some sort of wing and a prayer that the rest of it will come from somewhere . <p> Now , to be fair , there 's possibly a greater likelihood of the Government helping out on this one . But it wo n't be to the tune of $180 million . <p> Finance Minister Nicola Willis justified the Government 's decision not to bail-out the cathedral reinstatement because it considered the cathedral not to be owned by the public and that its public use was limited because it is a private , religious space . <p> You might also recall her saying a few weeks back that the Canterbury Museum redevelopment - which is also underway and also short of all the money needed - might be more likely to get government support because it is a place used by the general public . <p> Nevertheless , here we go again , with the city council pouring ratepayer money into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just like the cathedral . <p> It 's especially bad when you consider how tight it was with funding for the Arts Centre .

" <p> Moser soon got into more detail . <p> The first time he tackled an opponent , Moser said , Nepia had to speed up , " and crash into his stomach with your shoulder " . <p> " You 'll knock him backwards , and all the air will go out of his lungs . You might knock him out . " <p> For the second tackle , Moser changed the particulars . " Go below his knees . Move in from the same distance as before , and hit him hard .

" There wo n't be a third time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right way , the third time he will kick . " <p> Nepia became fascinated by how far Moser , who seemed ancient to a schoolboy but was actually still in his 20s , could spiral pass a football . <p> " I started to think of the possibilities of imitating the way he could throw the ball 40 or 50 metres , sending it spinning like a top . I wanted to do the same with a punt . I used to stay after team training with a couple of teammates kicking to each other . One day , I fired off the perfect spiral punt . I was shocked and so excited I found it hard to sleep that night . " <p> Invincible they were , and the Invincibles they remain . This image is displayed at the New Zealand Sports Hall of Fame in Dunedin , New Zealand .

He called it " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee of good punting " . <p> After school , he made a star-studded Hawke 's Bay side , as a second five-eighths . But bizarrely , his debut in a first-class match as a fullback was the first All Blacks trial of 1924 in Auckland . It was only the second time in his life he 'd played at fullback . <p> He performed so well in what was then the No 1 jersey , that when an All Black squad of 23 players was named for a four-game warm-up tour of Australia in July 1924 , Nepia was the only fullback . <p> But before they headed for Britain , The Invincibles were roasted by Auckland media in a way Ian Foster or Scott Robertson might recognise . <p> Returning from Australia they were beaten , 14-3 , by Auckland at Eden Park . The 1905 All Black George Tyler said in The New Zealand Herald they were the worst team to ever represent New Zealand . In the Auckland Star , a writer said " it is a disgrace Auckland are not being sent north , instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Nepia was still irate about the comments . He told me in ' 74 , " We 'd got off the boat from Australia at two o'clock in the morning after the roughest sea trip you could imagine . We played Auckland that afternoon ! We were all still swaying from the boat 's motion . I waited to catch one high ball , and started to rock so much I fell tail over head before the ball landed . " <p> By contrast , the tour of Britain and France was an unmitigated triumph . <p> After beating Ireland ( 6-0 ) , the All Blacks swept past Wales ( 19-0 ) , England ( 17-11 ) , and France ( 30-6 ) . ( Not a single game was played in Scotland , because -- I am not making this up -- officials there were still sulking because they 'd made a poor deal on gate receipts from the 1905 test with the All Blacks at Inverleith . ) <p> As the tour went on , Nepia talked with his captain , Cliff Porter , about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?

" <p> After the glory days of The Invincibles , Nepia 's talent never faltered , but his sporting career took some unexpected turns . <p> At a time when the NZRU grovelled to South Africa 's racist rules , Nepia was one of several gifted Maori players left behind when New Zealand toured South Africa in 1928 . His All Blacks career ended in 1930 , when he played fullback in all four tests against the British Lions , New Zealand winning the series 3-1 . <p> Nepia had married the love of his life , Huinga Kohere , in 1926 .

@@114890234 <p> BOGOTA ( 4 September 2024 ) -- Peace in Colombia can only be achieved by addressing the country 's class divisions and widespread discrimination facing people in poverty , the UN 's independent human rights expert on poverty said today , ending a visit to the country . <p> " Rich and poor Colombians live worlds apart and these worlds very rarely collide , " said Olivier De Schutter , the UN Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights . " Yet unless eradicating poverty becomes a priority for all Colombians , no matter their income bracket , the vicious cycle of poverty and conflict will continue , and the country will never know peace . " <p> He warned that poverty was fuelling the ongoing conflict in Colombia -- a conflict that has severely constrained the country 's socio-economic development , with extraordinarily high human and environmental costs . <p> " A lack of employment opportunities is making people in poverty an easy target for recruitment by non-state armed groups , and a lack of viable alternatives for coca farmers is leaving them with little choice but to continue growing illicit crops , " De Schutter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principal causes of poverty in the country , with non-state armed groups forcing people to leave their homes and lands for fear of being caught in the crossfire , or forcibly confining them to their homes , making it impossible for them to attend school , work or healthcare facilities . <p> " Throughout Colombia , criminal gangs are also emptying the tills of small businesses through extortion and the pockets of desperate people through extortive money-lending . " <p> The Special Rapporteur expressed concern at the country 's social stratification system -- whereby neighbourhoods are classified from 1-6 , with six being the richest and one the poorest -- calling the planning policy " institutionalised social segregation " and a major obstacle to eradicating poverty and achieving peace . <p> " While the idea that ' higher ' strata residents pay more for their utilities to subsidise utilities in ' lower ' strata is laudable , the unintended consequence has been to keep Colombians locked into their neighbourhoods , " the expert said . <p> " Given how little people of different income groups interact in Colombia -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- it is little wonder that it would take 11 generations for a child born into a poor family to earn an average wage . <p> " Exacerbating this crisis of social mobility is the fact that Colombians have come to use the system to classify people , not just neighbourhoods , a clear case of the ' povertyism ' that stigmatises those in lower strata and makes it harder for them to access decent jobs or public services . " <p> De Schutter welcomed plans to move away from social stratification towards a Universal Income Registry . He also commended recent government efforts to implement more progressive taxation , increase the minimum wage and improve the pension system , expressing hope that health and education reforms would also be approved as an important step towards addressing social segregation in a country in which " gaps in access to , and quality of , education and healthcare are vast " . <p> Referring to Colombia 's illegal drug trade -- a major source of violence and poverty -- the Special Rapporteur called for the full implementation of the 2016 Peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Providing farmers with financial and technical assistance is not enough for crop substitution to work , " said De Schutter .

@@115203232 <h> 2024 Volkswagen Golf GTE review <h> Words : Peter Louisson Photos : Isaac Western <h> It might not look as angry as a GTI but VW 's GTE is all but as quick and is also capable of seriously low fuel use . <p> Sometimes vehicles happen along and you wonder why you 're driving them . So it was with Volkswagen Golf 's GTE , a plug-in hybrid . <p> Are we driving it because the Golf has just turned 50 ? Kind of , yes . The milestone happened in May , and evidently VW has made 37 million Golfs during the past half century . <p> It 's not the world 's best selling car , which would be Corolla , but it is in second spot if you ignore full-sized pick-ups , like the F-150 . <p> Golf has just been updated overseas , and is now into its Gen 8.5 iteration . It features new lighting and bumpers up front and rear , and new tech inside , including AI-enhanced voice control . <p> But it 's not here yet and instead we are sampling a PHEV variant of the outgoing model . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all kinds at present . <p> And that 's on account of the EV revolution being on-pause currently , as governments can no longer afford EV subsidies . <p> And to add insult to injury here , they 've slapped on road user charges that are the same as those for the high-emitting diesels . Does n't seem quite fair does it , given EVs are emissions-free . <p> Anyhow , hybrids and PHEVs are flavour of the moment , even though they 're petrol burners and the EU is saying no more sales of ICE power vehicles from 2035 . Still , that 's quite some time off . <h> How much exactly ? <p> This new GTE PHEV model originally went for $75,990 but you can " for a limited time only , save $11,000 on the Golf GTE " , making it $64,990 in theory . <p> But actually the new price is $59,990 , the same as the ID.4/5 , which were originally $79,990 . They are the better value offerings , for they are bespoke EVs built on an EV platform and are huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't quite as nippy as the GTE , but they have decent EV range of 519km . That of the Golf PHEV is ' up to 60km ' . <p> Only being a test unit , this one would n't show more than 42km range when charged . Either way , that 's not much in the PHEV scheme of things ; some are cracking 100km these days . <p> However , the reason for the limited EV range is that the Golf GTE is built on the MQB platform and there really was not any more room under the boot floor for a battery pack bigger than 13kWh . <p> As it is , said power source has robbed the GTE of a fair amount of storage space , down from 380L to 273L . <h> How much fuel use ? <p> You can tell it is a PHEV from the charger lid on the rear of the left front fender . With its charger you can rezip a flat battery on an overnight charge . Which of course is what you should do ever night . <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct submenu you can push the hybrid mode button and then settings , and then push the ' up ' button to 100 per cent of battery charge . The GTE engine will then rezip the battery using petrol power . <p> Which is what many will end up doing on a trip because it is so much easier than faffing around charging . You can plug into a public AC charger ( 7-22kW ) but it makes no difference to time spent hooked up because the on-board charger is 3.6kW . <p> So figure on 3.5 hours , the same as it takes a conventional home wallbox to recharge it from flat . <p> Volkswagen rates mean fuel economy at 1.2L/100km . That 's under optimal conditions for folk living in town who recharge regularly when they need to . <p> Using the engine , however , it took the better part of 100km to refill it , and fuel use for that time was 8.5L/100km . <p> Now the engine at the basis of the PHEV is a 1.4 TSI that develops 110kW and 250Nm . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> When it 's not also acting as a generator our GTE got down to 6.2L/100km . <p> If you use this as directed , you really can expect amazing fuel economy of next to nothing . With an 85kW/330Nm motor you can easily drive the GTE in town without the engine ever firing . <p> And it goes well as a pure EV , away from the lights in snappy fashion , without the hybrid delay as it happens . <h> How fast precisely ? <p> Sling the two power sources together and this comfortably overwhelms the front tyres , such is its 180kW and 400Nm combined output . That 's why VW calls it the GTE . <p> It 's just so close to GTI in nomenclature and potential . The Golf GTi is somewhat lighter at 1350kg versus 1602kg . Acceleration claims have the GTE complete the 0-100 sprint in 6.7sec , versus 6.3sec for the GTI . <p> Slot the GTE in Sport mode , wind back ESP to Sport , and we managed exactly that , 6.7sec , but with a fair bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? It managed 6.3sec , the same as the GTI claim . Coincidence ? I think not . <p> So it really does earn its GT(E) stripes . The GTI is in runout at $64,990 so if you want as much performance as that but a greener alternative the GTE would be that . <p> Why , it even has the tartan cloth seat trim that is the calling card of the GTI . Only VW calls it something a bit different ( Scale Paper ) . This GT gets sports seats as well . <p> They 're not electric or anything but they are supportive , delve down deep when you need them to , and have manual lumbar adjustment . Not enough mind you but better than none at all . <h> How much spec then ? <p> It does n't have quite the spec you might expect of a car that started out at $76k . There 's no traffic sign recognition , and no powered seats or electric fifth door either . <p> Aside from the EV and hybrid modes , there 's Eco , Normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D and S modes at the stubby wee gear lever . <p> And there are all the expected safety and convenience items , other than those we mentioned earlier . <p> So the GTE pretty much fulfills VW New Zealand 's remit . Its GM , Chanelle McDonald , says : " Volkswagen is committed to embracing the shift towards sustainable transportation , providing consumers with eco-friendly vehicles that allow them to reduce their carbon footprint without compromising on performance . " <p> Just make sure you use it as directed on the tin to get the most from it . It 's aimed primarily at folk who live and work in the city , and travel out of town occasionally . <p> Golf Gen VIII is now in runout . Expect the next GTE ( version 8.5 ) to have more power ( 202kW ) , a bigger battery ( 19kWh ) and added range ( 100km ) . <p> NZ Autocar is New Zealand 's leading automotive magazine .

( John Wells was an executive producer of both ER and The West Wing . ) <p> But the show'ssophisticated content , idiosyncratic sensibility and season-long storylines anticipated the prestige-television boom of cable and eventually streaming . It was a ratings hit and won the Emmy for outstanding drama series four times , one of only five programmes to do so . ( The others : Hill Street Blues , L.A.

Sorkin wrote or co-wrote nearly every episode of the first four seasons and then left the series , which continued for three more seasons without him and ended in 2006 . <p> Although it took place in an alternative universe , The West Wing initially resembled the late Clinton era in Washington ( minus the sex scandal ) .

Cregg ( Allison Janney ) , Sam Seaborn ( Rob Lowe ) , Donna Moss ( Janel Moloney ) , Toby Ziegler ( Richard Schiff ) , Leo McGarry ( John Spencer ) and Josh Lyman ( Bradley Whitford ) , whose peccadilloes , tics and even alma maters became well known to fans . They shared jibes , arguments and loyal comradeship while doing their work with passion and idealism . <p> Aaron Sorkin did n't expect The West Wing to become a hit . " I was very surprised when I had to write an Episode 2 , " he said .

' " <p> The West Wing has been criticised as a fantasy -- an imaginary world where ( according to conservatives ) Democrats are unrealistically sensible , and ( according to liberals ) Republicans are unrealistically principled . <p> Sorkin denies that The West Wing was intended to preach liberalism or any other political perspective . " The show does n't exist so that I can make a point about the census or anything else , " he said . " Writers have been telling stories about kings and palaces for centuries . This was another one .

And I was pleasantly surprised . <p> Q : What do you remember from the early days of making The West Wing ? <p> A : I tend to write people talking in rooms . And it was up to the director Tommy Schlamme to find a way to make that visually interesting . He came to me before the first day of shooting the pilot and said , " This opening , where you have Leo talking to a bunch of people in his office -- how would it be if I had them walking while they were talking ?

We had to shoot it all night at a hotel downtown , and it was only at night that they let us do this . It was an eight-page Steadicam shot . There are no cuts ; you have to get it in one take . On the fifth take , we got it , and there was Martin jumping up and down like a kid : " Let 's do it again ! Let 's do it again ! That was fun !

So when people say that they were inspired to public service because of the show , it 's incredibly meaningful . <p> Q : But that was not the goal . <p> A : Exactly right . By the way , we assumed that if the pilot got picked up , which we doubted it would , that we certainly would n't get past 13 episodes . I was very surprised when I had to write an Episode 2 . <p> Networks were very nervous about any show that dealt with politics , and certainly this show was n't really being discreet about its politics . It was using the same kind of language that we hear on the news every night . There were Democrats and Republicans . Bartlet 's politics were pretty well known . <p> Q : Networks worried that viewers would associate the show with real-life politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you remember about the political world The West Wing was entering ? <p> A : The pilot was supposed to happen a year earlier than it did , and Monica happened , and there was a sense that everyone 's going to roll their eyes , let 's hold off for a year . I wanted it to feel like our world . But I did n't mention presidents after Eisenhower , maybe even earlier . I did n't make any pop culture references , because in a world where Britney Spears has the No 1 hit , Bill Clinton is President . That 's why everybody on the show loved Gilbert and Sullivan . <p> Q : When did you start feeling more confident about the show 's prospects ? <p> A : In terms of ratings , it did n't break the dial that first season . We do n't really have summer reruns anymore , but they did back then , in ' 99 . People were starting to hear about it , and then in reruns it kind of got to premiere again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back for Season 2 , it was suddenly a Top 10 show . <p> Q : Bartlet was initially intended to be a peripheral character , right ? <p> A : I thought , We ca n't have a character of the President . He 'll take up all the oxygen in every scene he 's in . So how should we do this ? Should we just see him once in a while ? Should we always just be missing him ? I decided he 'll be a guest character . We 'll see him every three , four , five episodes . In the pilot episode , he comes in in the last six minutes . <p> What happened was Martin had a really good time doing the pilot and came to us and said , " I 'd really like to be in every episode . " And because I was n't entirely confident there were going to be any more episodes , and I did n't have any ideas for any more episodes , I said , " Sure , why not ? " <p> Q @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martin always rejected the idea that he was the star of the show . He insisted , and he was right , that this was an ensemble show . When it came time for Emmy submissions , Martin wanted to submit himself in the supporting actor category -- he thought that to submit himself for lead actor was an insult to Richard and Brad and Rob , and particularly John Spencer . Tommy and I had to beg him to please submit himself in the lead actor category , because if he did n't -- and this is the only thing that convinced him -- he could take a slot away from one of the other actors . So poor Martin had to go up against Jimmy Gandolfini . <p> Sorkin accepting the Emmy for best drama in September 2002 . The West Wing won the award four times . Photo / Getty Images <p> Q : Bartlet is a real piece of work . He can be nasty . He has real demons . He is not always likeable . <p> A : That was my favourite part . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love the demons . But my favourite part of writing Bartlet was that the President is n't a king . He 's this man with a temp job . I always loved the part of the show that was about a father and his adult children , or about a husband . I always loved his fights with Stockard actress Stockard Channing , who played the first lady , Abigail Bartlet . The only times that I wished the show was on HBO instead of a broadcast network were the language restrictions . Cursing can be an expression of being human in a moment when you 're expected to be presidential . <p> Q : You mentioned Sheen and Gandolfini at the Emmys . The West Wing had to go up against The Sopranos three times in your first four seasons , and you always won . <p> A : Listen , The Sopranos is a masterpiece , and it 's rightly recognised as that . I just binged it again recently , and to say it holds up is an understatement . I 've never felt in competition with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who enjoyed that competition . We were called Patrick Ewing in the time of Michael Jordan . I know we were all big fans of The Sopranos , and I hope some of them watched our show once in a while . <p> Q : There are books that chronicle a Golden Age of television that peaked in the 2000s . Do you see The West Wing as part of that conversation ? <p> A : It certainly felt to me like we were a part of a Golden Age of television . I think there 's another one that we 're experiencing now , with streaming . I think that right now the best theatre in America is on television . It used to be difficult to get an actor who was making their living making movies to come to television . Not any more . Same with directors , writers . <p> " When people say that they were inspired to public service because of the show , it 's incredibly meaningful , " Sorkin said . Photo / Jingyu Lin , The New York Times <p> Q @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Succession . Barry . I loved Ted Lasso . <p> Q : One writer at the time said of The West Wing , admiringly , " Subject matter is beside the point . " In other words , the fact that the show was about a liberal Democratic administration was secondary . Do you agree ? <p> A : I would n't want to tell anyone that they are receiving the show the wrong way . Once it 's there for you to watch , it 's yours . But yes , it was for me a great workplace drama in an exciting , glamorous workplace , which at the time we did n't know as much about as we know now . I 've mentioned this , that the first few minutes of the show depended entirely on the audience 's being unfamiliar with the acronym POTUS . And it worked . You could never do it today . <p> Q : We are speaking to each other the day after the only scheduled debate between the two presidential candidates this year . <p> A : If I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I made Kamala Harris fight a straw man . A lot of shows and movies are going to be written about this time that we 're living in now . But my prediction is that you 'll never see Donald Trump as anything but an off-screen character . You 'll see him on a television set on the news . Because he is simply implausible . <p> Q : There is a movie coming out about Trump , but to your point , it is set 40 years ago . <p> A : Sebastian Stan is playing Trump in the ' 70s and ' 80s . I mean President Trump . Even saying it does n't really sound right . <p> Q : It has been a pretty dramatic summer politically . What have you made of it ? <p> A : Over the years , cable newscasters have used the phrase " West Wing moment , " as in : " There 's a clash over the debt ceiling . There 's not going to be a West Wing moment . " They 've used that to mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in the real world , there are not " West Wing moments " .

This is odd because the great actor is n't in the show .

To even be loosely reminded of Gandolfini 's incredible metamorphosis is remarkable . Even more so considering we 're talking about a TV show that 's been spun off from a superhero movie here . <p> This is largely down to Colin Farrell 's outstanding performance/Tony Soprano imitation in the titular role . Buried deep under layers of prosthetics and body padding and speaking with a thick Noo Yawk accent he is unrecognisable . Unless you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not so much in depth of character , but certainly in vibe . <p> The Penguin takes place a week after the conclusion of 2022 's psychological crime thriller The Batman . This film rebooted the caped crusader in a more grounded , less fantastical setting , focusing on his detective skills rather than his arsenal of Bat-gizmos and digging deeply into the trauma of seeing his parents murdered as a child . <p> The Penguin continues with that more grounded vibe and serves as an origin story for Batman 's famous foe , who only appeared briefly in that film . <p> The caped crusader himself does not appear here at all , much to the show 's credit . The focus is kept solely on Oswald Cobb 's ambitious , violent journey from mob middleman to crime lord of Gotham City . <p> The Penguin focuses on the ambitious Oswald Cobb ( played by an unrecognisable Colin Farrell ) and his transformation from mob middleman to crime lord . <p> The Gotham underworld is in disarray after the death of mob boss Carmine Falcone at the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting between the good-earner Cobb and Falcone 's arrogant , drug and alcohol-addicted son Alberto , who has inherited control of the organisation .

Alberto 's scorn and mockery is immediate . <p> As is Cobb 's overreaction . He pulls out his gun and shoots Alberto dead -- a decision he almost immediately regrets . <p> But after sleeping on it , and disposing of the body with the violently coerced help of a teenage delinquent , he begins to see the opportunity he has created for himself . This sets the scheming , ambitious Cobb on a mission to snatch power away from the Falcone family and set himself up as the city 's criminal kingpin . <p> Of course , there are consequences to murdering a mob boss and the show gets ample entertainment milage in Cobb 's dangerous dance with the devils as they attempt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Complicating matters is the arrival of Alberto 's murderous sister Sofia , fresh out of a decade-long stay at Arkham Asylum for a series of brutal murders .

@@115326238 <p> The most powerful Bentley ever , the 2025 Bentley Continental GT has arrived with all the esteem and opulence one would expect from the UK luxury brand . With a massive 575kW , and a proven top speed of 335km/h , the new Conti GT Speed was unveiled to the world 's media in one of the world 's most expensive cities , Zurich , Switzerland , where a cappuccino costs NZ$11 , a can of Coke $9 , and petrol $3.50 per litre . <p> Behind-the-scenes of Bentley&amp;#x27 ; s 335km/h run underwater , in Norway . <p> Feeling very privileged as one of the 100 guests from around the world invited to attend one day of Bentley 's two-week launch program , the new Continental GT is the brand 's premium , two door , four-seat Grand Tourer , now in its fourth-generation . <h> Read More <p> All four of those models were on hand at the event headquarters , the stunning Chedi hotel , in Andermatt , around 90 minutes north of Zurich , and close to the famous Swiss Alps , home to famous locations such as the Grindelwald and Furka Pass and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> All very regal , special and a very incredible experience , and easy to overshadow a lesser car than the Bentley Continental GT . <p> No chance of that , however , with 10 of the new GTs on hand , in its range-topping launch Speed spec , showcased to us across a range of colours and trim combinations , with the only major variant being the GTC Convertible version . <p> The GT Speed coupe generation four is n't just the most powerful , it 's also the first to embrace hybrid technology , using a PHEV plug-in hybrid system and a 26kWh battery designed to improve economy , power and range -- and of course , offer an EV driving mode for when conditions/locations require . <p> Its single electric motor is good for 140kW alone , and also acts as a starter motor , giving the 441kW turbo V8 a boost to its 575kW combined peak . <p> With an eight-speed dual-clutch auto gearbox and all-wheel drive with a tricky electronic rear limited-slip diff , the GT effortlessly blasts to 100km/h in 3.2 seconds , underlined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes the Bentley simply a beast , without any need for artificial audio stimulants . Anyone who 's heard the Bentley racecar at the Bathurst 12 Hour or other GT endurance events will know how incredible it sounds . <p> With more torque present lower down and more linear than the previous W12 engine , the all-new hybrid V8 is a wonder : it does power , speed and sound with ease , but its dual-nature is its 2024-defining difference , able to drive up to 81km in EV mode alone . It 's also a big scavenger , able to recoup and regenerate a lot of energy through its systems when the battery charge level drops below 75% : there are four setting presets : EV , E-boost , Regen and Charge - and the GT will focus a lot of its energy on using the EV power first , staying in EV mode up to 75% throttle position . It 'll also stay in EV up to 140km/h . <p> External charging is via AC , up to 11kW , so perfect for a home Wallbox charger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seated within the Bentley lap of luxury . Our drive program traversed alpine passes typically seen on postcards from best roads of the world , all munched up by the Conti GT with ease . <p> Soft and firm is the Bentley claim , offering both supreme comfort and sharp handling , and the smooth mountain roads certainly highlighted the latter , countless hairpins putting a spotlight on both the agility of a four-wheel steering system , and the ability of the all-wheel drive system , whose balance when powering out of hairpins with big revs and big boost offering hint of power oversteer , with the assurance of all-wheel drive , all while belying its 2.5 tonne . <h> Four generations of Bentley Continental GT <p> First launching as the Bentley Arnage back in 1998 using BMW engines , the Continental GT then ran the 6.75-litre Rolls Royce engine , but with VW ownership , the 2003 Continental GT ushered in a new era , with its 6.0-litre twin-turbo W12 engine and quad headlights . <p> Now with 100,000 sold , the new 2025 GT is n't quite all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new . There are three design philosophies : a resting beast , the body shape is inspired by a seated tiger , a theme backed up by the 22-inch wheels designed to mimmick tiger claws gripping into the ground . <p> Its Upright Elegance is inspired by a thoroughbred horse , while the Endless Bonnet highlights the powerline that flows from the bonnet through to the rear hips . <p> The face has two eyes and a mouth equalling a personality and expression , with its single light and eyebrows drawing focus to the exquisite crystal jewellery detailing with both the headlights and taillights , that glow red at night like molten lava , so say the Bentley reps . <p> The lack of rear spoiler or wing is also a key design feature , wind-tunnel tested , to maintain maximum downforce without the need for it or its garish redudancy . <p> Comfort is paramount and given the amount of combinations offered by the configurator , the mix of Alcantara , leather , a highlight piping colour and simply sublime stitching in our grey coupe was absolutely gorgeous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as hold it . By the way , for those who like relish C-3PO 's odds , there are 46 billion possible combinations of customising , according to Bentley .

" <h> Origins of a catfisher <p> In the time since , I 've tracked down several women who Burgess has used as the faces for characters and those who she tricked into believing those characters were real . <p> Along the way , the investigation revealed the remarkable degree to which Burgess executes her masquerades -- and her motives for doing so . <p> Some of that has meant revisiting the 2011 investigation , and discovering the wounds created by her deceit then continue to cause pain today . <p> Back then , Burgess created a cast of characters centred on the false identity of Laura Jane West . <p> The Herald has learned it was a real-world encounter that led Burgess to the person whose photographs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That encounter happened when a 17-year-old called Natalie was out with work friends and met Natalia at a pub .

There was no new husband or overseas travel or any divorce -- all these things were a fiction that put Russell through the wringer . <p> And then she dumped him again -- and he took his life not long after . <p> Years of reporting and covering suicide have taught me there is rarely a single reason for someone taking their life . <p> But Ford 's loss of her son is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> One of the false " Kaylee " profiles created by Natalia Burgess using photos belonging to Crystal Jenner . <p> " All I knew at that time was Peter was talking to a young , sexy girl on Facebook and that 's all I knew .

When I met with Burgess again for this new investigation , she told me the photographs she had used and personas she created were how she wanted the world to see her . <p> That 's probably why Crystal Jenner 's images were so appealing .

As I investigated I found the age range of people targeted by Burgess had risen . No longer was she talking to boys aged 13-15 . I also discovered a real lean towards Australia .

@@115511232 <p> Mortgage rates have been dropping at an accelerated rate since August when the Reserve Bank cut the OCR to 5.25% . Photo / Fiona Goodall <p> 1 . Will the Reserve Bank meet expectations ? <p> Clearly , the biggest housing market event this week is the Reserve Bank 's Official Cash Rate ( OCR ) decision on Wednesday . There 's little doubt there will be a cut , but just how much of a cut is up for debate . I personally think the Reserve Bank will go for 50 basis points , bringing the OCR down from 5.25% to 4.75% . Financial markets and the bank economists all expect that move , so in some ways , the Reserve Bank may as well deliver that . Indeed , given the continued weakness of economic data , the greater risk now is arguably that inflation goes too low . <p> This suggests that getting the OCR back down to at least a neutral level sooner rather than later is probably a good idea , and whereas in the past that might have run the risk of stoking house price growth , this time around we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules , which are likely to start having an effect next year . <h> Start your property search <p> Two days after the Reserve Bank 's decision , we 'll get Stats NZ 's monthly inflation measure , which includes rents and covers around 45% of the full Consumer Price Index figure . There 's every chance this data will show a further drop in price pressures across the economy , supporting the outlook for further cuts to the OCR . Certainly , falling net migration lately has helped to stabilise rents . <p> 3 . Lower mortgage rates not boosting values yet <p> CoreLogic 's latest market stats suggest the recent mortgage rate cuts by the major banks have yet to flow through to house prices , with property values nationwide dropping 0.5% in September , the seventh monthly drop in a row . Since February NZ values have fallen by nearly 5% and Auckland values have dropped by about 7% , whereas areas such as Dunedin and Christchurch have been a little more resilient . <p> CoreLogic chief economist Kelvin Davidson : " There 's little doubt there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cut is up for debate . " Photo / Peter Meecham <p> The downturn will eventually come to an end , but when it does , vendors should temper their expectations . Reasons for caution about where house prices go over the next 12 to 18 months include still-stretched affordability , abundant listings available for sale , the weaker labour market , and , of course , debt-to-income ratio rules . <p> 4 . Home-ownership rates have risen lately <p> One positive aspect to the weakness of property values in the past two to three years is that first-home buyers have had good scope to enter the market . Consistent with that , Stats NZ released an early batch of 2023 Census data last week , and it showed that the home-ownership rate had risen from 64.5% in 2018 to 66% . At a regional level , Waimakariri ( 82.2% ) and Selwyn ( 80.5% ) had the highest rates , whereas Hamilton ( 53.5% ) , Wellington ( 58.6% ) , and Auckland ( 59.5% ) were amongst the lowest .

Is the end in sight for the dwelling consents downturn ? <p> Last week Stats NZ reported that new dwelling consents in August were 9% lower than the same month in 2023 , which at first glance does n't look particularly encouraging . But if you look at the smoother 12-month rolling total , it 's flattened out at around 33,500 in the past two to three months . Not definite evidence yet that the long downturn is coming to an end , but it 's worth keeping a close eye on anyway .

Her goal is to get more females being active , building their confidence and resilience , and engaging with the outdoors . <p> So far , 355 women and girls have undertaken her outdoor adventure days in the Waikato , which have just won a national sports award . <p> Over the past two years , Parr 's Pirongia-based business , First Step Outdoors , has run 14 adventure days through the POWA and GIRL POWA programmes . Their participants use words like : " Life-changing ... priceless ... extremely valuable " . <p> " We have women who are so emotional to have achieved something they never thought they 'd have the courage to , " Parr says . <p> The programmes won this year 's Women in Sport Aotearoa innovation impact award , with WISPA chief executive Nicky van den Bos saying : " We love this initiative .

The organisation 's " bread and butter work " , running school camps , had ground to a halt . <p> She reflected on the enormously popular women 's adventure day she 'd once run as a fundraiser for the local preschool -- and the hunger that existed for more . <p> " People had always asked , ' When are you going to run that adventure day again ; it was the best day of my life ' , " Parr says . <p> " So I started to run adventure days , with archery , climbing , abseiling , ziplining , for everyone who 'd approached me before Covid and who 'd now been stuck indoors . <p> " We ran some really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community grew just like that .

" <p> Enter GIRL POWA -- outdoor adventure days where teenage girls are joined by a significant female adult in their life -- typically their mum , grandmother , aunty or sister . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , " Parr says , explaining the GIRL POWA adventure days have included learning to cave , mountainbike , climb and kayak . <p> " They get to see and believe that adventure is definitely not just for boys . " <p> Kate Parr ( right ) takes a group caving in the Waikato . Photo : Supplied <p> The programme overcomes many of the barriers to girls ' participation indicated in the Sport New Zealand research , Parr says . " Things like cost , getting to venues , having a support person with you and not being on your own . " <p> And she 's convinced it 's important to offer adventure days for females only . <p> " It makes a big difference not having guys there , " she says . " We notice no one feels under any threat to perform . It 's just about going as high as they 're comfortable with -- challenge by choice . We do n't make anyone do anything they do n't want to .

I told them : ' These are not the conversations we normally have when running tramps up the mountain ' . " <p> Parr has seen the outdoor adventure industry evolve during a 36-year career that almost did n't happen . Growing up , when she told the career counsellor at her Greater London school she 'd like to become an outdoor instructor , she was told such jobs did n't exist for women and was handed information about secretarial school . <p> Undeterred , even while facing countless subsequent rejections , Parr eventually scored her first role at an outdoor centre in Epping Forest .

" If it was n't for her , there 's no way I 'd be doing what I do for a job now . " <p> Parr ensures activities at First Step Outdoors are accessible to groups with disabilities . And at this year 's New Zealand Outdoor Instructors Association symposium , Parr will run an inclusive practices workshop sharing her knowledge about adapting outdoor activities . <p> " Instructors know how to run climbing sessions , but let 's make them inclusive , " she says . " Whatever the reason somebody is not being included , anything physical or mental , try and reduce the barriers . " <p> Kate Parr ( left ) talks through the technique of abseiling to a POWA participant .

But she has an eye to the future , too . <p> Her current priority is to secure funding for future GIRL POWA programmes so they can continue to be subsidised for those who otherwise could n't afford to participate . <p> Parr is also preparing a group of 20 women to climb all 959 metres of Pirongia-o-Te Aroaro-o-Kahu ( Mt Pirongia ) : " We 've got a group of local women who 've never been to the top of their mountain , so that 's really exciting .

Recorded at Doctor Lee Prebble 's Surgery Studios in Wellington , its ten-song tracklist captures the dynamic energy and juxtapositions that power their percussive grooves , spellbinding horn section and Johnson 's silky smooth songcraft and spoken word strut . <p> Described by Rolling Stone Australia as " strangely alluring , " the femme-fronted eight-piece formed in Wellington under the de facto leadership of the composer , lyricist , bassist and vocalist Phoebe Johnson in 2019 . Since then , Johnson and her clown van full of hyper-busy musical collaborators , Lily Rose Shaw , Toby Leman , Hector McLachlan , Kaito Walley , Lennox Grootjans , Mysty Cooke , and Zane Hawkins , have won over bar , nightclub and festival audiences across New Zealand . <p> " This album is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " shares Phoebe Johnson .

' Nigel ' is based on the gannet of the same name from Mana Island , off of the north west coast of New Zealand ( opposite Kapiti Island ) . Nigel was a lonely gannet selective about the friends he made , and refused to befriend any sea birds . Only a concrete gannet , that the Department of Conservation introduced , would Nigel hang out with .

" The song explores themes of grieving a chapter of your life , feeling behind , but also contentment in learning to accept loneliness . " <p> Taking cues from Talking Heads , Tom Tom Club , Jamiroquai , Steely Dan , Herbie Hancock , Minnie Ripperton and Prince , Revulva reimagines the anything-goes energy of New York City 's 1970s downtown scene and London 's 1990s funk and soul renaissance through an antipodean lens informed by the deadpan humour and the realities of 21st-century life in New Zealand . The result is a hedonistic whirlwind of acid jazz , avant-funk , disco , AOR and art-pop , where polished playing leaves room for improvisation in the heat of the moment , and real statements come bundled up with just enough laughs to soften the snarl . <p> To celebrate their self-titled album , releasing on October 11 , Revulva will play a nationwide tour this October and November . <p> REVULVA NZ ALBUM RELEASE TOUR <p> 31st October - Space Academy , Christchurch 1st November - Yours , Dunedin 2nd November - Secret Garden , Hawea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchase7th November - The Yard , Raglan9th November - Neck of the Woods , Auckland 16th November - Porridge Watson , Whanganui 23rd November - San Fran , Wellington* <p> Tickets are on sale from undertheradar.co.nz &amp; *Moshtix for Wellington <p> The album release is accompanied by a run of 200 records via Holiday Records ' new crowdfund campaign .

@@116255234 <h> We Are The Goodies ! Trotter 's Fantasy and Fanaticism . <p> " Are we the baddies ? " asks Chris Trotter in his latest From the Left column for The Democracy Project ( 17/10/2024 ) . He asks it of the New Zealand Left ( as a self-described " libertarian socialist " ) in connection with what he sees as their misguided perversion from liberalism towards a doctrinaire identarian and indigenised agenda broadly described as decolonisation . His columns on this subject are now so numerous they trail far off into the darkness , like so many tiki torches , it is difficult to say whether he 's marching to , or returning from , a burning cross . Indeed , in years gone by when his name came up in conversation around the Left wing traps the " level of intervention " meant his thoughts on the extent Government needed to reign in capitalists , but now when that phrase is mentioned we are referring to the extent he may need psychological assistance . Leave any three Lefties in a room for more than ten minutes and this subject will emerge -- always with a mix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Having recently re-read his ( excellent and recommended ) 2007 book on New Zealand 's political and social history , No Left Turn , the glimmer of those lights , and the darkness from which they emerge , were always there . The existential struggle of the European settler colonist in a Polynesian milieu was the framing just as much as the struggle between labour and capital was . The essential masculinity of the enterprise was throughout . The fetishisation of violence are not just present in graphic semi-fictionalised passages ( such as a rather turgid piece on ANZAC cove ) but daubed on almost every second page as a blood splatter motif to break sections . Not that the style is objectionable -- Peckinpah meets Tarantino can make for a gripping tale -- but the idea that political and social questions are best answered by Israeli amounts of overkill confirms his reactionary credentials . As such he is a literary gateway drug into the amphetamine psyche of the Right . <p> If the threat to the white settler colonisation project -- that is to say the colonisation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- is real and substantive ( if not irreversible ) then their fears are not merely paranoia and phobia they are concerns . How legitimate or justified those concerns are and how they are reconciled with what he calls the decolonisation project is the issue . The Act Party 's " Treaty Principles " Bill is the catalyst for this latest discussion , however it is fairly representative of the perennial concerns of the white settlers and serves as an adequate vehicle for their discontent in the current term of parliament . As such it is a situational , opportunistic , political gambit not wholly encompassing the spectrum of white settler angst ; but the visceral responses and polarisation tells us it is close enough of a proxy to be used both as a lens to focus and a prism to diffuse . <p> I will reply below to Trotter 's latest column with similarly unencumbered emotion , but hopefully also with more pointed facts with which to answer him . In particular his entire notion of comparing New Zealand with North versus South in the American Civil War is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favour this reply will be done methodically , paragraph by paragraph , in tandem with his column . <p> Does denying human equality and rejecting the principles of colour-blind citizenship place you among the baddies ? Yes , I 'm afraid it does . <p> This is so not what it seems when you see where he takes this ! <p> ' THE DEMON OF UNREST ' documents the descent of the United States into civil war . The primary focus of its author , Erik Larson , is the period of roughly five months between the election of Abraham Lincoln as President in November 1860 , and his inauguration in March 1861 . These were the months in which , one after the other , the slaveholding states of the South voted to secede from the Union . <p> Coincidentally New Zealand at this time faced a crisis of partition . These are also the months where the Second Anglo-Maori " Land " War began . The Waitara block was in dispute in 1860 with pressure from the Taranaki settlers to take it . The Governor at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neutral tribes at Mission Bay known as the Kohimarama Conference to isolate the Kingitanga and solidify Government support ( which was only partially successful ) . <p> Seldom has the evolution of an implacable political logic proceeded in circumstances where so few effective means of altering its direction lay to hand . Americans had become the prisoners of convictions that could not be set aside without incurring , to employ a key concept of the era , an irreparable loss of honour . <p> So too the British honour was at stake in New Zealand and so too the implacable settlers and their Government were on a collision course with the autonomous tribes of the central North Island . <p> Only a president of Lincoln 's strength and steadfastness could have won the American Civil War , but not even a president of Lincoln 's strength and steadfastness could have prevented it . <p> Gore Browne was victim to the settler 's rapacity and in 1861 the former Governor , Grey , was brought back for Kill Bill Volume 2 . <p> The most disconcerting feature of Larson 's historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the New Zealand of now . There are Kiwis , today , as committed to the decolonisation and indigenisation of their country as Yankees once were to the abolition of slavery . Likewise , there is an answering fraction of the New Zealand population every bit as determined to preserve the colour-blind conception of what it means to be a New Zealander as the slaveholders of the American South were determined to preserve their own " peculiar institution " . <p> Here Trotter draws back the bow to modern New Zealand -- but an assessment of the same time period is more productive to gather insight into how things have developed in this country . The transposing he attempts is assaultive : " colour-blind " is held up as an ideal -- but he equates it with ... the slaveholding South ! That is intellectually peculiar and certainly intellectually courageous . <p> The key historical question arising from this comparison is : which of the opposing sides in the present conflict between " New Zealand " and " Aotearoa " represents the North , and which the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would prefer to just look at what war New Zealand was undergoing while the Americans were having their war to figure out the two divergent strands of ideology of today that descend directly from that cleavage . His naming of the conflict as between " New Zealand " and " Aotearoa " I do agree with . " Aotearoa " ( being the name of the North Island ) was sewn onto a Kingitanga flag captured in the Waikato , and the memorials set up following the Land Wars by the Government states the soldiers " Died for New Zealand " . This is a good way of understanding the tension . <p> Superficially , it is the promoters of decolonisation and indigenisation who most resemble the Northern abolitionists . Certainly , in their moral certainty , dogmatism , and unwillingness to compromise , the Decolonisers and the Abolitionists would appear to be cut from identical cloth . Brought together by a time machine , one can easily imagine their respective leaders , so alike in their political style , getting along famously . <p> Superficially ? No , substantially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period of the early 1860s report that with the influx of British immigrants came a hostility towards them they had not experienced before -- these white settlers viewed Maori as an enemy and were conspiring to attack and subdue them . <p> By the same token , the defenders of Colour-Blind New Zealand , in their reverence for tradition and their deep nostalgia for the political certainties of the past , would appear to be a more than passable match for the political forces that gave birth to the Confederate States of America in 1861 . <p> " Colour-Blind " -- again that terminology is used without any provenance . It is an irksome and perverse inversion of reality . The same racists in the 1860s that were hating on Maori and coveting their lands are no different in essence to the racists of today hating on Maori and coveting their lands . The political certainties of the past and traditions he refers to is their racism . <p> These correspondences are , however , more apparent than real . From a strictly ideological standpoint , it is the Decolonisers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the streets of the South in 1860-61 , demanding secession and violently admonishing all those suspected of harbouring Northern sympathies . Likewise , it is the Indigenisers who preach a racially-bifurcated state in which the ethnic origin of the citizen is the most crucial determinant of his or her political rights and duties . <p> It is the European , the white settler , that makes the distinction between the Tangata Whenua and themselves a matter of " race " -- not Maori . Maori are the same race as their Rarotongan and Tahitian cousins , but each set of cousins respects the mana of each other in their own respective territory . Race and colour is a peculiarly European obsession . The bifurcated state was exactly what the Treaty envisaged : tribes were autonomous and the Crown controlled the lands alienated to the settlers . The whole country is under one Governor , but there are two systems operating . It was operating that way from day zero . It was the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852 ( UK ) that provided for " Maori Provinces " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historian Trotter can not project the prejudices he holds today back to this time period against the weight of the historical record , the evidence does not permit him to do this . <p> Certainly , in this country , the loudest clamour and the direst threats are directed at those who argue that New Zealand must remain a democratic state in which all citizens enjoy equal rights , irrespective of wealth , gender , or ethnic origin , and in which the property rights of all citizens are safeguarded by the Rule of Law . <p> No . No they are n't . Everyone wants what he describes including Maori nationalists and white liberal " identarians " so far as I can tell . Trotter 's deliberate confusion is to pretend that the Treaty and its guarantees to Maori of their autonomy and property rights is somehow not a law . It is n't even the first law of the land , it 's more than that : it 's law zero from year zero . Whether the Treaty can be ambulated into matters of Government policy and rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a live issue , but he makes no distinction so as to roll everything into his racial rubric . <p> These threats escalated alarmingly following the election of what soon became the National-Act-NZ First Coalition Government . Like the election of Lincoln in 1860 , the success of New Zealand 's conservative parties in the 2023 general election was construed by the Decolonisers and Indigenisers as a potentially fatal blow to any hope of sustaining and extending the gains made under the sympathetic , radical , and identity-driven Labour Government of 2020-23 . <p> Again with the threat rhetoric . Threat of what ? We wait a couple of years and maybe a less bigoted coalition assumes office . Such an anodyne state of affairs lacks the drama he seeks so he again draws an acute angle to something he says is a parallel . Everyone does not know that in 1960 the United Nations General Assembly passed a landmark resolution on Decolonisation proclaiming the process was inevitable and irreversable ; but everyone in New Zealand does know that this conservative cocktail of a coalition is nowhere near being a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing exactly what that resolution of 64 years ago foretells : decolonisation . <p> Just as occurred throughout the South in November and December of 1860 , the fire-eating partisans of " Aotearoa " lost little time in coming together to warn the incoming government that its political programme was unreasonable , unacceptable , and " racist " ; and that any attempt to realise it in legislation would be met with massive resistance -- up to and including civil war . <p> No source given for " civil war " . The only figure of any significance that speaks with any regularity of civil war is Trotter himself . His prophesising has been so inaccurate he ca n't even be rightfully called a Cassandra . Why have civil war when there 's a potential change of government in less than three years ( and currently less than two ) ? <p> The profoundly undemocratic nature of the fire-eaters ' opposition was illustrated by their vehement objections to the Act Party 's policy of holding a binding referendum to entrench , or not , the " principles " of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the first state to secede , the only votes they are willing to recognise are their own . <p> It 's funny how one 's own interests are rights that must be protected by law against the scourge of democratic mob rule ... and the rights and interests of those with a Treaty that might affect one 's presumption of rights suddenly just do n't mean anything . It is funny how that happens . <p> Another historical parallel is discernible in the degree to which the judicial arm of the New Zealand state , like its American counterpart in the 1850s , has actively supported the cause of ethnic difference in the 2020s . <p> The so-called parallels are now running at right angles across each other . The Treaty of Waitangi up until the racist 1877 " simple nullity " ruling from Chief Justice Prendergast was being abided by the judiciary . Once again discard the " ethnic " fixation and consider the parallels between the US ( and former British ) Treaties with the native American Indian tribes -- " sovereign " tribal nations -- and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own government administration , taxation , police , courts , drivers licences etc . Those tribal members , for example , can pass through the Canadian border using nothing more than their tribal ID . All of these bifurcated abominations occur , more or less , without any federal , state or judicial anxiety -- their Treaties are held inviolate . <p> In 1857 , the infamous Dred-Scott decision of the US Supreme Court advanced the cause of slavery throughout the United States . Written by Chief Justice Roger Taney , the judgement found that persons of African descent : " are not included , and were not intended to be included , under the word ' citizens ' in the Constitution , and can therefore claim none of the rights and privileges which that instrument provides for and secures to citizens of the United States " . The Taney Court 's decision made civil war inevitable . <p> This was more akin as their 1877 " simple nullity " decision . <p> In 2022 , the New Zealand Supreme Court 's adjudication of the Peter Ellis Case would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the application of New Zealand Law . The Court 's constitutionally dubious decision was intended to , and did , materially advance the establishment of a bi-cultural legal system in Aotearoa . It represented an historic victory for the Decolonisers . <p> Yes it was a victory of sorts to the cause , even though many of us raised an eyebrow at how tikanga can apply to a situation where the parties are all Pakeha . <p> It may occur to some readers , that the argument put forward here resembles the celebrated Mitchell &amp; Webb television sketch in which a worried SS officer asks his Nazi comrade-in-arms , Hans : " Are we the baddies ? " It 's a great line . But , over and above the humour , the writers are making an important point . Those who devote themselves entirely to a cause are generally incapable of questioning its moral status -- even when its uniforms are adorned with skulls . <p> It applies to you , Mr Trotter ! You stand there in the garb of Prendergast without a shred of self-awareness it seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe unquestioningly in the desirability of decolonisation and indigenisation argue passionately that they are part of the same great progressive tradition that inspired the American Abolitionists of 160 years ago . But are they ? <p> Yes . Yes they are . Trotter the contrarian has four remaining paragraphs to at least start to make his case because there has been no detectable argument thus far . <p> Did the Black Abolitionist , and former slave , Frederick Douglass , embrace the racial essentialism of Moana Jackson ? Or did he , rather , wage an unceasing struggle against those who insisted , to the point of unleashing a devastating civil war , that all human-beings are not created equal ? <p> Hate the double negative -- it usually belies a contorted logic , as it does here . The " racial essentialism " is spurious , it is being used to argue against a Treaty position not founded essentially on race . <p> What is there that in any way advances the progressive cause about the casual repudiation of Dr Martin Luther King Jnr 's dream that : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the colour of their skin , but by the content of their character " ? <p> Trotter seems to take great alacrity to his mission of poking the kittens at the petting zoo in their eyes with a sharp stick . At this stage the comments are barely worthy of a serious response . <p> When will the partisans of decolonisation and indigenisation finally notice the death 's head on their caps ? That , driven by their political passion to atone for the sins of the colonial fathers , they are willing to subvert the Rule of Law , deny human equality , misrepresent their country 's history , and abandon its democratic system of government . Can they not see that the people they castigate as the direct ideological descendants of the slaveholding white supremacists of the antebellum South , are actually fighting for the same principles that animated and inspired the Northern Abolitionists ? <p> If it 's sarcasm it 's comedy gold , but if he 's being serious ? " Can they not see ... " -- it does sound like he 's written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rejecting the principles of colour-blind citizenship place you among the baddies ? Yes , I 'm afraid it does .

The demon of gin and across-the-counter pseudoephedrine appears to have claimed another Trotter column . <h> 7 COMMENTS <p> i ca n't help thinking you have given Trotter more attention than he deserves . However , the subject he writes on does deserve attention . To me it is simple . I believe in the Treaty and Article 2 promised that maori could retain their land , estates etc. for so long as they wished . Until all of the land which was confiscated in Taranaki is returned to the hapu of Te Atiawa and Taranaki and so forth then the Treaty is still breached . The land is still stolen . In the coming week or so a random person will win over $30 million in Lotto . This is more than many iwi received as a so called settlement for the theft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Government still holds toward Maori . <p> It 's all technocracy and temu these days . Decolonisation seems to be a handy road for a detour around the practical issues ( eg. fuel contamination and engine failure ) . There is a hidden tunnel which goes to the washroom in the beehive called local council and there 's no wifi signal so no updates . <p> The problem is simple to explain . The solution to the problem is impossible to impliment . It 's all about the money . Nothing else . 50,000 farmers earn AO/NZ 's money and 5,150000 spend it and everything else might have been art , except it is n't . It would n't be so bad if the money sequestered from farmers was n't trapped up the 14 multi-billionaires and the 3118 multi-millionaires . The farmer earned finances quandry has made banking here the second most profitable banking in the world and our few urban scum bags here are some of the richest . graeme hart , for example , is one of the 200 richest in the world . How ? Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your fingers out and started making your own inquiries . But what do farmers do ? My advice would be to sell up and retire early and let fuckers go broke then starve . AO/NZ is in an extraordinary position . Intellectuals can intellectualise and philosophers can philosophise but financiers will run out of money and you will soon starve to death . Our farmlands are now grassy paddocks with little or no stock and freezing works are closing so there goes our primary industry so who cares what Chris Trotter or anyone else says or does . We 're fucked . I mean we 're really , really , really fucked . Solution ... Given our greedy , pathetic goverance both past and present I do n't think there is one . You 're fucked . What do you think adern ? <p> Forgot to mention three obscure points that are historically relevant to Trotter 's American Civil War examination : <p> 1 . The British , and NZ , were generally pro-Confederacy . ( Being anti-slavery I take it their support was to do with splitting their rival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but ? ) . <p> 2 . In Hansard ( I think it was 1865 ) it is recorded in a debate in the House that a letter had been received from the US Government stating they see the NZ colonial government can not win the war with Maori and offering to send their military to subdue them in return for becoming a US state . The letter was met with laughter in the chamber according to Hansard and the MPs responded that they had the war under control ( they did n't -- the British forces had to remain well after their withdrawal date because it was not under control with Te Kooti especially ) . <p> 3 . Not a convenient fact to recite , but for historical accuracy I must note it : the " Indian Territory " ( now Oklahoma ) where the displaced tribes from the East were herded had slavery and joined the Confederacy and was I think the last place to surrender to the North . There are no parallels with the Kingitanga or the situation in NZ however -- there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1860s . Instances of prisoners being kept in slave-like conditions are to be found on both sides however . There was at least one incident in the Land Wars when Kupapa soldiers tried to take the women of defeated tribes as a war prize but the European officers put a stop to it from what I recall . <p> Colonisation is a foreign system of cultural power instituted on unwilling people , subjugating their persons and cultures . When the influx on 10s of thousands of British settlers flooded in and used their power to breach the treaty , they put Aotearoa under colonial rule . " But we 're all free &amp; colour blind under the law in this super peaceful and equal society " simply does not even begin to engage with the reality . We should be proud of the fact that decolonisation began with the Waitangi Tribunal , and all interested and engged in where it could take us as a society . A Maori worldview has a lot to offer the binary control and dominate disease that inflicts Western society , and the runt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maori institutions flourish and develop organically , as they were , as they will continue to . I know most people are feeling insecure about jobs , money the world , but that is BECAUSE of the Western quest to control and dominate and how that has shaped our corporatist capitalist society , and did n't the " pandemic " show how they can whip us so ( but not the united iwi who quietly dissented ) . It ai n't because the iwi are getting some of their bikkies back out of our back pocket . t is the structure of our society as is , and the nature of the few people who benefit from it that are the problem . THey 're just pointing " look , racist separatists " to distract us all from the ones that have been raking it in for decades , and continue to rake it in.

FPAs could be a compulsory bottom line for all migrant workers . I am all for union membership , but we have to have the resources and will to enforce real change . Those migrant workers who were employed by Darleen Tana 's husband for example . They have tried to enforce the law through our current system and the e bike business has gone into liquidation . Those workers will never be paid .

Workers are expected to go from job to job and start all over again with each employer . RSE workers ca n't even go to another job . The only difference is where there are union agreements like in the Meat Industry , but even then , they are tenuous and do n't go between employers . 
@@116255236 <h> BEN MORGAN : Russian manoeuvre offensive culminating ? <p> Since the last update , the land campaign has remained relatively static , both sides locked in an attritional struggle . In the north , near Kursk , Russia is making limited progress trying to reduce the Ukrainian salient . Meanwhile , Pokrovsk remains in Ukrainian hands , along with other key towns like Chasiv Yar . Across the frontline my key observation is that the campaign is stagnating , neither side able to achieve manoeuvre , instead fighting an attritional campaign . <p> However , the ground campaign 's lack of movement provides useful insight into Russia 's strategic predicament . Putin appears over-extended as experts point to the war 's strain on Russia 's economy and its once feared military needs North Korean help to maintain the war effort . <p> Meanwhile , more details of Ukraine 's victory plan were made public , after President Zelensky briefed his nation 's parliament . Although , the details are still sparse the plan provides more insight into Ukraine 's strategic planning . <p> Ukraine 's victory plan <p> Last week , President Zelensky briefed Ukraine 's parliament on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Increasing Ukraine 's military capabilities so that it can defend itself , specifically providing more long-range precision-guided missiles without restrictions , so that it can defeat Russia . <p> Strategic economic partnerships between Ukraine , the US and other supporters to build the nation 's economy . Ukraine 's partners receiving access to the nation 's natural resources in exchange for their investment . <p> Post-war Ukraine becomes a member of NATO , its recent experience and soldiers helping to strengthen the alliance . <p> The President 's speech did not provide a lot of detail , but certainly indicates Ukraine 's position . It needs the support of the US and Europe to secure long-term peace . That Ukraine is clearly planning for a long period of post-war hostility with Russia , and is therefore seeking NATO membership to secure its borders after any peace treaty is agreed . The likelihood of NATO offering Ukraine membership while the war is being fought is practically zero , because it would immediately bring the alliance into direct conflict with Russia . <p> President Zelensky 's thinking is more short-term when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech , he said leaders in the US , Germany , France and the UK understand the request . My assessment is that he envisages a comprehensive air-defence system like Israel 's ' Iron Dome , ' backed by long-range missiles like Tomahawk that can accurately engage targets deep inside Russia with large explosive payloads . A system that the President believes can make fighting Ukraine prohibitively expensive , compelling Russia to negotiate . <p> An important point because President Zelensky 's plan does not involve any loss of Ukrainian territory to Russia . It does not seek to compromise or to bargain , instead the plan 's objectives are to build Ukraine 's military and economic capability to the point that Russia is forced to concede . At which point peace will be secured in the long-term , by NATO membership . <p> Essentially , the plan does not put new ideas on the table but is a clear statement of Ukraine 's intent to fight until Russia is defeated . <p> North Korean troops in Ukraine <p> The deployment of North Korean troops in Ukraine has recently been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3,000 North Korea soldiers were preparing to join Russia 's 11th Airborne Brigade . On 17 October , Ukraine 's General Kyrylo Budanov , the head of Ukraine 's Military Intelligence Directorate ( GUR ) stated that 11,000 North Koreans are in the process of being deployed to Ukraine . Then on 18 October . South Korea 's National Intelligence Service indicated that roughly 1,500 North Korean special forces soldiers are in Russia conducting pre-deployment training for operations in Ukraine . <p> Many commentators are exercised by this development , often interpreting this activity as part of a larger trend towards global conflict . This view is unlikely to be correct , North Korea stands to gain considerably from supporting Russia but is unlikely to be forging an alliance ready for World War Three . Instead , North Korea is certain to be getting some benefit , for instance tech support or new military hardware . Supporting Russia probably also inflates the ego of Kim Jong Un , who by doing so elevates his position internationally by coming to Putin 's aid . Additionally , since North Korea 's military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an opportunity to develop military skills and test equipment . <p> The impact of North Korean troops on the battlefield will be minimal , their key contribution to the war effort will be allowing Putin to put off national mobilisation for a little longer . North Korean soldiers are poorly trained as well as having archaic equipment , so it is unlikely they will be very effective in combat . Probably , they will suffer high casualties and may start to surrender or defect relatively quickly . <p> The operational-level situation <p> At operational-level the 300-km-long see-saw battle continues , Russia trying to capture all of Donetsk in the east , while Ukraine aims to draw forces away by attacking in the north near Kursk . <p> Currently , at operational-level the ground campaign is stagnating and turning into a battle of will , both sides engaging in positional fighting and trading small amounts of ground for high casualties . In campaign terms , this situation is a win for Ukraine because it is inflicting attrition on Russia without losing ground . A situation that indicates their casualties are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's preference for limiting casualties this is an indication that losses are sustainable . <p> The weather in Ukraine is starting to turn , and autumnal rain is being reported . This means that we are soon likely to see a brief respite in the campaign as both sides take advantage of the weather to rest and reconstitute their forces . It will provide a time for reflection ; revaluation , and we should expect changes in campaign strategy when the ground freezes in February . <p> Tactical-level fighting <p> Kursk <p> In the north , near Kursk , a difficult battle has raged over the last two weeks . Russia is believed to have committed roughly 50,000 new soldiers to this sector , and is trying to envelop the tip of Ukraine 's foothold , an area near the town of Korenevo . See the map below , Russia has developed its initial spoiling attack that stopped Ukraine reaching Korenevo and the Syem River and has preserved a corridor to withdraw forces trapped south of the river . <p> After making the spoiling attack , some Russian forces advanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the north to cut off Ukrainian soldiers near Korenevo . Since then , this battle has flowed back and forth , with Ukraine vigorously counter attacking . <p> This fighting continues to sway back and forth , and as this article was written , Russia did not appear to be able to complete the envelopment . The most noteworthy feature of this tactical battle is its impact on the operational-level campaign , because it is likely to draw more Russian troops away from battles elsewhere . <p> Pokrovsk <p> Like other areas on the frontline , fighting around Pokrovsk has been positional in the last few weeks . In early September , I predicted that Russia would not take Pokrovsk . ( See ; Pokrovsk , it looks like General Syrskyi has bad news for Russia ) and as winter approaches , this assessment is being confirmed . <p> Russia maintain pressure in this area but is clearly avoiding a direct attack from the east , its forces ' propping , ' static while they wait for the situation to evolve . Instead of advancing west towards Pokrovsk they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and are probing south , looking for a way around the town . Russia 's recent activity is focussed on the area south of Selydove . This turn of events is predictable because immediately east of Pokrovsk is a large , low-lying bowl of open country that creates an excellent engagement area for the Ukrainian defenders . The nature of the ground means that Russia would require significant resources to advance directly west into Pokrovsk . <p> The fact that Russian forces are not moving west indicates that Russia does not have the resources to advance through the engagement area and take Pokrovsk . An assessment supported by recent successful local Ukrainian attacks near Hordivka and Novohrodivka , that were reported by the Institute for the Study of War on 17 October and confirmed by geo-located video footage . Successful small attacks in these areas demonstrate that Russian forces near Pokrovsk are tired and weaker than they need to be to advance on the town . <p> Russian planners may see this as a temporary situation , accepting a natural lull in tempo while they prepare forces for mid-winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the summer . However , it may also be that Russian manpower and equipment shortages impacting and the offensive has culminated . <p> What fighting in other areas tells us about the campaign <p> Along the frontline there are other areas that are experiencing combat including : <p> Vuledhar . <p> Parts of Zaporizhia , particularly near Orikhiv and Velyka Novasilika . <p> Kupyansk . <p> Chasiv Yar . <p> Toretsk . <p> Vovchansk . <p> This fighting provides more information about Russia 's current situation . For instance , two weeks ago Russia captured the fortress town of Vuledhar . The town is situated on high ground dominating its local area , about 50 km south of Pokrovsk . After its capture there has been very limited Russian forward movement . Additionally , Ukraine successfully counter-attacked and regained territory near Torestsk on 15 October . Both situations are noteworthy because they indicate Russia lacks soldiers in reserve , either to counter attack or to take advantage of the loss of Vuledhar . <p> Summary <p> The last two weeks contained some impressive headlines , about Ukraine 's victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on them though , it seems that the biggest story currently is that Russia appears to be culminating . Russia 's forward progress is reducing and contrary to recent historic precedent Ukraine is achieving small offensive victories . <p> Holding Russia is a victory for Ukraine , every step Russia advances takes enormous amounts of blood and treasure . Commodities that are limited even in Russia , and in the Kremlin , there will be an inevitable stocktake when the rain comes , and fighting must stop for the year . Russia has failed to take Pokrovsk , its advance in Donetsk is painfully slow and Ukraine continues to occupy about 1100 square km of Russian territory . <p> Meanwhile , Ukraine continues to maintain the pressure forcing Russia to pay dearly for every metre of ground it takes and its European partners are ramping up their support .

@@117223230 <p> After the Black Caps swept India 3-0 in a historic test series , the Herald grades the performance of the squad . <h> Tom Latham <p> 145 runs at average of 24.2 <p> Should Latham resign the test captaincy ? It 's all downhill from here . On the other hand , maybe New Zealand will never loseagain . In any case , the 32-year-old certainly seemed suited to the fulltime role during his maiden series , largely nailing his bowling options and reviews ( with one notable exception that almost left the skipper with his Pants down ) while sweeping his way to a crucial innings of 86 in Pune . <h> Devon Conway <p> 227 runs at average of 37.8 <p> Conway will head home having banished the poor run of form that plagued much of his previous year . Fifties to start the first and second matches made it three half-centuries in a span of four test innings , both setting the tone as his side earned first-innings leads . The opener 's 91 in Bengaluru was a particularly fine knock and one that deserved a hundred , a milestone Conway remained without since January @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Replacing the most consistent batter this country has produced , Young made it all appear rather easy . With a lowest score of 18 and highest of 71 , the No 3 could generally be counted on when the tourists were hoping to establish match-winning platforms . Young also delivered a match-winning innings in the first test , notching an unbeaten 48 while seeming as relaxed as he would be playing club cricket . Kane Williamson now has big shoes to fill when England visit . <h> Rachin Ravindra <p> 256 runs at average of 51.2 <p> Ravindra was dismissed for single figures in half his innings on tour and still led the Black Caps in runs and average . Such was his impressive opening to the series , beginning in Bengaluru with 134 -- the best knock of his young career -- and backing up with a nerveless 39no in what could have become a tricky chase . The 64 he added on a challenging track in Pune was the fourth-highest score of the match . <p> Mark : A <h> Daryl Mitchell <p> 157 runs at average of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , heading to Mumbai mired in the type of drought that seemed beneath a player who had transformed himself into the best New Zealand batter not named Kane . And then , in the first innings at Wankhede , life looked more difficult than it had ever been . But Mitchell battled heat in the high 30s that caused cramp and exhaustion to register an invaluable 82 , an innings without which the tourists would have been defeated . <h> Tom Blundell <p> 53 runs at average of 10.6 <p> Blundell 's form at the crease is troubling given the team 's insistence on his spot at No 6 ; two more failures in the third test dropped his average to 14 in his past 13 matches . Which means it 's fortunate he remains exemplary behind the stumps -- back in the olden days all that was required of wicketkeepers . And the 34-year-old at least played one innings of note in the series , chipping in with 41 to reinforce the Black Caps ' control of the second test . <p> Mark : A <h> Glenn Phillips <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average of 35.1 <p> A gem to have at No 7 , Phillips continued in this series what he has consistently done since being recalled to the test side at the end of last year : scoring valuable runs and adding critical wickets . The allrounder struck in each of the five innings he was required , with his 3-42 to conclude the tour offering essential support to Ajaz Patel , while knocks of 48no and 26 off 14 showed he could supply quick runs with the tail in any conditions . <p> Mark : A <h> Mitchell Santner <p> 13 wickets at average of 12.1 ; 37 runs at average of 18.5 <p> It 's understandable that Santner suffered a side strain during the second-test victory ; he was undoubtedly ailed by carrying the team on his back . With the pitch turning from the first day and Patel proving ineffective throughout , there was only one way the Black Caps would achieve even parity -- let alone beat the hosts -- in Pune . Santner , having never exceeded three wickets in an innings , had to produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowler . And he did . <h> Ish Sodhi <p> 1 wicket at average of 36 ; 15 runs at average of 7.5 <p> Sodhi was at home during test one , on the sidelines for test two and used sparingly in test three . And yet , he earned his place in the celebrations by snagging one of the most decisive wickets . Before almost winning the game in the second innings , Rishabh Pant was batting the Black Caps out of the game in the first , scoring 60 from 59 in a match-high fifth-wicket stand of 96 . Sodhi 's lbw put an end to that . <p> Mark : A <h> Tim Southee <p> 3 wickets at average of 31.1 ; 70 runs at average of 23.3 <p> The former skipper is now riding a 10-test streak of being restricted to two or fewer wickets . But Southee managed to contribute in both the first and second test , before being omitted for the first time since winning the World Test Championship . His efforts in Bengaluru were especially important , starting the first-innings carnage with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Rachin Ravindra that the ascendant tourists still needed . <p> Mark : A <h> Matt Henry <p> 10 wickets at average of 15.3 ; 18 runs at average of 6 <p> Henry might have changed nothing about a 2-0 defeat on the spinning pitches of Sri Lanka . But , boy , it might have been a good idea to give him a chance . New Zealand 's best seamer reaffirmed that status and celebrated his recall by claiming 5-15 in the first innings of the opener , rolling India for their lowest home score in test history . Henry added three more in the second innings and , having recovered from injury , picked up two key wickets at Wankhede . <p> Mark : A <h> Ajaz Patel <p> 15 wickets at average of 23.8 ; 24 runs at average of 4.8 <p> Three years after a test he would never forget , Patel 's return to India had been largely forgettable . The 36-year-old collected two scalps in 18 overs in Bengaluru , then two more in 23 in Pune . But it was n't a return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his birthplace Mumbai . Half the spinner 's eight best bowling figures have been registered at Wankhede and his tally of 25 wickets are the most by any visitor at one Indian venue . <p> Mark : A <h> Will O'Rourke <p> 7 wickets at average of 18.4 ; 3 runs at average of 3 <p> O'Rourke played virtually as a designated fielder in the second and third matches , bowling six overs combined while confirming he would bat at No 12 if he could . But in what has become a trend in this report card -- and in what was the single deciding factor in a 3-0 scoreline -- the 23-year-old chimed in with one performance pivotal to a victory , complementing Henry with seven wickets on the surprisingly seam-friendly track in Bengaluru.

It means doing everything we can to keep our pets happy , healthy , and safe , while preventing them from causing harm to our natural environment and the community . <p> By taking the time to learn about what it means to be a responsible pet owner we can ensure our pets , native plants and animals all have the space they need to thrive and survive . Want to make sure you 're playing your part ? Here 's what it means to be a superstar owner of some of our more obscure types of pets : <p> If you want to test your knowledge of exotic pets and how to care for them , try out our quiz here . <h> Fish <p> Pet owners may think their goldfish will love the freedom of a large stream or pond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but doing this causes ecological mayhem . Releasing exotic fish into waterways upsets natural ecosystems , by forcing native species to compete for habitat , degrading water quality , introducing parasites and disease , and depleting native insects , fish eggs and plants . What 's worse : they can breed quickly , making pet fish difficult to get rid of once they are established . <p> The good news is that avoiding this mayhem is easy . All you have to do is keep pet fish well away from waterways , which means never releasing them into the wild and , if you have an outdoor pond , ensuring it is securely contained . <p> If you can no longer care for your fish , it 's important to find a new owner , return it to the pet store or find a fish rehoming group on Facebook . Releasing exotic fish also raises serious welfare issues . Pets are used to being fed daily by their owners and kept in safe enclosures ; they are ill-equipped to survive in the wild . It 's a bit like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multitude of dangers from hungry predators to harsh environmental conditions . Pets released into waterways are likely to suffer from malnutrition , injuries , and stress . <h> Birds <p> Much like fish , pet birds can upset the delicate ecosystem when released into the wild . Unlike fish , they fly , meaning escapees are common . <p> Once they 're lost from home , pet birds can impact native species , especially native parrots such as kakariki and kaka , by introducing diseases and taking away food resources and places to nest . <p> To prevent this , a responsible bird owner needs to ensure their birds are always securely contained and provide enough space and quality food to meet their behavioural needs . If you 're no longer able to look after your pet bird , try to find someone else who can give it a long-term home or look for a bird rescue centre . <p> Research from the University of Auckland estimates there are on average 491 pet birds on the loose in Auckland in any given month , particularly in summer when owners are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bird owners might think their pet wo n't escape or will always find its way home , but the statistics say otherwise .

What many people do n't realise is that they can grow to the size of dinner plates , leading many turtle-owners to find themselves out of their depth as their pets no longer fit in home aquariums . <p> When this happens , many owners think they 're doing their pet a favour by setting it free outdoors . Unfortunately , this can be dangerous for the turtle as well as the environment . As omnivores , turtles eat a wide variety of aquatic plants as well as fish , baby birds , insects , lizards and frogs , putting more strain on an already stressed ecosystem . <p> The first step to being a responsible turtle owner is to realise that turtles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 years ! ) , and to think carefully about whether you can handle one , once it 's fully-grown . Keeping turtles securely contained is a must , and if you can no longer care for them , then try to find a new owner , or take them to a turtle rescue centre or turtle haven . <p> Our waterbodies are already under pressure and red-eared slider turtles are notorious for escaping , with the dubious honour of being one of the world 's top 100 worst pests . If we act now , and prevent the release of unwanted turtles into waterways , we may still have an opportunity to prevent exotic turtles being too prevalent in the future . <h> Lizards <p> Lizards are not your usual pet , not one you would immediately think about buying ; they are not for the faint-hearted as they are expensive , require a specific living enclosure and have an average lifespan of 20 years . <p> But some people are enamoured with lizards , until they 're not . <p> Escaped exotic lizards are becoming increasingly common as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Auckland . <p> Many of the species available here feel quite at home in our climate and could readily establish invasive populations if allowed to escape or if they are released into the wild . <p> Allowing these animals to escape , or dumping them , puts these pets at risk of harm . Exotic lizards also pose a risk to our indigenous species , spreading diseases , eating insects , and competing with our beautiful native lizards . <p> So , if you own a lizard and can no longer take care of it , be kind to it and contact an exotic animal rescue . <p> And a big thank you to all those pet owners who are playing their part to make Tamaki Makaurau a great place for pets , the community and native wildlife .

Managing those areas has highlighted some of the practical issues that have to be overcome to incorporate regenerative practices into a cropping rotation . These include issues like establishing consistent sources of compost free of weed seeds and other contaminants , managing the timing of termination and decomposition of cover crops , and crop health issues related to choice of cover crop .

But , at 69 , he is a leading warrior in the cultural war against academic ideologies that downgrade the Enlightenment values of Western civilisation in favour of critical theory , indigenisation , and decolonisation . <p> For most of his career , Biggar led a quiet life studying and teaching Christian theology in the UK , Canada , United States , and Ireland . In 2007 , he was appointed Regius Professor of Moral and Pastoral Theology at the University of Oxford . <p> He was ordained as an Anglican priest in 1991 and became a canon of Christ Church Cathedral , Oxford . His books included several with ethics in their title . His conservatism was reflected in a justification for the use of violence against repression , In Defence of War ( 2013 ) , and denying the existence of natural rights , What 's Wrong with Rights ? ( 2020 ) . <p> His warrior status was earned in 2017 when he launched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediate condemnation from historians and academics who equated imperialism with an extensive list of sins , ranging from genocide and slavery to colonialism and racial subjugation . <p> These scholars rejected the tradition of the Enlightenment and its basis in scientific rationalism , capitalism , and universal rights as inherently immoral and reflective of white supremacy . Their thesis was a reinterpretation of how Western capitalism spread throughout the world from the late 18th and 19th centuries . <h> Moral perspective <p> That Biggar was challenging this view from a moral perspective was too much for someone such as Dr ( now Professor ) Priyamvada Gopal of Cambridge University and later author of Insurgent Empire : Anti-Colonial Resistance and British Dissent ( 2019 ) . <p> She texted her colleagues : " OMG . This is serious shit ... We need to SHUT THIS DOWN .

It 's one of how an academic cancellation backfired . <p> As he tells it , Oxford 's establishment held steady -- where many others have n't -- and his research project ran its full five-year term . The attempt to ' shut this down ' produced its own backlash . <p> A publisher , Bloomsbury , commissioned an " intelligent person 's guide to colonialism " based on Biggar 's research . He completed it but was then told that " public feeling was unfavourable " to publication . Biggar soon found another publisher , HarperCollins , which released it in February last year as Colonialism : A Moral Reckoning . <h> Academics rally <p> Conservative and pro-free speech academics rallied to his cause , partially thanks to publicity in the right-leaning section of the British mass media : The Daily Telegraph , The Times , and TheDaily Mail . <p> Sympathetic historians formed an association , History Reclaimed , with members from throughout the world . Its website has three New Zealanders on its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oxford ) , and AUT 's Paul Moon , as well as the late Michael King . <p> Another outcome was the free speech movement , launched in the UK by Spectator columnist Toby Young in February 2020 .

They focus on legal cases as well as entrenching rights to freedom of speech for teachers and students in universities . They also oppose governments passing ' hate speech ' laws . <p> At the FSU meeting in Auckland , as well as in appearances at Wellington and Christchurch , Biggar had little opportunity to discuss the content of Colonialism : A Moral Reckoning , which to my knowledge had no exposure here on its first release . <p> It now has an updated edition that runs to nearly 600 pages , including a 70-page postscript , in which Biggar responds to his severest critics , among them supporters of Gopal 's ' shut this down ' campaign . Biggar 's reply increases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contain some of the best content ) , and a rich bibliography of 33 pages . <h> Race and violence <p> Critics of Biggar and others who challenge the anti-colonial view emphasise the role of race and violence along with economic exploitation and land seizure . This was the case in New Zealand , as well as in North America , Africa , India , and Australia where the British Empire had its biggest impact . <p> Biggar responds by accusing his critics of exaggerating or distorting the evidence and applying judgments based on modern-day sensibilities rather than those prevailing at the time . He accuses them of adopting a higher moral ground , which makes them vulnerable to seeing only the worst in people of their own kind -- something he calls " Christian degeneracy " . <p> While this has some virtue in recognising sin , it also contains the seeds of vice , he warns .

At the centre of the imperial project was the idea that all societies could advance if given the right tools for development . <p> Francois-Auguste Biard 's painting of the proclamation of the end of slavery in the French colonies in 1848 . <h> No centralised power <p> The British Empire , like the Roman one before it , lacked centralised power until modern forms of communication were invented leading up to World War I. These enabled the empire to draw on support from its colonies against the combined forces of Germany , Austria-Hungary , and Ottoman Turkey . <p> The use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of exploitation is more complicated than simple explanations of conquest or appropriation . In America , Africa , and Australia , indigenous tribes fought over land before and after the first migrants arrived . <p> " Population movements were not caused by aboriginal people losing their own lands to white settlers , but by taking advantage of new technology European guns secured through trade , " Canadian historian Tom Flanagan noted in First Nations ? Second Thoughts ( 2008 ) . <p> The record shows land was seized by colonial authorities as retribution , in places such as Tasmania , South Africa , and New Zealand . Biggar challenges revisionist views that colonised tribes never intended their land to be alienated only to " share " it -- ignorance of British ways was no defence , as tribes treated land conquest in the same manner . <p> Accusations of genocide are commonly applied to the past to label events from famines to cultural assimilation .

@@117835235 <h> On The Hikoi Aftermath <p> The euphoria from yesterday 's hikoi may be transitory , but is no less valuable for that . It is pretty rare for the left to feel itself to be in the overwhelming majority , and speaking as the voice of the people . Lest that momentum be lost , the organisers will no doubt be mobilising the contacts they made yesterday , to carry the ongoing fight against this Bill to all parts of the country . ( In business speak , the hikoi was a great networking opportunity . ) <p> The subsequent nit-picking among the Bill 's fellow travellers was a good indication of just how rattled they were by the massive turnout . Teachers can be grinches , so it probably was appropriate that Education Minister Erica Stanford did her best to treat yesterday 's gigantic march on Parliament as merely some untoward rumpus at the back of the classroom . Amusingly , Stanford thought the hikoi had lacked an essential educational component : <p> Stanford said if schools were holding an " education-outside the classroom " activity , they needed to ensure it had a literacy and numeracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of her Cabinet colleagues clearly could do with some remedial tuition on their own " numeracy dimensions .

All by himself , Peters had apparently been at the side of the road with a calculator as the march went by : <p> Peters ... said he had seen far bigger protests , such as the Springbok Tour . He cast doubt on police 's attendance figures of 35,000 , saying he put it closer to 22,000 maximum . <p> Not both of them can be right .

So where was Erica Stanford 's voice of disapproval when the America 's Cup squad went on a nationwide tour earlier this year , " visiting 39 schools , yacht clubs , and Toyota vehicle dealerships along the way .

The eventual voting down of the Bill will be an anti-climax . By then , Seymour will have banked massive amounts of public attention , and won a ton of gratitude from the kind of reactionaries who think Maori have had it too good for too long . <p> Yesterday , Seymour was claiming that the hikoi was " not representative " of public opinion .

If anyone is not representative of New Zealand public opinion , it is David Seymour .

Peaceful mass protests against Israel 's atrocities in Gaza and Lebanon have also had no effect , either on Israel or on its US sponsors . <p> Some would also query the " peaceful " requirement .

Instead , the prime value seems to be internal , in re-assuring and inspiring people that other people -- tens of thousands of them -- think and feel roughly the same way about the state of things . ( Those in power spend a lot of time and money to convince ordinary people that they are isolated , and impotent . ) <p> The regular weekly protests held against Israel 's actions in Gaza and Lebanon -- and against New Zealand joining AUKUS -- serve much the same internal morale-boosting purpose , even if the course of events seems entirely pre-determined .

For that reason , there 's one historical example to the contrary that may be worth keeping in mind . It dates back to a protest demonstration held in Wellington in 1967 during the Vietnam war era . At the time , then US Defence Minister Clark Clifford and Pentagon general Maxwell Taylor were touring the region , trying to drum up regional support for the American anti-communist crusade in Vietnam . <p> Clifford later wrote in his memoirs that the Wellington demonstration had made him realise ... that if Vietnam 's democratic neighbours in the Asia Pacific were not all that worried about the region falling under communist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and treasure in this unwelcome/unappreciated cause ? <p> Probably everyone who 'd been at the Wellington demonstration outside Clifford 's hotel had gone home that night feeling their efforts had been in vain .

" <p> OT should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led up to the event and what staff did to reduce the possibility of seclusion being used , Achmad said . <p> " We are very clear , as is the UN , that there should be zero use of seclusion for children and young people . So when it is used , it is extremely serious and there should be appropriate and adequately documented information about going in , and coming out of secure care . " <p> Achmad believed a lack of qualified or trained staff working in these facilities contributed to the poor record-keeping . <p> The report was a follow-up to a highly critical report in 2017 . The 2020 report found little had changed , with Oranga Tamariki noting at the time " the continued need for IT investment to improve the ability to analyse incident records " . <p> Children were being put into seclusion just for making threats , the HRC found . <p> " Only a small minority of children appear to have actually done something , rather than make threats . The length of stay attached to each reasoning appeared almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure placement was meant to achieve , " the report said . <p> The report also raised concerns then about the way data was being collated , with some residences resorting to pen and paper as there was no way to record data digitally . <p> Independent Children 's Monitor chief executive Arran Jones said the lack of data on seclusion and restraint practices meant watchdogs like his and Mana Mokopuna could not determine if things had improved since 2020 . <p> " The data that Oranga Tamariki provides us with is n't as comprehensive as you would like , " he said . <p> " Its usefulness is limited because it does n't have the necessary granularity . So you ca n't see , for example , in the data , how those rates of the use of secure and restraint compared to the size of the population . <p> " That 's the stuff that 's really important to see so you can understand whether you have it being overly used in a particular facility or not .

But these were often incomplete , Claire Achmad said . <p> " They often have sections that are blank or information that is outdated , so that has a practical impact on the care of children in residence . <p> " When information is missing , left off or outdated , that means residence staff are having to essentially learn on the fly about that person . It 's a concern . " <p> The issue had existed for more than a year and while OT had assured her it would rectify these " gaps " , the pace of change was " not as swift as I 'd like it to be , " Achmad said . <p> " The information that you know about children and young people in state care is of such importance to their care and their wellbeing in the care of the state . " <p> Poor records led to some children being held on remand for longer than they needed , she said . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're being based on inadequate information that 's not taking a specific look at the individual child situation . " <p> A child on remand should have their remand reviewed every 14 days by a social worker , but that was not always happening , Achmad said . <p> " You see that playing out in terms of children and young people being held on remand for significantly long periods of time in residences . " <p> At least 10 teenagers spent more than 200 days remanded in a youth justice facility , including two who spent more than 500 days on remand , according to 2022/23 figures . <p> In addition , serious event notifications were often not written until days after the event had happened , and sometimes reports of concerns for children involved in that event were not being filed at all , Achmad said . <p> A 2023 rapid review of youth justice facilities by former police commissioner Mike Bush , found ' All About Me ' plans were " inconsistent in terms of accuracy , completeness and currency .

A $62.5 million upgrade is underway but will take about six years to complete . <p> The Bush review found there was wide variation in record-keeping and the use of evidence-based practices in OT residences . <p> " We visited community homes in which staff had made up their own spreadsheets and folders for children because they felt they could not rely on ' the system ' to provide it for them , " the review noted . <p> It recommended the development of standard plans , the use of quality metrics , and more training for staff . <p> These concerns were not new , however . <p> Chief Ombudsman Peter Boshier told RNZ he had " pretty deep concerns " about care plans during visits to care facilities he was the Principal Family Court Judge in 201 . <p> " Sometimes the care plan had in it that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , and they were still there , and no one quite knew why , " he said . <p> " Sometimes the plan had set out in it that these were the steps to be taken to reintegrate this particular person into a new home or community setting that had n't happened and we did n't know why . " <p> Boshier said he was not surprised it was still an issue more than a decade later , because he believed the organisation lacked discipline and a strong culture when it came to record-keeping . <p> " There needs to be a cultural change . This is just as important as the social work itself . " <h> Oranga Tamariki responds <p> Oranga Tamariki 's National Director of Youth Justice Services and Residential Care Iain Chapman said capturing high quality information in records , plans and review was " an ongoing area of focus for our practice in residences and homes " . <p> " As part of our response to the Rapid Review , and in line with our organisational focus on ensuring residents are operating safely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Chapman said in a statement . <p> " This includes increasing the induction period for new staff , trialling new reporting systems , rolling out training for frontline leaders and standard operating procedures to define good practice operational responses in youth justice residences . <p> " There are specific standard operating procedures for use of secure care and use of force , " he said . <p> " We acknowledge that technology and several of our legacy systems can be a barrier to the quality of recording and reporting that we would like to see . This was recognised by the government , and we have been allocated specific Budget 2024 funding to upgrade our case and care management systems . " <p> While the average rate for remand reviews sat above 90 percent , they were not always recorded in a timely manner , Chapman said . <p> " On the occasions when there are delays in completing remand review case notes , this does not impact how long the young person stays in the residence .

" <p> The briefing said this included : <p> * Rainfall predictions for Westland that were significantly higher than MetService 's warnings . <p> * A forecast of " very dry " conditions for the area west of Motueka through April 12 , despite a MetService severe weather watch later upgraded to a warning for heavy rain . <p> * Rainfall forecasts for Otago and Southland ( both inland and near the coast ) that were far in excess of MetService forecasts and warnings . <p> " MetService staff were able to alert the Ministry of Transport quickly and ensure the TRT group was provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this highlights the potential for confusion among government agencies responding to a crisis event . <p> " The competing narrative from Niwa , which had the potential to undermine the warning system , was unhelpful and a good example of unproductive competition , " the briefing said . <p> Also released under the OIA was a letter from MetService chief executive Stephen Hunt to his Niwa counterpart , John Morgan , on June 23 last year , outlining three occasions on which Niwa commentary jarred with MetService 's official warnings for heavy rain and strong winds . <p> On two of these -- May 19 and May 29 , 2023 -- " Niwa commentators appeared on national media and discussed the current weather forecasts in detail " . <p> " Each time , they failed to mention the official severe weather watches and warnings which were in force , and instead presented Niwa 's alternative views " . <p> On June 23 , 2023 , with a MetService " red " warning issued for Gisborne , where a local state of emergency and evacuations were taking place , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced a " conflicting and confusing communication " , Mr Hunt 's letter said . <p> That was in the form of a post on X , with a map showing the only place with a " high chance " of 100mm or more of rain was in the Ruahine Range southwest of Waiouru . <p> Niwa also used the same colours as MetService 's red and orange warnings , and yellow watches , on the map to delineate high chance , medium chance and low chance . <p> Mr Hunt said it remained MetService 's view that conflicting warnings " in particular from other government organisations , can lead to confusion and erosion in public safety when severe weather presents a risk to life and infrastructure " . <p> " Again , I ask your Niwa Weather spokespeople to use the official severe-weather watch and warning information that MetService provides during warning-level events , and to play their part in consistent public-safety messaging , " his letter said . <p> Asked for comment on these cases , a Niwa spokeswoman said : " We are aware of MetService 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

" <p> Brazier said " poor communication " was the main issue with a shorter change period . <p> " We need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration behind that , so that we 're consistent with what the legislation and the regulations say and that does take some time . " <p> Chambers was also asked about his position on whether or not the gun registry should remain with police , given it was set to be moved out of the department this term as part of ACT 's coalition agreement with National . <p> " I will take time to consider how our registry could be most effective and if that means remaining within New Zealand Police then that 's , I 'm sure , what will happen and if there 's a better way of doing something , we 'll consider that too , " Chambers said . <p> " I think one of the things I 've always said in policing is that when we apply a good deal of common sense to everything that we do , we communicate well and we take time to do that we will be our best too so it 's no different situation involving registry .
